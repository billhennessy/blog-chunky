People like knowing which stories other people read in huge numbers. Here's a list of the most-read posts of all time on Hennessy's View. 

You'll notice that many of the most-read posts are not directly political. These *obliquely* political stories are, by far, the most popular. 

The other interesting thing is the staying-power of some of these stories. The second most-read story of all time, Is the Earth's Axis Shifting? was published on March 9, 2008. Twelve years later, this story still gets thousands of views every month. 

This list isn't always up to date, but it's pretty good representation of the most-read posts of all time.
