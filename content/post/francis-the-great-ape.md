In 1948, then Monsignor Fulton Sheen warned the world that Catholic Church would be eclipsed by a false religion. 

> In the midst of all his seeming love for humanity and his glib talk of freedom and equality, he will have one great secret which he will tell to no one: he will not believe in God. Because his religion will be brotherhood without the fatherhood of God, he will deceive even the elect. He will set up a counterchurch which will be the ape of the Church, because he, the Devil, is the ape of God. It will have all the notes and characteristics of the Church, but in reverse and emptied of its divine content. It will be a mystical body of the Antichrist that will in all externals resemble the mystical body of Christ. . . .
>
> . . . But the twentieth century will join the counterchurch because it claims to be infallible when its visible head speaks ex cathedra from Moscow on the subject of economics and politics, and as chief shepherd of world communism.

> — Fulton J. Sheen, 1948

No one alive today could better describe the Catholic Church under Jorge Bergoglio, aka "Pope Francis." 

And if Bergoglio's church is the ape of the Church, that makes Bergoglio the ape of a pope. The Great Ape who "speaks ex cathedra . . . on the subject of economics and politics" and environmentalism and vaccines.
