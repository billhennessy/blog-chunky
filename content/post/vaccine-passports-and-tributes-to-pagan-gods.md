Dying empires fight hard to control the threats surrounding them. Like wounded beasts, they lash out at anything within their reach. 

So it was that, amidst a century of decline, the Roman emperor Decius decided to end the Christian problem once and for all. He simply required everyone in the empire to pay a one-time public tribute to a Roman god. 

Decius set up a distribution system for the tributes so that citizens and non could simply walk up to a table in a marketplace and offer a libation to the god of their choice, free of charge. 

"Then you'd get a little certificate with your name on it saying that you had been seen making a sacrifice to the gods, signed by official witnesses.\[^1\]"

\[^1\]: Aquilina, Mark, 2019, _The Church and the Roman Empire_, Ave Maria Press
