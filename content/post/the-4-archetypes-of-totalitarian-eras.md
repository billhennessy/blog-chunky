Would you have resisted and defied the Nazis if you'd lived in Germany in the 1930s? 

Would you have defied the Jewish authorities to plead for Jesus' life had you lived in Jerusalem in 33 A.D.?

Would you have defied the Bolsheviks in Russia in 1917? 

I hypothesized that the vast majority of people regardless of where they live (or when) would behave as most Germans and most Jews did at those critical moments. 

In the case of Jesus, we can actually see the numbers. Jesus had thousands of followers. Most of them remained faithful to Him through his persecution and crucifixion. But only four had the courage to stand at the foot of the cross and witness his execution: the three Marys and John.

Some, let's assume dozens, lined the Via Dolorosa to comfort Him when he carried the cross to Golgotha. 

His apostles, aside from John, hid but remained faithful, as did most of his disciples.

On the other hand, hundreds actively advocated for his crucifixion before Pilate. Most likely paid little attention. They simply went about their daily lives. 

Americans will soon face such an epochal decision regarding totalitarianism. 

* **Advocates**: A vocal minority will advocate for totalitarianism, internment camps, mass arrests, and even genocide of those who oppose the regime. This faction is already active and has been for a long time. Advocates will be about four to six percent of the population.
* **Adapters**: A large majority will ignore and adapt to whatever happens, ignoring their own consciences. If you live in a Republican suburb, you are surrounded by these people. Sixty percent of Americans will become adapters
* **Dissenters**: Many will quietly dissent from the regime and perform small, safe acts of defiance, the way the Apostles hid during Christ's Passion. About 32 percent of Americans will become dissenters.
* **Zealots**: A tiny sliver of freedom lovers will openly defy and resist the regime, and many of them will die because of their resistance. Only about two percent of us will have the courage to become zealots by risking our lives and fortunes to oppose the regime.

That adaptive majority will hate the tiny sliver of zealots. Dissenters will resent the zealots, too, fearing the zealots' open defiance will bring harsher persecutions. Guilt will also play a factor in the dissenters' animosity toward the zealots whom they will see as heroic compared to themselves. 

While adapters will happily rat out zealots and dissenters, dissenters would never turn in a zealot. Advocates, of course, will not only turn in the zealots and dissenters, they will try to force the adapters to join or die.
