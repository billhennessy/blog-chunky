The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines could trigger an avalanche of early-onset Alzheimer's and other degenerative neurological diseases.<br /><br />The zombie apocalypse you've read about is coming, and it will resemble _No Exit_ more than _The Walking Dead_. Assuming this report in _Microbiology and Infectious Disease_ is accurate, the world could soon face a zombie apocalypse far more psychologically terrifying than any portrayed in movies, books, and television. In those media, the zombies are already dead. They are a clear and present danger to the living. They can and must be killed for the survival of individuals and the species.<br /><br />{{< figure src="/images/zombie-apocalypse-3.jpg" caption="Zombie apocalypse battleground in fiction." title="Zombies Attack" >}}<br /><br />### Late Middle Age<br /><br />Imagine you're in your 50s with five adult children living in various places around the country. You've recently become a grandparent with a second grandchild on the way.<br /><br />You recently buried your last parent and feel somehow alone and vulnerable. There is no prior generation to guide you, correct your mistakes, and celebrate your tiny wins in life. You are the elder statesman of your family, the chronological pioneer, the last court of appeal for family disputes.<br /><br />On the other hand, your day-to-day responsibilities are winding down. More of your work is done through other people. Financially, you can afford to hire a handyman to do little things around the house you don't want to do. You no longer have to be home to fix the kids' dinner and help with their homework. You are long past the stage of managing baths and making sure they have clean clothes. If you go to a little league game, it's your pleasure to cheer the grandkids, not your obligation to socialize your child.<br /><br />In a sense, freedom abounds. So, you find yourself thinking about your legacy. How can you leave a mark on the world? What can you do in your remain productive years to leave the world better than you found it?<br /><br />Suddenly, though, your plans are at risk.<br /><br />### Zombie Apocalypse Begins<br /><br />Your 32-year-old son, who lives in a distant state, is having cognitive issues. He needs to come home for a while. Probably just a while. The doctors assured him, at his age, this is probably a metabolic issue. But he is single and needs supervision because of temporary memory lapses and confusion.<br /><br />The boy comes home and is frustrated and, if would admit it, scared. Sometimes he doesn't recognize his parents. His best friend, Joe, who was at the house the day before, is to him a total stranger today. But an hour later, he's asking why Joe hasn't called. Meanwhile, you are now forced to work from home to keep an eye on your son. He could burn the house down or get lost on a walk around the neighborhood. And he cannot drive, of course, though he often asks to borrow the car, so you have to take him to various clinics and hospitals for the endless tests that always result in "nothing here."<br /><br />Meanwhile, your daughter who lives nearby requires more frequent help with your granddaughter. The child is only two and a half, but your daughter is having problems "keeping up with everything." Her house is a disaster with clothes and empty pizza boxes and toys. Just a year ago, her house was spotless, and she needed little help with the baby. Combined with your son's issues, you spend most or all of your free time caring for your adult children. Your own house is falling to pieces.<br /><br />Then you get the report on the middle child. He has been discharged from the Marine Corps for increasingly reckless behavior and insubordination. He missed muster numerous times, suffering several non-judicial punishments, but the Corps finally gave up on him. He is somewhere in Southern California checking in infrequently, ensuring you that everything is okay. But you have few details. And this was the one who had been rising through the ranks in the Corps at a ridiculous pace, winning medals and commendations almost every month. What changed?<br /><br />In less than six months, your feeling of the freedom that comes with senior has turned into the prison cell of your own life. You would compare your current list of responsibilities to the time when you had five children living at home, except for one frightening difference: then, your children became more mature each day. Now, they become more dependent by the week. It dawns on you that you will have soon have to choose between continuing to hold a job or continuing to care for increasingly disabled adult children.<br /><br />You look at your finances and realize there is no choice. You cannot afford to retire ten years short of Social Security eligibility. You cannot afford to hire full-time nannies for three children in the 20s and 30s, plus a two-year-old baby. You will have to turn your children over to the state and, perhaps, seek custody of the grandchild.<br /><br />### Searching for an Explanation<br /><br />A recent Microbiology and Infection Disease report may explain how your life suddenly and precipitously collapses into a nightmare of guilt and sorrow.<br /><br />The abstract of the report explains what triggered your zombie apocalypse:<br /><br />> Development of new vaccine technology has been plagued with problems in the past. The current RNA based SARS- CoV-2 vaccines were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long term safety testing. In this paper the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in vaccine recipients.[^1]<br /><br />The new vaccine is not like any vaccine today. It works by altering the human genome to trigger a more violent immune reaction to the presence of viruses like the Coronavirus. In medical terms, the report explains:<br /><br />> The RNA sequence of the vaccine as well as the spike protein target interaction were analyzed for the potential to convert intracellular RNA binding proteins TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) into their pathologic prion conformations. The results indicate that the vaccine RNA has specific sequences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations.[^2]<br /><br />In other words, the COVID vaccine can trigger the events that produce severe neurological illness, including Alzheimer's disease, even in the young.<br /><br />> In the current analysis a total of sixteen UG tandem repeats (ΨGΨG) were identified and additional UG (ΨG) rich sequences were identified. Two GGΨA sequences were found. Potential G Quadruplex sequences are possibly present but a more sophisticated computer program is needed to verify these. Furthermore, the spike protein, created by the translation of the vaccine RNA, binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a zinc containing enzyme. This interaction has the potential to increase intracellular zinc. Zinc ions have been shown to cause the transformation of TDP-43 to its pathologic prion configuration. **The folding of TDP-43 and FUS into their pathologic prion confirmations is known to cause ALS, front temporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological degenerative diseases**.[^3]<br /><br />And the report delivers this conclusion:<br /><br />> The enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that **the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit**.[^4]<br /><br />You can download the [entire report here](/images/covid19-rna-based-vaccines-and-the-risk-of-prion-disease-1503.pdf).<br /><br />Despite your warnings, three of your children rushed out to get the shot. One was pressured to do so by the Marines. Your daughter was afraid of succumbing to COVID and being unable to care for the baby. The other son believed getting vaccinated was the right thing to do because he trusts authorities.<br /><br />Three of your children have entered a rapid cognitive decline into helplessness. Your legacy won't involve some grand or even pedestrian improvement to the world. The mission for the rest of your life will be to keep your children safe as they slip through the fingers of life.<br /><br />### Zombies You Won't Kill<br /><br />If you've noticed, Millennials are the most eager, even desperate, to get the shot. They won't go out to meet friends. "I haven't gotten my second shot yet, so I can't go," they say. Or, "I'm going to be out next Tuesday. The only place I could the shot is over two hours away. I had to use my grandmother's address." (I don't even know what that means, but I assume some geographical rationing schemes are going on with the vaccine's distribution.)<br /><br />Killing something that is trying to kill you is psychologically satisfying and morally acceptable. Self-defense is permitted in the strictest of pro-life theologies, and lethal force to protect the innocent is mandatory.<br /><br />In the vaccine-induced apocalypse, though, the zombies are not brain-eating post-mortem enemies but our children whom we love. They are not trying to kill us but merely to make sense of, to their deteriorating brains, an increasingly chaotic and confusing world.<br /><br />{{< figure src="/images/dementia-ward.jpg" caption="The battleground of the coming zombie apocalypse." title="Dementia Ward" >}}<br /><br />Those who have watched parent's descent into Alzheimer's oblivion or ALS's paralysis shudder at the thought of seeing the same happen to their children in the prime of life.<br /><br />But Alzheimer's and ALS remain rare despite efforts by governments and big medicine to increase their frequency. What if billions of young adults turned into Alzheimer's zombies or ALS cripples in a few short years? Who would care for them? Who would do the work of keeping civilization going, the strongest, most resilient generations having been reduced to homebound or institutionalized patients?<br /><br />The entire weight of the world would literally fall upon the [relatively few Holdouts](/this-is-what-will-happen/) who refused to take part in Pfizer's experiment with gene therapy. Just 10 percent or so of the world's population would be forced care for the 90 percent who took the shot. And the holdouts would most likely be those 50 or older and those 10 or younger.<br /><br />Are you ready for that reality?<br /><br />The next battle may not be political (and war, remember, is politics on a different plane). The next battle for humanity might be as simple and squalid as a few old and young people trying to care for a disabled majority who is stronger than they are.<br /><br />And this situation was predicted by a former Astronomer Royal nearly 20 years ago. We will look at Sir Martin Rees's warning in a future post. Stay tuned.<br /><br />[^1]: Classen JB. COVID-19 RNA Based Vaccines and the Risk of Prion Disease.

Self-defense is permitted in the strictest of pro-life theologies, and lethal force to protect the innocent is mandatory.<br /><br />In the vaccine-induced apocalypse, though, the zombies are not brain-eating post-mortem enemies but our children whom we love. They are not trying to kill us but merely to make sense of, to their deteriorating brains, an increasingly chaotic and confusing world.<br /><br />{{< figure src="/images/dementia-ward.jpg" caption="The battleground of the coming zombie apocalypse." title="Dementia Ward" >}}<br /><br />Those who have watched a parent's descent into Alzheimer's oblivion or ALS's paralysis shudder at the thought of seeing the same happen to their children in the prime of life.<br /><br />But Alzheimer's and ALS remain rare despite efforts by governments and big medicine to increase their frequency. What if billions of young adults turned into Alzheimer's zombies or ALS cripples in a few short years? Who would care for them? Who would do the work of keeping civilization going, the strongest, most resilient generations having been reduced to homebound or institutionalized patients?<br /><br />The entire weight of the world would literally fall upon the [relatively few Holdouts](/this-is-what-will-happen/) who refused to take part in Pfizer's experiment with gene therapy. Just 10 percent or so of the world's population would be forced care for the 90 percent who took the shot. And the holdouts would most likely be those 50 or older and those 10 or younger.<br /><br />Are you ready for that reality?<br /><br />The next battle may not be political (and war, remember, is politics on a different plane). The next battle for humanity might be as simple and squalid as a few old and young people trying to care for a disabled majority who is stronger than they are.<br /><br />And this situation was predicted by a former Astronomer Royal nearly 20 years ago. We will look at Sir Martin Rees's warning in a future post. Stay tuned.<br /><br />[^1]: Classen JB. COVID-19 RNA Based Vaccines and the Risk of Prion Disease.
