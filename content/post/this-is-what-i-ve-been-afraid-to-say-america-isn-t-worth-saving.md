You're probably going to hate me for saying this. You might even unsubscribe from my email. You'll wish I still had a Facebook and Twitter account so you could unfriend me.

You will be angry because you know what I am about to write is true. You will be angry because _you have already thought this yourself_. You have avoided saying it out loud because you can't fathom the thought of being right. The unbearable weight of the truth.

How can one who calls himself a 'patriot' even think such a subversive thought? If looking lustfully at a woman is to commit adultery in one's heart, then thinking _this_ about the United States of America must surely be treason of the heart.

I promise you that I have thought it all and more. Whatever condemnation you conjure up for the thoughts I express here, I have already conjured myself.

Being a coward, of course, I didn't come right out and say what I knew back in 2018. Instead, I trickled out the message in long, laborious blogs. I was hoping some fine reader would say the magic words for me. I trickled the story, which is only five words long, through dozens of posts:

* [What Should We Do Next?](https://www.hennessysview.com/2018/08/10/what-should-we-do-next/)
* [The End of America](https://www.hennessysview.com/the-end-of-america/)
* [Winner Take All Election](https://www.hennessysview.com/winner-take-all-election/)
* [This Is What Will Happen](https://www.hennessysview.com/this-is-what-will-happen/)
* and, finally, [I Don't Know How I Know These Things](https://www.hennessysview.com/i-dont-know/)

I now realize that no one wants to go first. No one in my circles, anyway. We want to pretend we believe America's best days are ahead of us, that Republicans will man up and retake the House and Senate in 2022, then restore Donald Trump or one of his kids in 2024. That those silent and invisible "good, honest, patriotic" FBI agents will rise up and arrest their evil overlords in the DOJ. That 2025 will look remarkably like 1985. Or 1955. Or 1795.

That's what we tell ourselves. That's what we tell our friends. That's what we post on Gab.

Yet we all know it's all lies.

For good or ill, my fellow Americans, I now have the courage to write this because **Milo** **Yiannopoulos** had the courage to say it first:

{{< figure src="/images/6d851d8c-77f1-4ae0-b1ee-5ae6e9463ea0_1_201_a.jpeg" caption="" title="" >}}

> Quite soon, all at once and apparently out of nowhere, three generations of right-leaning Americans will spontaneously lose all faith in the system. They will simultaneously realize there isn’t a single remaining institution they can trust and **they will admit that there is nothing worth reforming in American culture and politics**. What happens next?

Now, finally, I can say it: **America is not worth saving**!

We "right-leaning" folks have two memories of America. One memory comes from our oral tradition, the stories of America handed down to us by our parents and teachers, by old movies and books, through our study of history. 

Our other memory comes from our lived experience. We remember things. Sure, those memories were filtered through the lens of that oral tradition, but we witnessed history. We understood that socialism doesn't work, that those who refuse to work shall not eat, that man seeks to better himself, that every attempt at socialism ended in abject failure. 

Most of all, we knew and know today that, absent the grace of God, we can do nothing but sin. As a creature and as a nation, our nature is, at best, weak and selfish, at worst diabolical. 

In our love of the idea of America, we refused to admit that America kicked God out long ago. Probably the 1950s. Certainly, in the 1960s. We gave a God probationary readmittance in the Carter and Reagan years from 1977 to 1989, but we soon kicked Him out again. Or, more accurately, we rescinded His probation. 

At that point, we were on our own, left to our own natures and our own devices. 

For some foolish reason, probably hubris, we still believed that our own good natures and two centuries of breeding would allow us to remain a "moral" nation even without God's saving grace. We believed that our past would somehow form our future. That we had banked enough grace by 1990 to carry us on forever and ever. 

But that didn't happen. 

Somewhere between the first Gulf War and 2018, our well of grace ran dry. America went morally bankrupt. We were running on fumes provided almost exclusively by Donald Trump. And I knew our engine was sputtering when I wrote in _What Should We Do Next_:

> For the time being, President Trump holds our torturers and persecutors at bay. But Trump won’t be president forever. He could be out of office a year from now should the Democrats take over the House and Senate in January. And, if Trump is impeached and convicted, the future President Pence has little chance of winning in 2020.
