You're probably going to hate me for saying this. You might even unsubscribe from my email. You'll wish I still had a Facebook and Twitter account so you could unfriend me.

You will be angry because you know what I am about to write is true. You will be angry because _you have already thought this yourself_. You have avoided saying it out loud because you can't fathom the thought of being right. The unbearable weight of the truth.

How can one who calls himself a 'patriot' even think such a subversive thought? If looking lustfully at a woman is to commit adultery in one's heart, then thinking _this_ about the United States of America must surely be treason of the heart.

I promise you that I have thought it all and more. Whatever condemnation you conjure up for the thoughts I express here, I have already conjured myself.

Being a coward, of course, I didn't come right out and say what I knew back in 2018. Instead, I trickled out the message in long, laborious blogs. I was hoping some fine reader would say the magic words for me. Someone more courageous and honest than I am.

I now realize that no one wants to go first. No one in my circles, anyway. We want to pretend we believe America's best days are ahead of us, that Republicans will man up and retake the House and Senate in 2022, then restore Donald Trump or one of his kids in 2024. That those silent and invisible "good, honest, patriotic" FBI agents will rise up and arrest their evil overlords in the DOJ. That 2025 will look remarkably like 1985. Or 1955. Or 1795.

That's what we tell ourselves. That's what we tell our friends. That's what we post on Gab.

Yet we all know it's all lies.

For good or ill, my fellow Americans, I now have the courage to write this because **Milo** **Yiannopoulos** had the courage to say it first:
