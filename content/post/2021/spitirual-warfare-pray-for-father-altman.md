Fr. James Altman likes the phrase "abundance of courage," and the phrase perfectly describes his holy ministry. 

Decrying the US bishops closing churches and denying the faithful access to the sacraments "out of an abundance of caution," Altman countered, "No! We must act out of an **abundance of COURAGE!**" 

Now, because of Fr. Altman's courageous preaching of the truth of Jesus Christ and the constant teachings of the Church since the Apostles, Bishop William Callahan of the Diocese of La Crosse, Wisconsin. Father Altman, to no one's surprise, has vowed to fight. 

**Set aside 20 minutes today to say a Rosary for Fr. Altman.**

Father Altman became famous in 2020 with his courage homily "Catholics Cannot Vote Democrat." Of course, Bishop Callahan disliked that. "Divisive," he called it. The truth is, indeed, divisive, Your Excellency. And if you remember the Bible, Jesus told us so. 

> "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword." (Matthew 10:34)
 
> "Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but division." (Luke 12:51)

> Jesus said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.  On hearing it, many of His disciples said, “This is a difficult teaching. Who can accept it?” . . . From that time on many of His disciples turned back and no longer walked with Him. (John 6:59-60,66)

Most Catholic bishops seem more terrified of being rejected by the world than they are of going to hell for eternity. They seek the praise of men even if it means losing friendship with Christ. 

Does Bishop Callahan not know that you cannot be a friend of Jesus and of the world?

> "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first." (John 15:18)

> “Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely  on my account.  Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for  so they persecuted the prophets who were before you." (Matthew 5:11-12)

### Join the Auxilium Christianorum for St. Michael the Archangel's Protection of Persecuted Priests

Father Altman is being persecuted for preaching the Gospel in bold and clear words. His persecutors are fighting on behalf of Satan, and they include his own bishop. 

This is spiritual warfare, friends. Human works will be of no value unless they are they are inspired by the Holy Ghost for the greater glory of God. For, without God's grace, man can do nothing but sin. 

Father Richard Heilman of US Grace Force has asked all the faithful to say the daily prayers of the Auxilium Christianorum for persecuted priests like Fr. Altman. 

> Monday, May 24 is the Feast of Mary Mother of the Church. It is also the Feast of [Mary Help of Christians](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001U9kzFVHFrHE_hqCVe5i2RKHN_BQro1OSNmIY4ZT4T0cGCHRN23bdnr8Rpuw4F4qvJml8qJWG8gJLP-3Vp42Gtr7jCPLYVJJlyS7fhJKhGRCk34HpPC7XyuQ404pPRIelsvMaMceG473mLU_mp9W5f-DncFakin-FN3x2CDj6nkeJFE5ArL8E0dVY4XQWAYQAZmayOIeZBhouwBtLScjG_qVcZymbT_ycurLsU50Ql_o85IbnRVfnSg==&c=yTiEDBDmVU9UoZqYmlCslwMEP-U7CwhSGKblMSn95ZH5dnGXxCQAIA==&ch=rZ4q35RlLSWPyyCClBcyAXBvluMBcDyrAC8j7jyZUht5ypnmzbWoaA==) (Auxilium Christianorum). Please consider joining this Auxilium Christianorum family to pray daily for our holy and courageous persecuted priests.

> The Church teaches us that it is divided into the  _Church Triumphant_  (which includes the members of the Church in heaven), the  _Church Suffering_  (this includes the members of the Church in purgatory), and the  _Church Militant_  (this refers to those members of the Church who are alive in this world). Because we are part of the Church Militant, we are in a spiritual warfare and this spiritual warfare requires that we recognize, as Saint Paul teaches us “For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places.” (_Ephesians 6:12_)
> 
> The members of the Auxilium Christianorum should always bear in mind the reality of our state as members of the Church living in this world. Despite St. Paul’s teaching, many Catholics do not take seriously their obligation to wage war against the demonic forces. It is for this reason the Association of the Auxilium Christianorum was founded.

(Note: Be in a state of grace when praying the Auxilium Christianorum. Otherwise, you run the risk of inviting demonic retaliation.)

In addition to the Auxilium Christianorum, I urge everyone to pray the Rosary today specifically for Fr. Altman. May God give him strength as he fights the enemy. Pray also that God lifts the scales from Bishop Callahan's eyes and softens the bishop's heart which is as cold and hard at the pharaoh's. 

And never forget, brothers and sisters, the teachings of St. Paul:
