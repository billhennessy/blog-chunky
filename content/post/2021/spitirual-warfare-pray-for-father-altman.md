Fr. James Altman likes the phrase "abundance of courage," and the phrase perfectly describes his holy ministry. 

Decrying the US bishops closing churches and denying the faithful access to the sacraments "out of an abundance of caution," Altman countered, "No! We must act out of an **abundance of COURAGE!**" 

Now, because of Fr. Altman's courageous preaching of the truth of Jesus Christ and the constant teachings of the Church since the Apostles, Bishop William Callahan of the Diocese of La Crosse, Wisconsin. Father Altman, to no one's surprise, has vowed to fight. 

**Set aside 20 minutes today to say a Rosary for Fr. Altman.**

Father Altman became famous in 2020 with his courage homily "Catholics Cannot Vote Democrat." Of course, Bishop Callahan disliked that. "Divisive," he called it. The truth is, indeed, divisive, Your Excellency. And if you remember the Bible, Jesus told us so. 

> "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword." (Matthew 10:34)
 
> "Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but division." (Luke 12:51)

> Jesus said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.  On hearing it, many of His disciples said, “This is a difficult teaching. Who can accept it?” . . . From that time on many of His disciples turned back and no longer walked with Him. (John 6:59-60,66)

Most Catholic bishops seem more terrified of being rejected by the world than they are of going to hell for eternity. They seek the praise of men even if it means losing friendship with Christ. 

Does Bishop Callahan not know that you cannot be a friend of Jesus and of the world?

> "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first." (John 15:18)

> “Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely  on my account.  Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for  so they persecuted the prophets who were before you." (Matthew 5:11-12)

### Join the Auxilium Christianorum for St. Michael the Archangel's Protection of Persecuted Priests

Father Altman is being persecuted for preaching the Gospel in bold and clear words. His persecutors are fighting on behalf of Satan, and they include his own bishop. 

This is spiritual warfare, friends. Human works will be of no value unless they are they are inspired by the Holy Ghost for the greater glory of God. For, without God's grace, man can do nothing but sin. 

Father Richard Heilman of US Grace Force has asked all the faithful to say the daily prayers of the Auxilium Christianorum for persecuted priests like Fr. Altman.
