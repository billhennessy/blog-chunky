Fr. James Altman coined the phrase "abundance of courage," and the phrase perfectly describes his holy ministry. 

Decrying the US bishops closing churches and denying the faithful access to the sacraments "out of an abundance of caution," Altman countered, "No! We must act out of an **abundance of COURAGE!**" 

Now, because of Fr. Altman's courageous preaching of the truth of Jesus Christ and the constant teachings of the Church since the Apostles, Bishop William Callahan of the Diocese of La Crosse, Wisconsin. Father Altman, to no one's surprise, has vowed to fight. 

**Set aside 20 minutes today to say a Rosary for Fr. Altman.**

Father Altman became famous in 2020 with his courage homily "Catholics Cannot Vote Democrat." Of course, Bishop Callahan disliked that. "Divisive," he called it. The truth is, indeed, divisive, Your Excellency. And if you remember the Bible, Jesus told us so. 

"Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword." (Matthew 10:34)

"Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but division." (Luke 12:51)
