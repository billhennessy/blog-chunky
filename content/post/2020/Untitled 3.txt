When News Was True

Ever watch a baseball game called by the other team's announcers? They spin everything in their team's favor. They find no fault in a terrible call by an ump that goes against you team. They brag about some crappy .223 hitters on their time like he's the next Ted Williams. 

But they don't lie about the facts of the game. If the umpire calls a pitch a strike, they might tell you it was a bad call, but the don't lie and say it was ball four. 

That's how it felt watching the news when I was young. Almost everyone involved in any form of news was a liberal. The spun everything in the Democrats favor. They complained whenever Ronald Reagan opened his mouth. But, for the mot part, they reported what actually happened. If the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 50 points (which was a huge jump in the 80s), they would report that, then explain how the jump had nothing to do with Reagan's economic policies. 

Something has changed, though. Today, if the Dow jumps 500 points, CNN will tell you it dropped a thousand. Or they will pretend their is no Dow Jones Industrial Average. Or markets were closed. 

Today's reporters stand in front of burning cities while dodging bricks and bullets and tell you "this is a peaceful protest." A laptop containing evidence of felonies committed by a former Vice President who happens to be the nominee for president doesn't even get a mention. As if the DJIA doesn't exist. 

What has changed about journalism since the days of liberals David Brinkley, John Chancellor, and Walter Cronkite is pride. The older journalists took pride in presenting the truth, even if they wish it weren't so. Today's journalists lie to get their way. They tell their audiences the runner was called safe at second when the umpire called him out. They tell you a pop fly to the short stop was actually a grand slam home run. And if their team loses, they tell you the game was rained out.
