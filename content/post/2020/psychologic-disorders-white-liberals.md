Liberals of all ages and races are twice as likely to suffer from mental illness than conservatives. 

Researchers have identified a strong correlation between liberalism and mental illness.The correlation is so powerful that almost **one in two young white liberals have been diagnosed with mental health disorders** according to Pew American Trends research.

We have identified four major takeaways from this research, conducted earlier this year:

1. Nearly 1 in 2 (45.9%) of white liberals have been diagnosed with mental health disorders.
2. White liberals of all ages are more than twice as likely as conservatives of any age to suffer from mental health disorders.
3. White liberals are almost twice as likely as non-white liberals to be diagnosed with mental health problems. 
4. Among conservatives of all ages, there is very little difference in the rates of mental disorders between whites and non-whites.

Liberals will, of course, throw out a flurry of excuses and say we're reading these number wrong. They'll say that liberals are more likely than conservatives to seek help for mental disorders. (There's no evidence of that, but they'll say it.)

They'll also say that non-whites lack access to mental health services. This is racist, of course. It's the same as saying, "non-white liberals are just as crazy as white liberals; they just haven't been diagnosed."

The fact remains that white liberals are twice as likely to have mental problems that conservatives. But we don't know the cause/effect relationship. 

Does mental illness lead people to become liberals, or does liberalism cause mental illness?
