Christmas begins on December 25 and lasts 40 days. 

Christmas Season does not begin when Walmart turns its Lawn and Garden section into the "Holiday" section. Christmas begins on Christmas Day and runs for 40 days. 

Within Christmastide is the Octave of Christmas, an octave being eight. The Octave of Christmas begins with Solemnity of the Nativity of Our Lord on December 25 and ends with the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ on January 1, eight days inclusive. 

> And the Word was made flesh  
> And dwelt among us

Celebrations of Christmas—the parties, the gifts, the joy, the spirit—belong in those eight and 40 days, not before. 

Advent is not a time of partying, but a period of penance and preparing. But, like almost everything else in the modern world, we do it wrong. 

Christmas parties happen *before* the birth of Christ. It would be like holding a Super Bowl victory parade the week before the game instead of after. This practice of putting the celebration before the event obscures the meaning of Christmas. It's also stupid and presumptuous. This presumption hides the mystery. In the year 1 BC, no one knew the day a woman would give birth. Let's suspend our certainty and put ourselves in the shoes of Mary and Joseph. We know her time is near, but we know not the day nor the hour. So we prepare. 

This year, try treating Advent more like Lent. Give things up. No alcohol, let's say. Or fast and abstain from meat on Wednesdays and Fridays. Skip the parties, or attend briefly as a courtesy. 

Also, try making Christmastide the celebration season instead of Advent. This makes more sense, anyway. Many companies close the week between Christmas and New Year's, or allow many people to take vacation that week. It's a better time for partying and more in keeping with the spirit of the season. 

Be less concerned about seeing people *before* Christmas, and use the copious free time of the Octave of Christmas to get together, exchange gifts, and drink. 

And remember why we do this revelry at all. We celebrate the birth of Christ our Savior.
