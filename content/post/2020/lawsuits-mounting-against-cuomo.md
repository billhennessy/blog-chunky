New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who ordered elderly COVID-19 patients to nursing homes where they infected and killed over 5,000, is facing a barrage of lawsuits from victims' families and, potentially, from the nursing homes themselves.

As we previously reported, Cuomo used emergency powers to force nursing homes to house and treat elderly COVID-19 patients instead of sending the patients one of New York's many COVID-19 field hospitals. Cuomo himself said that nursing homes were "like a feeding frenzy for the virus." 

The only logical explanation for Cuomo's move, as explained here, was to reduce the nursing home population in New York in order to save money. 


On Sunday, the governor defended the move because old people are going to die, anyway:

Now, relatives of people killed or sickened by Cuomo's policy are preparing lawsuits.
