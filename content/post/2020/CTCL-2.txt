# County Councilman Tim Fitch and Rep. Dottie Bailey Stave Off Ballot Harvesting in St. Louis County

Guest post by [Bill Hennessy](https://hennessysview.com).

Last night, the St. Louis County Council met. One controversial agenda item: expedited acceptance of cash from the Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL), a hard-left organization that helps steal elections. 

Shortly after a $10 million grant to Philadelphia, nearly doubling the city's election budget of $12 million, poll watchers were kicked out of election headquarters. 

Last week The Gateway Pundit reported [the Trump campaign was forced to sue Philadelphia for blocking poll watchers](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/10/breaking-trump-campaign-sues-philedelphia-city-officials-blocking-trump-election-observers-entering-polling-stations/) from polling places. Via [Influence Watch](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/center-for-tech-and-civic-life/):

> In August 2020, CTCL gave $10 million to the city of Philadelphia. Philadelphia's elections office has an annual budget of $12.3 million.


Conservative journalist Michelle Malkin has been sounding the alarm over CTCL in recent weeks.

The CTCL is using the China Virus as an excuse to steal elections:

The Gateway Pundit reported Sunday that [St. Louis County Council was considering its own grant](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/10/danger-st-louis-county-executive-sam-page-connected-ballot-harvesting-specialists-also-operating-wisconsin-pennsylvania/) from this sleazy outfit. But that proposal was vetoed by County Councilman and former St. Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch.

State Rep. Dottie Bailey (R-110) alerted Fitch and others of the CLCT's vote-stealing ways. 

"I saw the story on Jim Hoft's blog [The Gateway Pundit] and thought, 'this has to stop.' So, I called Tim [Fitch]. Of course, he was all over it and vetoed it."

But St. Louis County is not out of the woods just yet. 

According to Bailey, Tuesday's vote concerned only *expedited* approval of the grant from CTCL. The proposal will re-appear next week on a non-expedited agenda. 

"People need to call their council member and tell them, 'hell no,'" Bailey said.
