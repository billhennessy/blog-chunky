Civil disobedience has been in the news recently. People are refusing to obey tyrannical mandates from government and busybodies. Good for them. But that's not really civil disobedience. That's just living. 

The only true civil disobedience is obedience to God. And nothing will anger the civil authorities more living a pious life. 

The world is Satan's domain. Everything in is under his immediate control. Philosophy, art, music, entertainment, politics, and even Coronavirus recommendations from the CDC.

These things are always "satanic" in the Hollywood meaning of "satanic." Voting is not akin to conjuring demons. But, in the big scheme of things, everything you do and think pleases God or please Satan. It's black and white. There are no morally neutral acts. 

There are very anti-moral acts, like worshipping a god (demon) other than the Trinitarian God revealed in the Torah and fulfilled in the Gospels. That's the biggest sin of all. 

Worshipping other gods is also the most common sin of all, believe it or not. We do it every day. 

Environmentalist wackos like Pope Francis, for instance, put nature and the demon-gods of nature, like Pachamama, before God. Yes, God made man steward over the earth, but God created earth. The earth exists because God lets it, and nothing man can do will change that without God's permission. We are to be good stewards, but not so good that we neglect or interfere with God. (Or try to.) 

Likewise, the Coronavirus zealots who demand that we pay homage to humanity by not worshipping God the way God commanded us to worship Him are praying to demon-god. Humans are not demons, but, believe, there are demons in charge of humanity. They influence people to human things before Godly things, and they use positive-sounding arguments. But refusing to do what God has asked because doing so might upset other humans is most definitely a form of devil worship. 

 Those are just two of the ways we put demons before God, but they're not the only ways. Many of us worship sports teams and players the way we we're commanded to worship God alone. Now, these teams and player aren't demons, but neither is the oak tree environmentalists worship. 
 
 And, then there's politics. I am definitely guilty of worshipping some politicians the way I should worship God alone. It's easy to do, because the devil encourages us to do so. Every moment we're entranced by a Trump rally, we're probably not thinking about God. We're substituting Trump for God. Or Trump's enemies, depending on our political bent. 
 
 You get the point. Anytime we worship things God created, we're cheering the devil and moving ourselves away from God. Do it enough, and the road back will look impossibly long. (It's not. God is with us in the desert, but the devil makes us look through the wrong end of the telescope.)
 
 Yet, all of these sins against the first commandment are forms of civil obedience. 
 
 When we blame man-made global warming for things, we're being obedient to the prevailing cultural norms and mores. Same for all the other micro-aggressions against God. They're all forms of civil obedience. We're doing them to look good in the eyes of some faction of society.
