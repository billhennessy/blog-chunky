I call on Governor Parson of Missouri to order a special session of the legislature this Thursday, June 4, to consider a new law that indemnifies citizens from civil or criminal prosecution for the use of lethal force in an attempt to suppress a riot or to protect property or persons during a riot.

Call it the Castle Doctrine for Communities.

I will leave it to the lawyers to determine the correct wording.

We have seen a complete surrender to terrorists, thugs, and violent criminals. Governors, mayors, and police cannot or will not stop the insurrections, looting, mayhem, and murder.

You had your chance. 

You did not lead. 

We will.

As Tucker Carlson said in an epic monologue tonight: Our leaders are weak. The predators know it.

It’s time for the leaders to stand aside and let the people defend their communities, families, neighbors, homes, and businesses. With any force they deem necessary.

It’s time for the Minute Men to march again.
