# How Will Corporate Brands Wiggle Out of BLM?

When Black Lives Matter&trade; and Antifa began their reign of terror in May, many big US corporations announced their undying support for the organizations. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos went so far as to ask customer who do not support BLM to stop being customers of Amazon. 

At the time, nearly 60 percent of Americans supported BLM. But that view has changed. 

In a recent poll, only 39 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of Black Lives Matter, while 47 percent oppose the company. We can't read people's minds, but we can see the factors that may have driven this sharp reversal in public opinion:

* BLM's founders reiterated that they are Marxists and Satanists
* BLM has released videos of its founders conjuring demons for power and knowledge
* BLM has called for the destruction of the nuclear family
* BLM has continued to riot and loot
* BLM has continued to serve as a money-laundering front for the Democratic Party
* BLM has affirmed that it is a racist, segregationist organization

No novelist could produce a more perfect villain than Black Lives Matter&trade;

### America's Consumer Brands Fund BLM&trade;

Why do people demand to know who's funding BLM's riots? We already know. This is a partial list of companies who've proudly announced how much they give to BLM:

| Company | Announced Donations to BLM&trade; |
|:--|--:|
| Amazon | $10,000,000 |
| Google | $12,000,000 |

| Walmart | $100,000,000 |
| Target | $10,000,000 |
| Etsy | $1,000,000 |
| H&M | $500,000 |
| Everlane | $75,000 |

Additionally, McDonald's removed American flags from its stores to show solidarity with BLM. 

In other words, these brands (and many more) are funding a Marxist-Satanist terror group bent on destroying Western Civilization and the Kingdom of God. 

### Can These Brands Survive? 

Yes. All of the brands can probably survive doing business with only 39 percent of the American consumer base. But they can't survive in their current form. They will have to eliminate a lot of jobs, greatly reduce their advertising, and probably end all donations to groups like BLM. They just won't have the money. 

If you own stock in these companies, you should probably get out now. For one, you're profiting from evil. For another, these brands could plummet in value, and soon. Who wants to do business with a company that supports domestic terrorism, rioting, Marxism, and Satanism? Every time you swallow a piece of food from McDonald's, you're inviting demons.
