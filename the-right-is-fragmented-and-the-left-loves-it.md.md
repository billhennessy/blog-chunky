I caught myself. 

Well, not exactly. "Caught myself" implies that I recognized what I was about to do before I did it. But that's wrong. Instead, I recognized what I'd done *after* I'd done it. Like catching a murderer after the fact. The damage was already done. 

The damage wasn't bad, really. In another age, why I did would not be bad at all. It may have even been helpful. But we're in *this* age, not some other age. And in *this* age, "not so bad" isn't good enough. When civilization itself is on the line, every action, every moment, must be directed toward a noble purpose. Everything we do must move the plot forward. Because the plot moves forward one way or the other. We can't stop the plot anymore than we can stop time. And if we're not guiding the plot, the plot will sweep us along like a leaf on a river. Until the water weighs us down and we sink to the bottom, scraping along the rocks and mud and detritis. 

What was my crime? 

In less than 5 minutes, I posted 7 stories to Gab. Stories on 7 different topics. 

What's so bad about that?

It's exactly what the enemy wants us to do. Let me explain.

In 2008, I started working on a book, *Zen Conservatism*. The premise of the book was that the right was far too fragmented. We had too many organizations, too many publications, and far too many "number one issues." (If you have more than one 'number one issue,' you have no number one issue.) 

This fragmentation meant our forces were divided. Or our individual efforts were divided. No matter how much we did, no matter how hard we worked, nothing got done. 

Sure, we made *progress* every day. Tiny, incremental progress. You'd need precision measurement devices only NASA and CERN have access to to measure the amount of progress we made on any one issue. 

What did I do about it? 

I went out and started another organization, another movement. A movement with a whole set of issues to pursue.

In other words, I fragmented the fragments.
