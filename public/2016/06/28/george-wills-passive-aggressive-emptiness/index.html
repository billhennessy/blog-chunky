                            <p>Pat Buchanan and George Will have a lot in common, but they&rsquo;re very different, too. They&rsquo;re both conservative writers and journalists. But Buchanan&rsquo;s an activist while Will is a passivist. (New word?) Let me explain.</p>
<p>When I was a freshman in college, a professor told me he saw George Will speak. He found Will&rsquo;s conservatism &ldquo;intellectual and reasonable,&rdquo; unlike Ronald Regan&rsquo;s &ldquo;extremism.&rdquo; It was a shot at my Reaganism. I knew it.</p>
<p>That was in 1983, and the US economy was in the tank. High unemployment. Sky-high interest rates. And inflation was still painful to millions. The professor heard George Will busily distance himself from Reagan.</p>
<p>By 1984, though, it was morning in America again. And George Will was all in with Reagan.</p>
<p>George Will runs away from conservatives who annoy the academic elite. In 1979, Will worried about Reagan&rsquo;s positions being outside the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; of American voters. He endorsed Howard Baker for president, then George H. W. Bush. Will described Bush as someone so perfect that, as a kid, you&rsquo;d have wanted to punch him for being the kid your mom constantly badgered you to be like. (That was before Bush raised taxes and puked on the Japenese Prime Minister&rsquo;s lap.)</p>
<p>Now, George F. Will is so distraught over Trump&rsquo;s rudeness and plain talk that he has left the Republican party. Will now identifies as &ldquo;unaffiliated,&rdquo; allowing him to use whichever bathroom has the shortest line. How convenient.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that in Will&rsquo;s mind this constitutes action. He thinks he&rsquo;s taking a stand. He believes he&rsquo;s acting all principled and shit. And he probably thinks he&rsquo;s no different than Pat Buchanan.</p>
<p>But there is a difference.</p>
<p>Pat Buchanan left the GOP in 2000, unhappy with the party&rsquo;s nominee and choices. But that&rsquo;s where the similarities end, because Buchanan took positive action toward a defined end goal while George Will&rsquo;s disaffiliation is nothing but slacktivism.</p>
<p>Buchanan quit the Republican Party and joined the Reform Party. He became the Reform Party&rsquo;s nominee for president. He campaigned hard and got some votes. Conservapedia credits Buchanan with George W. Bush&rsquo;s win in Florida.</p>
<p>In short, Buchanan took action and made a personal sacrifice to represent people who felt unrepresented by the GOP and the DNC. Buchanan acted for others, while Will retreated for his own personal comfort. Will&rsquo;s highly touted exit from the GOP is passive and empty, **like a plastic grocery bag blowing in the wind. **</p>
<p>People might nod at George Will&rsquo;s intellectual gravitas, but people marched behind Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p>America doesn&rsquo;t have time for slacktivism.</p>
<p>But America has plenty of time to <a href="https://hennessysview.com/turning-on-trump/">read my new book</a> before the conventions.</p>

                If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever cheated on your spouse just to get back at your daughter for dating or marrying the wrong man, you&amp;rsquo;re probably a #nevertrump person like George Will.
Suppose your daughter married a man you didn&amp;rsquo;t approve of. You would probably respond by cheating on your own spouse, would you not? Having an affair would teach your daughter a lesson, right? And if your spouse and your friends and your other children suffered, too bad.

                The middle of the road is fine until you have to get somewhere.
I voted for Bob Dole in 1996. Yet his nomination drove me away from political activism for years.

I got out of the Navy in the fall of 1994. I watched the GOP reclaim the House with my nephew, Scott. I expected the Republicans to nominate a solid conservative who deliver a knock-out blow to the Clinton era two years later.

                Sometimes I’m ashamed and embarrassed at my roots. See, I graduated from the same Catholic grade school as St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, I know. But how else do I react to stories like this one from George Will.
It seems that Mayor Slay’s administration is busy trampling all over the rights of a citizen, Jim Roos.
Roos painted a sign on a building he owns that days “End Eminent Domain Abuse.
