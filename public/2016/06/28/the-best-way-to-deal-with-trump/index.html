</a>Probably, <strong>you, like me, thought America lost its mind last year when Donald Trump led all the polls in August</strong> and September. You probably, like me, wondered why people would buy this guy&rsquo;s story. And very probably, you, like me, struggled with how to deal with the whole Trump phenomenon. Even if you were onboard with Trump day one, you probably can use some powerful logic to bolster your arguments, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.createspace.com/6282532">CLICK TO ORDER</a></p>
<p>Everyone can, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Bill Hennessy, <strong>co-founder of the St. Louis Tea Party Coalition</strong> and <a href="https://hennessysview.com/books-by-bill-hennessy/">author of five books</a> beginning with <strong><em>The Conservative Manifesto</em> in 1993</strong>. <em>The Conservative Manifesto</em> was a featured alternate selection of the Conservative Book Club twice in 1994. I&rsquo;ve been a guest on Neil Caputo, Glenn Beck, and The Kudlow Report. And I&rsquo;ve been accused of &ldquo;selling out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>**<a href="https://www.createspace.com/6282532"><em>Turning On Trump</em></a> chronicles the sordid tales **of that &ldquo;sell-out.&rdquo; Which wasn&rsquo;t a sell-out at all, but a needed realization of what&rsquo;s most important right now for America&rsquo;s survival. It&rsquo;s the real-time account of a dyed-in-the-wool conservative turning around on Trump. And some people say it&rsquo;s &ldquo;the ultimate political mea culpa.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.createspace.com/6282532">_Turning On Trump _</a>has some very emotional moments that you&rsquo;ll relate to</strong>, too, like the storyline of your favorite movie. I came under heavy fire from friends and family when I began to think differently about Donald Trump. You might have experienced this yourself, didn&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s painful to feel like you&rsquo;re letting people down, and it&rsquo;s terrible to think you can&rsquo;t make them see what you see, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><strong>I pulled together these stories from my blog, <strong><a href="https://hennessysview.com/"><strong>HennessysView.com</strong></a>, to help you see what I saw at the turning. I want to reassure you that, however you feel about Trump, you&rsquo;re right in one way or another. If you can&rsquo;t see yourself voting for Trump yet, it&rsquo;s not your fault. Many in</strong> the ruling class and the media want you to feel that way</strong>, and they&rsquo;re very good at making you feel what they want you to feel. We&rsquo;ve all gone through it one time or another. Those mainstream media folks are effective, even on us, are they not?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leaders adapt principles to circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash;General George S. Patton</p>
<p>**But if you&rsquo;re reading this now, you know you&rsquo;re open to overcoming those feelings that hold you back **from thinking differently. I was there, too. And I&rsquo;m here now with <em>Turning on Trump</em> to make your life better, to align your big principles with the principles that will save our Supreme Court from three to five hard-left replacements favored by Crooked Hillary. (I really, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/05/21/klukowski-trump-scotus-list-conservative-goldmine/">really like Donald Trump&rsquo;s list of Supreme Court nominees</a>, don&rsquo;t you? Even if you&rsquo;re not there yet on Trump, his Heritage Foundation list of appointments is stellar, you probably agree.)</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll <strong>buy and read <a href="https://www.createspace.com/6282532"><em>Turning On Trump</em></a> for fun</strong> and for information. And you might want to buy an extra copy or two to give to friends who just can&rsquo;t see the truth yet. They will. They&rsquo;ll turn around. And you can help by buying them a copy of <em>Turning On Trump</em>. It&rsquo;s the <strong>very best way to deal</strong> with the Trump phenomenon right now.</p>

 The Republican leadership in Congress doesn’t have the guts to go to the floor of the Senate or the floor of the House and make these charges. This is outstanding. You can’t let Hillary Clinton get away with her corruption, her cronyism, her criminality. I don’t care who you support or don’t support. She’s detestable.

                Do you want to know what Trump supporters are thinking? Many people do.
If you supported Ted Cruz, you might not understand how the guy who wrote The Conservative Manifesto in 1993 could support Trump.
If you supported Marco Rubio or Ben Carson last year, how do you reconcile your convictions with Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s bizarre life?
Is Donald Trump a conservative or not?
I&amp;rsquo;ve written a new book about all these things, and you can buy your copy soon.

                Most of my readers asked for a print edition of my new book, Fight to Evolve: The Government&amp;rsquo;s Secret War on NTX.
Great news! Your book is waiting for you on Amazon. It&amp;rsquo;s just $17.99, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to know that I don&amp;rsquo;t get a penny from the sales. All proceeds go to the Coalition for Safer Drinking and its fight to reduce alcohol&amp;rsquo;s negative effects on health.
If you, like me, prefer electronic books, you can get the Kindle version of Fight to Evolve for just $3.
