<h3 id="anti-gay-jihad">Anti-Gay Jihad</h3>
<p>Instead, America&rsquo;s radical left has declared a jihad against gays. Leading this jihad is Imam Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook. Zuckerberg&rsquo;s improvised excommunication device is banishment from his social network. And Zuck aims his weapon at two kinds of gays:</p>
<p>*1. Gays who oppose Islamification of the West.
*2. Gays who support Donald Trump for President.</p>
<p>Here are just a few examples Zuckerberg&rsquo;s anti-gay jihad:</p>
<p>** <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/06/17/facebook-bans-gay-magazine-critical-islam/">Facebook banned Gaystream magazine over an article critical of Islam</a>
** Facebook <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/06/16/facebook-shadowbans-page-mapping-migrant-refugee-crimes/">shadow banned a German page mapping violent crimes committed by Muslim</a> immigrants
** Facebook deleted<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/06/12/facebook-deletes-pamela-gellers-stop-islamization-america-page-orlando-attack/"> Pamela Geller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stop Islamization of America&rdquo; page</a>
** Facebook <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/06/16/long-facebook-take-spot-omar-mateens-terrorist-threat/">scrubbed Orlando Massacre perpetrator&rsquo;s pro-ISIS posts</a>
** Facebook <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/06/17/facebook-shuts-transgender-trump-facebook-page/">deleted Transgender for Trump </a>page
** Facebook <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/06/12/facebook-doubles-bans-pamela-geller-criticizing-islam/">banned Pamela Geller&rsquo;s personal account </a>after deleting her organization page</p>
<p>You probably thought, like me, that the Orlando Massacre would trigger an anti-Islamic terror backlash, but it&rsquo;s pretty obvious the left in America is going after gays instead. Look at all the Democrats and media types who defend violent attacks against Trump supporters, especially gays and Hispanics. Even <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/lgbtrump-gay-men-voting-donald-trump-n594691">NBC admits gay Trump supporters are subject to violent attacks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A number of gay men who have decided to throw their support behind Trump told NBC OUT it has not been an easy road. Juan Hernandez, a gay and Latino member of the Log Cabin Republicans, said his support led to physical violence by anti-Trump protesters at a rally in San Jose. Images of the attack and his bloodied clothes <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/06/10/im-voting-for-donald-trump-so-i-went-to-see-him-speak-protesters-broke-my-nose/">went viral</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/lgbtrump-gay-men-voting-donald-trump-n594691">same NBC story highlights a Marine veteran</a> who&rsquo;s afraid to reveal his last name:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When you put your name out on a national level as supporting someone who attracts that much vitriol and disgust, you&rsquo;re putting yourself up for doxxing &hellip; Especially for someone like me who&rsquo;s considered a &lsquo;traitor,'&rdquo; added Eric, who is a member of LGBTrump, an online network for LGBTQ people who support the GOP presidential hopeful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why hasn&rsquo;t Imam Zuckerberg banned NBC News for reporting this? It&rsquo;s coming, folks, just watch.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the left&rsquo;s outrage over this open war on gays? Huh? Where the hell are they?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve moved on because the Gay Moment has passed.</p>
<h3 id="americas-gay-moment">America&rsquo;s Gay Moment</h3>
<p>This violent anti-gay backlash from the left confirms my 2013 hunch that <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2013/12/21/phil-robertson-duck-dynasty-ae-killed-gay-moment/">America&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gay Moment&rdquo; was ending</a>. For about 40 years, gay was THE cultural moment in America, but all moments end, as <a href="https://observer.com/1997/12/a-gay-moment-but-this-too-shall-pass/">Richard Brookhiser wrote</a> in 1999.</p>
<p>Brookhiser identified <a href="https://observer.com/1997/12/a-gay-moment-but-this-too-shall-pass/">three great moments in 20th century America</a>:</p>
<p>** The Irish Moment (1900 to 1945)
** The Jewish Moment (1946 to 1999)
** The Gay Moment (1971 to about 2014)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://observer.com/1997/12/a-gay-moment-but-this-too-shall-pass/">how Brookhiser identifies Moments</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The form for describing Minority Moments is a two-part phrase. The first element is always plucky . Plucky suggests the minority’s embattled status (but not too embattled, because to enjoy a Moment is to have won). The second element is some quality that is characteristic, in their own and the world’s eyes, of the minority. The Irish were plucky and brave (the Fighting Irish). The Jews were plucky and smart (10,000 intellectuals and comics). Gays are plucky and cool (gays themselves might say plucky and fabulous -and why not? Everyone understands).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when a moment ends, the moment&rsquo;s champions turn against the cause. The people who championed the Irish turned against the Irish. The folks who then championed the Jewish moment turned against the Jews. And now, as <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2013/12/21/phil-robertson-duck-dynasty-ae-killed-gay-moment/">I predicted three years ago</a>, the gay moment has ended and the anti-gay backlash has begun.</p>
<p>Which all reminds me of a story.</p>
<h3 id="the-tea-partys-moment">The Tea Party&rsquo;s Moment</h3>
<p>In 2010, I was sitting in a restaurant at the Grand Ole Opry convention center in Nashville along with about 30 other people attending the National Tea Party Convention. Andrew Breitbart was there, and he made an observation. The 30 or so people sitting at a long, long table represented something of the Tea Party leadership at the time. After dinner, Breitbart took a quick poll of ethnicity and discovered that more half of that Tea Party leadership group was either Irish or Jewish or, in the case of Breitbart, both. (Andrew was raised Jewish by his adoptive parents, but his biological parents were of Irish descent.) What wasn&rsquo;t as well known at the time&ndash;some<a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/06/must-see-jim-hoft-comes-goes-off-takes-gay-leaders-idiotic-attacks-donald-trump/"> of those Tea Party leaders were gay</a>.</p>
<p>Now, people of Irish descent make up about 10 percent of the US population, while Jews account for about 2.6 percent. And gays less than 2 percent. Which means that all three of Great Moments were over-represented in the Tea Party leadership. Grossly over-represented in fact.</p>
<p>You might say the Tea Party got its moxie, its pluck, from the three great cultural &ldquo;moments&rdquo; of the past century. And now, owing in part to the horror at Pulse nightclub, the representatives of those now out-of-favor moments fight for our lives against the left&rsquo;s latest &ldquo;in&rdquo; group.</p>
<p>The new American moment, championed by Zuckerberg, Hillary, and the radical left, is the Muslim Moment. And, unlike the first three moments, this one will end in tears. The only question is: whose tears?</p>
<p>P.S. If you think I&rsquo;ve lost my mind, try reading &ldquo;<a href="https://hennessysview.com/2013/12/21/phil-robertson-duck-dynasty-ae-killed-gay-moment/">How Phil Robertson Ended the Gay Moment</a>.&rdquo; I was even crazier back then.</p>

                You might have noticed that my predictions have been remarkably accurate lately, have you not?
For example, on Sunday, May 1, I predicted Ted Cruz would suspend his campaign after getting trounced in Indiana. Two days later, Cruz lost the Indiana primary to Donald Trump 53 to 36. At the time I wrote, many pundits and pollster still believed Cruz could win that Indiana race, and everyone believed Cruz was telling the truth when he said repeatedly he was staying in the race to Cleveland unless Trump reached 1,237 delegates before then.

                Yes, you can win a contest before it starts.
I gotta tell ya, the people at Fox News are stupid. Dumb. Ignorant. Pliable. Oafish. Any word you want you to use that means cognitively challenged (for the politically correct).
But the Fox Newsmorons have a lot of company at National Review.
Trump is playing these media elites like a fiddle.
When The Donald says &amp;ldquo;dance,&amp;rdquo; they dance. When he says &amp;ldquo;cower,&amp;rdquo; they cower.
