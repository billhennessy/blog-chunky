                            <p>Think about the word &ldquo;news.&rdquo; In a moment, I&rsquo;m going to ask you more questions about the news. Before that, though, you probably heard about the terrible terrorist attack in Istanbul, Turkey. Dozens killed, scores injured. &ldquo;It was like hell,&rdquo; one witness recalled.</p>
<p>Where did you get news of this latest terrorist attack? Facebook? Television? Radio?</p>
<p>Do you remember what you were doing when you heard the news? Take a moment to think back to when you first heard the news. Close your eyes if you think it will help remember and recall.</p>
<p>How did you feel when you heard reports of explosions in the Istanbul airport? Were you surprised? Did you know at the time that Istanbul is in Turkey, or did you think &ldquo;where is Istanbul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did you tell anyone? I did. I read the FoxNews.com headline to a colleague. &ldquo;Multiple explosions reported at Istanbul airport,&rdquo; or something like that.</p>
<p>Do you watch news on television or do you rely on the internet to keep informed? You are reading this blog now. Is this news to you? Or do you think news means CNN or the Wall Street Journal or CBS Radio news? Whatever you think when you think &ldquo;news,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re bound to hear a lot more about terrorism soon.</p>
<p>Sometime today or tomorrow you will likely watch the news again. When you hear more about terrorism, ask yourself, &ldquo;Is it supposed to be this way?&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t you wish when you hear about terrorism and terrorists it would be the last time?</p>
<p>Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton say that ISIS is almost defeated. They say there&rsquo;s less terrorism today. So why do you hear about so many new terrorist attacks? Could it be that Obama and Clinton lie to you?</p>
<p>You should keep track of how much people talk about terrorism on the news. The news people are mostly Democrats&ndash;over 90 percent of people in the news business. So you&rsquo;d expect them to say what Obama and Clinton want them to tell you. And the news still talks about terrorism, terrorists, and terror attacks, don&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Maybe terrorism is getting worse, not better. Maybe ISIS is getting stronger, not weaker. Maybe your kids are less safe today than they were eight years ago.</p>
<p>You might find yourself hearing &ldquo;terror&rdquo; and thinking about terrorism more and more. If you do, ask yourself this: who made it so bad? The people who&rsquo;ve been running the government for 8 years, or the guy who runs buildings and golf courses?</p>
<p>The more you hear &ldquo;terror,&rdquo; the more you like Donald Trump. And the more you like Donald Trump, the less you fear terrorism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy now, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>If you really want to feel safe from terrorism, <a href="https://hennessysview.com/turning-on-trump/">try reading my new book</a>. It&rsquo;s bullet-proof.</p>

                I am embarrassed.
I am embarrassed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about this problem sooner. Or I heard about it and ignored it, which is even worse. Maybe I thought it was just the usual liberal whining about trumped up racial problems. Whatever, I should have listened.
On September 2, I asked a room of about 30 tea partiers, &amp;ldquo;Do you trust our justice system?&amp;rdquo; I heard a chorus of &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo;

                At the Pachyderm Club’s national convention last year, I overheard a Republican Missouri State Representative talking about HB 609. “It was the best bill I’ve ever been involved with,” she said. “Those people who just went nuts don’t know anything about insurance.”

If you read my blog, you’re likely one of the “those people,” the ignorant masses who don’t understand the fineries of the legislative process. You don’t appreciate how hard the insurance industry lobbyists worked with Jefferson City to craft a law that sold only a bit of you into slavery while ensuring the insurance companies remained profitable and your favorite Republican legislators had the money to campaign next year.

                The next St. Louis County Executive better brace himself for this: poverty is exploding in the county.
I&amp;rsquo;m not saying poor people do bad things. I&amp;rsquo;m saying that, at some point, eliminating jobs and hope will drive people to take things. And they will take things by force. And they will show no mercy to anyone who tries to get in their way.
Right or wrong, it happens. And no militarized police force will stop it.
