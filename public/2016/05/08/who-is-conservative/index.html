<p>So why do people see Trump as far to the left of Reagan?</p>
<p><strong>Contrasts and comparisons.</strong></p>
<p>Reagan ran against George Bush and John B. Anderson. Also-rans included Howard Baker and Phil Crane, John Connally, Harold Stassen, Bob Dole, Larry Pressler, and Lowell Weicker. That made Reagan the most conservative Republican by a wide margin. George H. W. Bush was an eastern seaboard Rockefeller Republican in 1979 and 1980. Bush didn&rsquo;t became a conservative until after he became Reagan&rsquo;s VP. John B. Anderson never became a conservative. **Anderson ran as an independent to try to throw the election to Jimmy Carter. **Bill Kristol is a lot like John Anderson. And in four years, Kristol will be forgotten just like Anderson.</p>
<p>[Tweet &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s positions are almost identical to Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s. &ldquo;]</p>
<p><strong>Conservative is relative</strong>. I know conservatives tend to believe there&rsquo;s no such thing as relativity, but they&rsquo;re wrong about that. Conservatism is relative. I won&rsquo;t bother with defining left-right or liberal-conservative or any other dimensions of political thought. They&rsquo;re meaningless. But I will point out that all of the definitions I&rsquo;ve seen are relative. A position is conservative or liberal only relative to other positions.</p>
<p><strong>Nowhere does the constitution mention &ldquo;conservatism.&quot;</strong> And the modern concept of conservatism didn&rsquo;t really exist at the time of our founding. <strong>America&rsquo;s founders were pretty much all radical liberals</strong> for their time. They believed in liberty, and they were willing to overthrow their government to get it. That&rsquo;s very radical and very liberal.</p>
<p>I think modern conservatism seeks to conserve classical liberalism. But that&rsquo;s just my opinion. You are entitled to be as mistaken as me.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s play pretend for a moment that there is a conservative absolute. If there were, Ronald Reagan would be the only absolute conservative president in the lifetimes of anyone now alive, would he not? Everyone agrees.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see how Trump compares to Reagan on some key issues and themes, okay?</p>
<p>[table caption=&quot;Trump vs. Reagan&rdquo; colwidth=&quot;20%|40%|40%&rdquo;  colalign=&quot;center|left|left&rdquo;]
Issue,Trump,Reagan
Theme,Make America Great Again,Let&rsquo;s Make America Great Again
Trade, 45% tariff on unfair imports from China, 100% tariff on Japanese semi-conductors, 45% tariff on Japanese motorcycles
Abortion, Opposes abortion except cases of rape, incest, or life of mother, Opposed abortion except to save the life of the mother</p>
<p>Social Security, Committed to preserving Social Security, eliminate fraud and waste, increase efficiency, &ldquo;&hellip;ironclad commitment to Social Security&rdquo;, signed 1983 bill and encouraged every Republican to read it. &ldquo;To be sure, we must reform it, root out the fraud, make it more efficient, and ensure that the program is solvent.&rdquo;
Taxes, Cut taxes, overhaul tax code, flatten brackets, 25% tax cut early, then overhaul tax system &amp; reduce rates
Defense, Build a military so powerful no one will dare bother us, avoid nation-building and open-ended wars of intervention, Rebuilt the military and launched SSD to break the Soviet Union without a war</p>
<p>Illegal Immigration, Build a wall, deport illegal aliens, <a href="https://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Ronald_Reagan_Immigration.htm">Granted amnesty to illegal aliens and reform immigration laws</a>
[/table]</p>
<p>Those are not the only issues, but they&rsquo;re some of the leading issues of both Reagan and Trump. On some issues, Trump is slightly to Reagan&rsquo;s left. On other issues, like illegal immigration, Trump is somewhat to Reagan&rsquo;s right. Overall, there&rsquo;s little difference between Reagan and Trump on many key issues.</p>
<p>Why does it feel like Trump is so far to Reagan&rsquo;s left? <strong>Because <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/am-i-right/201307/your-memory-isnt-what-you-think-it-is">memories are fluid</a>.</strong> Memories are not fixed. They change over time.</p>
<p>When Reagan took office, we had very few conservative think tanks, few conservative magazines, and a handful of conservative pundits. Since then, conservatism has bloomed into an industry, Conservative, Inc. Tens of thousands of people make their living being conservative. That&rsquo;s something new. And it&rsquo;s made conservatism kind of weird. In fact, Conservative, Inc., has done for conservatism what the Civil Rights Industry has done for African-Americans.  That&rsquo;s not a compliment to either corporation. Have you looked at African-American unemployment lately?</p>
<p>Plus, the internet came along after Reagan. The internet lets us all hide inside affinity bubbles&ndash;safe spaces where we can hide away from any ideas that we don&rsquo;t agree with. <strong>In these affinity bubbles, we morph our memories to fit a narrative.</strong> We&rsquo;ve made Reagan more &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; than he was. We&rsquo;ve created Reagan in our own image and likeness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why so many Cruz fans lost their minds when Phyllis Schlafly endorsed Trump. A lot of Cruz supporters remember the Reagan years differently than they actually happened. That&rsquo;s just the way the brain works.</p>
<p><strong>I believe the Constitution, though flawed, provides the best government ever conceived for human flourishing</strong>. And I believe the best hope for Constitutional government lies in understanding how things really are and <strong>dealing with reality on reality&rsquo;s terms.</strong> That&rsquo;s why <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2016/05/06/trump-for-president-i-endorse/">I formally endorsed Donald J. Trump for President</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you can&rsquo;t vote for Trump because he&rsquo;s too liberal, you probably couldn&rsquo;t have voted for Reagan, either.</strong> You just don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re thinking about voting for Hillary or working against Trump, <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2016/05/04/an-affair-to-dismember/">you&rsquo;d probably cheat on your wife to punish your daughter for marrying a guy you don&rsquo;t like</a>.</p>

I am a terrible father, a crappy husband (ask my ex-wives), and a difficult employee. I do a lot of things poorly. Most things, in fact. Especially the things I &amp;ldquo;have&amp;rdquo; to do. Authority irritates me.
While I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at following plans, I write a week&amp;rsquo;s worth of blogs on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The pattern keeps me sane. Or semi-sane. I supplement those when events warrant.

                I have no idea who will win the Indiana primary 72 hours from the time I write. But the people inside Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s campaign seem to have an idea. And it&amp;rsquo;s not good for them. Cruz&amp;rsquo;s top team expects their candidate to lose. And Senator Cruz seems to have accepted that outcome.
Expectations Matter More Than Preferences Regular readers know that polls that ask &amp;ldquo;who do you think will win&amp;rdquo; trump polls that ask &amp;ldquo;who do you intend to vote for&amp;rdquo; or even &amp;ldquo;who did you vote for?

                I was a pretender.
In 2012, I pretended I believed Mitt Romney would win. But I knew better. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the heart to tell the truth to the volunteers banging doors and working call lists from our election office in South County.
But I knew Romney would lose. I suspected the GOP would not regain the Senate.
When some of our hardest workers showed up to help break down the office and move our belongings, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t look at them.
