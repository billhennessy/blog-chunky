                            <p>I&rsquo;ll make this short. I have been highly critical of <strong>Senator Roy Blunt</strong> for a long time. You can search my blog and find many things that bother me about the Blunts, but that&rsquo;s not what this is about.</p>
<p>This post is about <strong>whether the US Constitution survives</strong>.</p>
<p>This post is about <strong>whether that government of the people, by the people, and for the people will perish from the earth</strong>.</p>
<p>This post is about** saving the damn country,** and <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2014/03/15/talk-politician/">I won&rsquo;t let my positions stand before that overriding great interest</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-supreme-court-and-survival-of-the-constitution">The Supreme Court and Survival of the Constitution</h3>
<p>Antonin Scalia is dead. At best, the Supreme Court is split 4-4. The person who replaces Scalia will tip the balance one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>If the balance tips toward the left, our future will become very dim</strong>. A 5-4 leftist majority will literally rule the Constitution out of existence. That court would find new &ldquo;rights&rdquo; that enslave people. (The right to healthcare means people can be impressed into service as a doctor or nurse. A right to education means people can be forced against their will to teach.)</p>
<p><strong>That leftist majority would discover amazing new limits on freedom of speech and assembly</strong>. It will find tight restrictions on Christianity and Judaism.</p>
<p><strong>That leftist majority would find a new meaning for the 2nd Amendment.</strong> This new meaning will give governments the power to enter your home and seize your weapons. Because that&rsquo;s the power government wants.</p>
<h3 id="justice-mike-lee">Justice Mike Lee</h3>
<p>Like Ted Cruz, <strong>I want to see Senator Mike Lee in that seat</strong>. Mike Lee or someone like him. Yesterday, Trump added Senator Lee to his proposed list of <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/23/donald-trump-expands-supreme-court-justice-list-includes-mike-lee/">Supreme Court nominees, as reported by Breitbart</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), who currently serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee and clerked for Justice Samuel Alito, is one of the newly added names.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In May, Trump <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-releases-list-of-names-of-potential-united-states-supreme-c">released</a> a list of possible justices he would use to fill the current vacancy due to Justice Scalia’s death in February.</p>
<p>The initial list was described by Breitbart News legal editor <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/05/21/klukowski-trump-scotus-list-conservative-goldmine/">Ken Klukowski</a> as a “conservative goldmine.”</p>
<p>Later that day,<a href="https://hennessysview.com/2016/09/24/nevertrump-self-immolation-over-trusty-ted-cruz/"> Senator Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump</a>. In his endorsement, Cruz cited Mike Lee&rsquo;s possible SCOTUS appointment as a key reason for supporting Trump:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For some time, I have been seeking greater specificity on this issue, and today the Trump campaign provided that, releasing a very strong list of potential Supreme Court nominees — including Sen. <strong>Mike Lee, who would make an extraordinary justice — and making an explicit commitment to nominate only from that list.</strong> This commitment matters, and it provides a serious reason for voters to choose to support Trump.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two things must happen for Justice Lee to become a reality:</p>
<p>*1. Trump must win.
*2. Republicans must retain the Senate.</p>
<h3 id="i-endorse-roy-blunt">I Endorse Roy Blunt</h3>
<p>So <strong>I am voting for Senator Blunt</strong>, and I pray you do, too. I&rsquo;m voting for Blunt for the same reasons Ted Cruz is voting for Donald Trump. If Trump wins, he can&rsquo;t do any good, including choosing a Supreme Court nominee, without a strong Senate majority. If Trump doesn&rsquo;t win, we&rsquo;ll need the strongest possible Republican Senate. Either way, it has to be Blunt.</p>
<p>I am not going to argue with anyone about Blunt&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses. Blunt&rsquo;s <strong>Heritage Action score</strong> might dip into the 50s, but his opponent&rsquo;s score would never rise above zero.  I&rsquo;m looking at the lay of the land and, as General Patton, <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2016/09/24/nevertrump-self-immolation-over-trusty-ted-cruz/">adapting principles to circumstances</a>.</p>

                You might be wondering why the Missouri Farm Bureau endorsed Democrat Chris Koster instead of Republican Eric Greitens. The Farm Bureau endorses Republicans about 99% of the time.
If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking it had to do with policy or personality, you&amp;rsquo;re thinking wrong. (And, no, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t because of Koster&amp;rsquo;s hair, Mark Reardon.) This was all about the establishment vs. the people. It&amp;rsquo;s about power and control. Greitens threatens the establishment.

That was the Boston Tea Party.
Look at us now! People furious with me for going after Senator Roy Blunt. I went after him because he announced he will vote for cloture knowing full well that cloture give Harry Reid his only chance to strip the House&amp;rsquo;s Obamacare defund language from the continuing resolution.

                Some St. Louis area conservatives cheered Roy Blunt’s (R-MO) elevation to the Number 5 leadership position in the Senate Republican caucus.

I didn’t. At least not politically. I like Senator Blunt personally, so I’m happy in that respect. But I’m not happy for the reasons some others are.
First, as I told Jo Mannies of the St. Louis Beacon, internal party stuff isn’t really a Tea Party matter. Leadership in the Senate’s GOP caucus is for Republican Senators to worry about.
