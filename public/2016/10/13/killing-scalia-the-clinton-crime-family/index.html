<h3 id="something-unrelated">Something Unrelated</h3>
<p>At the end of our talk, the reporter said, &ldquo;do you mind if I ask you about something else? It has nothing to do with my article, and I won&rsquo;t write about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, sure,&rdquo; I said. I was a little apprehensive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2016/10/02/killing-ron-brown/">the Clinton&rsquo;s killed Ron Brown</a>?&rdquo; the reporter asked.</p>
<p><em>Here we go</em>, I thought. <em>I&rsquo;m going to  get called a conspiracy whack job</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I do know reporters who have looked into the case and no longer call the idea crazy. Even some skeptics trying to debunk the assassination story have come away uncertain. And I’m sort of a libertarian. I really don&rsquo;t trust the government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust the Clintons,&rdquo; the reporter said. “I covered them back in the early nineties in Arkansas. During the campaign in ninety-two. And in Washington some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We talked a little more. The reporter knew Ron Brown and liked him. &ldquo;He told you the truth.&rdquo; And she knows the Clintons. They are not like Ron Brown. The Clintons are mean people. And they lie to reporters. They lie to everybody.</p>
<p>[<a href="https://hennessysview.com/2016/10/02/killing-ron-brown/">Read more about the assassination of Ron Brown here</a>]</p>
<h3 id="conspiracy-theory">Conspiracy Theory</h3>
<p>I expected to be called a conspiracy theorist when I posted the Ron Brown story. Instead, I&rsquo;ve received only worried acknowledgments that the Clintons are capable of anything, including assassination.</p>
<p>The reporter is a veteran, serious, established journalist. You&rsquo;d know her name if I told you. Like all good reporters, she&rsquo;s skeptical and meticulous. She checks things out.</p>
<p>And like everyone who&rsquo;s checked into the Ron Brown assassination, she&rsquo;s not sure. She doesn&rsquo;t believe it was an accident, but she can&rsquo;t prove it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<h3 id="scalia-wet-work">Scalia Wet Work</h3>
<p>Then today we learned that Hillary associates John Podesta and Steve Elmendorf exchanged<a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/wikileaks-uncover-murder-plot-podesta-documents-suggest-scalia-assassination/"> emails that appeared to reference an assassination </a>the day before Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was found dead with a pillow over his head at a remote lodge.</p>
<p><img src="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screenshot-2016-10-13-20.16.39.png" alt="screenshot-2016-10-13-20-16-39"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Wet works&rdquo; is spy-talk for &ldquo;assassination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scalia died in a lodge owned by a well-connected Democrat. Alex Newman wrote in The New American, February 16, 2016:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suspicions and unanswered questions surrounding the <a href="https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/item/22544-justice-antonin-scalia-found-dead-at-a-west-texas-ranch">surprise weekend death</a> of pro-Constitution U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia are swirling around the Internet and beyond. Many of the concerns center on the fact that the man who found Scalia&rsquo;s body, <strong>businessman and Democrat donor John Poindexter,</strong> said the late justice was discovered with “a pillow over his head.” Also sparking alarm among some commentators and suspicious citizens are reports and official statements indicating that no autopsy will be conducted, despite contradictory claims surrounding the cause of death. Even the establishment press, apparently unfamiliar with the definition of the term “conspiracy theory,” has started reporting on the concerns and questions, albeit generally with a dismissive tone. <strong>Cries for an autopsy and congressional probe are growing louder</strong>, too, even as the White House, Democrats, and leftists waste no time in plotting to name a successor and tip the balance of power. The atmosphere is getting very tense.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="suspicious-death">Suspicious Death</h3>
<p>You probably remember that a lot of suspicions surrounded Scalia&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>** He showed no signs of health problems at dinner the night before
** He went to be at 9:00 p.m.
** According to Democrat John Poindexter, owner of the lodge where Scalia died, Scalia &ldquo;refused&rdquo; a security detail for the night
** John Poindexter discovered Scalia&rsquo;s body the next morning
** Scalia was dressed with a pillow over his head
** Scalia&rsquo;s bed looked unused, as if he took a nap on top of the blankets
** But he had a pillow over his head
** And there was no autopsy</p>
<p>The government refused to allow an autopsy on Ron Brown&rsquo;s body, too, after a US Marshall determined cause of death over the phone, via <a href="https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/22555-scalia-death-with-pillow-over-his-head-sparks-suspicion">The New American</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another top media personality asking questions was Michael Savage, among the top five most influential and most widely listened to talk-radio hosts in America. “Was [Scalia] murdered?” Savage asked during his program. “We need a Warren Commission-like federal investigation&hellip;. This is serious business.” He also called for an immediate autopsy, according to media reports. In a follow-up post on his website, Savage also wondered how the left would react if anti-U.S. Constitution zealot Ruth Bader Ginsburg died under similar circumstances with a pillow on her face in the final year of a Republican administration at a property owned by a mega-donor for the GOP. And in an interview with Savage on Tuesday, leading GOP presidential contender Donald Trump, when asked whether the candidate would support a Warren Commission-style probe, noted that &ldquo;they found a pillow on his face, which is a pretty unusual place to find a pillow.” Trump did not say whether he would support a commission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“There was no medical examiner present. There was no one who declared the death who was there. It was done by telephone from a U.S. Marshal appointed by Obama himself,” Savage said, outlining some of the many reasons why suspicion, whether warranted or not, is spreading like wildfire across America. “The question is, is it a conspiracy theory to ask questions that are so obviously in need of answer, or is it just common sense. And where is the common sense both in the press and the Republican Party. The answer is nowhere.” Of course, questions, by definition, cannot be a “conspiracy theory, despite the establishment media&rsquo;s misuse of the term.</p>
<p>It looked in February like Scalia was assassinated, and it looks now like Team Hillary conducted the murder. Why else would &ldquo;wet work&rdquo; make Hillary Dems &ldquo;buckle up and double down?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="the-clinton-body-count">The Clinton Body Count</h3>
<p>The more you read about the Clinton body count, the more you believe it&rsquo;s possible that the Clintons have ordered the assassinations of many, many people. Not just enemies, but people with information. People in the way.</p>
<p>Scalia was in the way. Now he&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Call me crazy, but that conversation with a veteran reporter tells me the Clintons are capable of anything, including assassinations. And I think they could have killed Scalia.</p>

                People in the media and the GOP are acting like they learned something on Friday. That&amp;rsquo;s when the Washington Post released an audio (later conjoined with video) of Donald Trump talking lewd about his exploits with women.
I say media people and Republicans are &amp;ldquo;acting&amp;rdquo; like they learned something, because they didn&amp;rsquo;t. We didn&amp;rsquo;t. Everybody who&amp;rsquo;s paid attention to the race (or pop culture) already knew how Trump is. Everybody knows Trump brags about his sexual prowess and how women melt around him.

Mrs. Wagner seems to believe that being a woman gives her some unique moral vantage point. She forgets that she&amp;rsquo;s not the only woman in America.

                Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s Access Hollywood audio has a lot of people cringing. Especially a lot of men who remember the things they&amp;rsquo;ve said about women around other men.

I won&amp;rsquo;t bore you with the biology of it all, but you probably realize that men and women are fundamentally different. Especially when it comes to reproductive success.
