<p><strong>Hillary Clinton told us Trump won the debate with her final answer</strong>. Final answer.</p>
<p>An audience member asked the closing question. He challenged the candidates to say something nice about their opponents. Hillary went first.</p>
<p><strong>The right way to answer those screwball questions is to say something nice and sit down</strong>. I&rsquo;ll explain why in a moment.</p>
<p>Hillary began by talking briefly about Donald Trump&rsquo;s great kids. She got that part right.</p>
<p>But then Hillary went on the attack about negative campaigning. She talked for over two minutes, beyond her allotted time. This time, though, I don&rsquo;t think Trump minded.</p>
<p>When Trump&rsquo;s turn came, he nailed it. He called his opponent &ldquo;a fighter,&rdquo; and he piled on about her refusal to give up.</p>
<p>We all know Trump respects the hell out of fighters. His compliment was sincere as they get.</p>
<p>And then Trump sat down.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why Hillary&rsquo;s answer was so bad and **why she knew she lost. **</p>
<p>When a voter asks a softball question, people want and expect a softball answer. We all wanted to feel good about something. We all know this race is nasty. <strong>We wanted a tiny respite from that nastiness. But Hillary just reminded us</strong>. She turned a softball question into an ugly answer. Because she had to try something.</p>
<p><strong>Trump knew he&rsquo;d won</strong>. He didn&rsquo;t need to land a punch after the bell. He knew it, and he went to his corner. Like a champion. Like a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>Hillary knew she&rsquo;d lost.</strong> She needed to try something to even the score, so she took a chance with a cheap shot after the bell, over the ref&rsquo;s shoulder. She was cheap and ugly. And her gambit failed.</p>
<p>B<strong>y hitting after the bell, Hillary told us all she lost</strong>. **She telegraphed the outcome. **</p>
<p>Trump is back on top. Watch him rise. <a href="https://blog.dilbert.com/post/151599421561/quick-debate-reactions-from-switzerland">Greatest 3rd Act ever</a>.</p>

                Frank Luntz—no fan of Donald J. Trump—said it best: he came into the second debate believing the race was over, but he came out believing Trump is back in the race.
I realize CNN bought a poll that said Clinton won the debate. But CNN has a history of lying, cheating, and hiding facts. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bet a wooden nickel on anything I heard on CNN.
I watched most of the debate at a bar in South St.

                Try not to imagine the worldwide television audience for the Trump vs. Sanders debate. Super Bowl ratings would look skimpy by comparison. Trump vs. Sanders would be the most watched political event ever. And I&amp;rsquo;m including the future in &amp;ldquo;ever.&amp;rdquo; And a Trump vs. Sanders debate would effectively kill Democrats&amp;rsquo; chances in November. This is huge.
Yesterday, I wrote about Trump&amp;rsquo;s remarkable honesty at his press conference, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the big story of the day.

                You might have noticed that my predictions have been remarkably accurate lately, have you not?
For example, on Sunday, May 1, I predicted Ted Cruz would suspend his campaign after getting trounced in Indiana. Two days later, Cruz lost the Indiana primary to Donald Trump 53 to 36. At the time I wrote, many pundits and pollster still believed Cruz could win that Indiana race, and everyone believed Cruz was telling the truth when he said repeatedly he was staying in the race to Cleveland unless Trump reached 1,237 delegates before then.
