<p>Since its revelation in WikiLeaks two weeks ago, Donna Brazile has been justly excoriated for cheating on behalf of Hillary Clinton by passing along a debate question.</p>
<p>However, an important aspect to this story has been overlooked. As the saying goes, it takes two to tango. Yes, Donna Brazile sent a critically beneficial piece of information - <strong>but Hillary Clinton accepted it</strong>.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clinton accepted it (<em><strong>stealing</strong></em>), used it (<em><strong>cheating</strong></em>), and said nothing (<em><strong>lying</strong></em>). Then, when that moment came, she delivered her perfectly prepared answer to an eager audience in the midst of a hotly contested primary election debate (<em><strong>rigging</strong></em>).</p>
<p>An honest candidate would have immediately refused Ms. Brazile&rsquo;s illicit offering; perhaps quietly, but certainly firmly.</p>
<p>An honest candidate could have even grandstanded on stage at the debate and said, &ldquo;Mr. Martin, I cannot in good conscience answer your question, because somehow, I was made aware that you would be asking me that, and so I have an unfair advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heck, an honest candidate could have even shared the question with her opponent prior to the debate in order even the playing field.</p>
<p>But none of those things happened.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, when the revelation of Donna Brazile&rsquo;s betrayal of democratic principles first came to light, instead of confessing to her wrongdoing and resigning with at least a shred of dignity, she blamed the Russians. It was hard to watch.</p>
<p>And by the way, what did her employers do? Neither the Democratic Party nor CNN did anything. They stood silent - which speaks volumes to their character and trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Today, WikiLeaks fulfilled their promise with the publication of a second wave of Donna Brazile&rsquo;s corruption in sneaking debate questions to Team Hillary. CNN did what they should have done then, and severed all ties. But the Democrat Party hasn&rsquo;t (as of this writing).</p>
<p>The friend and allies of Team Hillary <em>- aka the Media -</em> will want to make this story all about &ldquo;The Dishonesty of Donna Brazile.&rdquo; But understand that is a distraction.</p>
<p>The villain of this story isn&rsquo;t Donna Brazile, the sidekick wannabe who offered stolen information. It is Hillary Clinton, the corrupt candidate who repeatedly took the illicit offering, used it, and said nothing.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that once again, Hillary Clinton is empirically proven to be a patently dishonest person who steals, cheats, lies, and rigs. And there is nothing - not a damn thing - that indicates her behavior will change any time soon. Why should it? Up until now, her corruption has consistently been lavishly rewarded by the corporate and political elitists in power.</p>
<p>Americans have had a bellyful of this elitist corruption. On November 8, we will begin in earnest to #DrainTheSwamp.</p>

                You never expect a candidate&amp;rsquo;s surrogates to tell you their candidate is a crook. But that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what Hillary&amp;rsquo;s surrogates are telling you now.
From Bill Richardson to Robby Mook, Clinton surrogates are reciting a strange and disturbing talking point: Voters have &amp;ldquo;baked in&amp;rdquo; Clinton&amp;rsquo;s life of crime.
[FLASHBACK: I gave James Comey the benefit of the doubt in July]
The talking point seems meant to keep Democrats from panicking over the FBI&amp;rsquo;s re-opened criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.

                Everyone knows that the White House is interfering with the FBI&amp;rsquo;s investigation of Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s criminal conspiracies. We know this because the Justice Department is stonewalling the FBI&amp;rsquo;s request for a warrant to search the hard drive Huma Abedin shared with her ex-husband Anthony Weiner.
For those of us too young to remember those black-and-white days of Watergate, here&amp;rsquo;s a brief timeline via Watergate.info:

Hillary personally ordered violent protesters to disrupt Trump events.
Hillary, Brazile, and PACS broke the law by colluding on disrupting Trump events.
Hillary Clinton trashed and intimidated the women her husband raped.
Hillary Clinton stole classified material and her minions offered bribes the FBI to help cover up the crimes.
