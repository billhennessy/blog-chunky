<p>You might find yourself wondering why the <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2016/12/11/is-the-cia-plotting-a-coup/">CIA would plot a coup against Trump and his supporters.</a> If you haven&rsquo;t wondered about a CIA coup, you should.** Focus your awareness for a moment on what Trump means to the people of <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-09-24/forget-new-world-order-heres-who-really-runs-world">the Deep State</a>.**</p>
<p>The Deep State involves those people and institutions that have insulated themselves from the consequences of elections. I&rsquo;m not sure the CIA is actually part of the Deep State, but career intelligence people hang around with Deep State actors. Big banks, military systems producers, George Soros, and Warren Buffett are Deep State actors. So are Lockheed-Martin and Boeing. Rather than some wild theory, Deep State actors simply work to insulate themselves from risk. Political elections represent a risk to many, but not to them.</p>
<p>[For more on the <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/12/virgil-the-deep-state-vs-donald-trump/">Deep State vs. Donald Trump, see Breitbart</a>.]</p>
<p>At least, not usually. Donald Trump&rsquo;s election is different. <strong>Donald Trump and the people who support him threaten the Deep State</strong>. The only way I can think to explain the threat Trump represents to the Deep State is the ancient Roman gladiators.</p>
<p>Gladiators fought for their lives in circuses. Romans considered this entertainment. Like football. The game was a life-or-death struggle against other gladiators or against wild animals.</p>
<p>The Romans who attended these spectacles probably bet on the outcome of the matches. Some of these bets were huge, but the bettors had complete control of their own wagering. No matter what the gladiators did on the field, the betting games went on. (You can bet the mainstream media of the day reported on the bets, not the outcome of the deathmatches. The lives of the gladiators didn&rsquo;t matter. Only the lives of the bettors.)</p>
<p><strong>Think of the gladiators as Trump supporters</strong>. The big bettors at the Colosseum are Deep State actors. The bettors treated the gladiators like toys. Roman soldiers forced the gladiators into the pits. The Romans created a myth for slaves: being a gladiator was something to aspire to. Many slaves believed the myth and strove to become gladiators. To amuse the Romans. And toward the end of the Empire, the myths grewÂ to attract free men and free women (yes, <a href="https://www.history.com/news/history-lists/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-roman-gladiators">there were female gladiators</a>) who signed contracts to fight. Gladiators even became sex symbols, reinforcing the myths.</p>
<p><strong>Imagine how Rome&rsquo;s Deep State would have reacted to a Roman who exposed the gladiatorial myth?</strong> What if a Roman spoke directly to the slaves and the free gladiators, in the language they understood, and told them, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re killing yourselves for no reason. You have a right to live your own life.&rdquo; Imagine how swiftly and brutally the Caesar would Â have smitten that blasphemer!</p>
<p>And what is Trump?</p>
<p>**Trump is a guy who aroused the modern gladiators and slaves, working men and women who&rsquo;ve lived as slaves and gladiators for the Deep State&rsquo;s amusement.Â **Intentionally or not, Trump has opened many eyes to the obvious fact that most Americans live a slave&rsquo;s life: slave to the Deep State actors. We voted for Trump because we were sick of being slaves.</p>
<p>And <strong>the Deep State won&rsquo;t stand for that</strong>. The Romans wouldn&rsquo;t let their slaves abandon the gladiator fights. The Romans wouldn&rsquo;t free slaves to pursue their own lives.</p>
<p>In a desperate and frightening show of shadowy force,** the CIA, and big media have conjured up an excuse to deny Trump the White House**. Their weapon is a fake news story, first in the Washington Post, then the New York Times, now . . . everywhere. The story, the narrative, goes like this: The CIA has proof that Russia manipulated the US election to put Trump into power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complete lie, of course, but complete lies are more believable than little lies. And it seems to be working.</p>
<p><strong>The manipulation of the Electoral College is going smoothly</strong>. Democrat electors are demanding an intel brief by the CIA. John McCain and Lindsay Graham (spelling intentional) have called for investigations. The White House is now saying, flat out, that Russia stole the election for Trump.</p>
<p>Right now,** America&rsquo;s slaves and gladiators are in a fight we didn&rsquo;t expect.** That means the Deep State got the drop on us. But there are more of us than there are of them. The Deep State has to ask itself this: are the slaves and gladiators a greater threat with or without Trump as their leader? (<a href="https://usdefensewatch.com/2016/11/fear-and-loathing-inside-the-deep-state/">The Deep State has been attacking Michael Flynn for more than a year</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>With Trump in office, we have hope and patience.</strong> If the Deep State steals the election, we are free to do what must be done.</p>
<p>The Deep State has been exposed. It will unwind, one way or the other. The Trump way looks pretty safe and controlled. The other way looks like hell on earth.</p>
<p>P.S. Nothing in this post should be interpreted as a threat or as a call for violence. These are simply my observations of the situation and my expectation of reactions should various scenarios unfold. But you can&rsquo;t say you weren&rsquo;t warned.</p>

                Many powerful interests around the world loathe Donald Trump and the people who elected him. There&amp;rsquo;s no disputing that.
One of those powerful interests is the Central Intelligence Agency. One of the CIA&amp;rsquo;s own, Evan McMullin, attempted to disrupt the election. Like Bay of Pigs and Saddam&amp;rsquo;s weapons of mass destruction, that CIA plot failed. Even George Will admits the CIA makes some horrible, deadly mistakes. And sometimes those mistakes come from seeing the results they want to see, not the results presented.

                The fog of war is lifting from Benghazi, and what lies beneath should shame Obamaâs most ardent supporters. Barack Obama choked, and Americans died.

When America came under attack, Obama panicked and froze.
When Americans under his direction pleaded for their lives, he was afraid to pull the trigger.
Hereâs the emerging picture.
White House Ordered Military and CIA to Stand Down and Let Al Qaeda Kill Former Navy SEALs Ty Woods and Glen Doherty, so disgusted by the White Houseâs refusal to help Americans under attack, defied an order to stand down.

                Hey, one of our favorite members of Congress, and a true gentleman, Todd Akin (R-MO), has made the front page of BigGovernment.com.
The Obama Justice Department is quietly investigating the lawyers associated with the John Adams Project who may have violated a number of laws in place to protect our covert operatives and their families. But so far, with few exceptions, the media and their friends on Capitol Hill havenât found this case nearly as interesting as Valerie Plame.
