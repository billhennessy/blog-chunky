<p>Things just got weirder in Missouri. After the stunning revelation that people associated with John Brunner&rsquo;s campaign did, in fact, produce a false, negative video attacking Eric Greitens, you might be wondering what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>First, in case you missed it, Eric Greitens exposed Brunner&rsquo;s deceptions at a recent debate. Watch:</p>
<p>After months of denying any involvement in the video, Brunner&rsquo;s only response was a lame intra-military joke. Brunner&rsquo;s later attempts to deny Greitens&rsquo;s charge seemed coached and desperate.</p>
<p>Now, recall that my <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2016/05/13/how-to-predict-trumps-landslide-win/">predictive skills have been very sharp</a> of late as I try to unravel this amazing story of political charades. It&rsquo;s like a great old movie.</p>
<p>As I pointed out last year, <strong>John Brunner was never supposed to win the nomination</strong>. It seems clear that the smirking political class used John Brunner and his money to try to damage Eric Greitens, as<a href="https://hennessysview.com/2015/07/18/can-john-brunners-consultant-do-his-duty/"> I reported July 18, 2015</a>, by attacking Greitens and splitting the outsider/conservative vote.</p>
<p>Now it seems that strategy might fall apart. In this year of the outsider, Greitens and Brunner consistently poll first and second in public polling. But it&rsquo;s pretty clear that Republican elites&ndash;some loyal to Catherine Hanaway, others loyal to Peter Kinder&ndash;encouraged Brunner to run for governor in 2016.</p>
<p>Second, in that July 18 post, I pointed out that the GOP consultant running Brunner&rsquo;s campaign has a bit of a conflict, too. That consultant is a longtime friend of Lt. Governor Peter Kinder. They both grew up in the tight Republican community of Cape Girardeau, Missouri. Peter Kinder is also a candidate for governor.</p>
<p>To be fair, I spoke to several Republican Party insiders who are supporting Greitens to varying degrees. They assured me that Brunner&rsquo;s consultant, David Barklage, is not working with Peter Kinder behind the scenes. So I&rsquo;ll take their word for it. But there&rsquo;s a lot of psychology in play with these people—Brunner, Kinder, and Barklage. So I&rsquo;m going to explore that in a bit.</p>
<p>But first, let&rsquo;s talk about that shadowy Navy SEAL who came to town a couple weeks ago and the bad things we learned about John Brunner.</p>
<h3 id="the-big-reveal">The Big Reveal</h3>
<p>We all know that John Brunner denied any involvement in the SEALs video. Flat denial, many times. Brunner gave himself zero wiggle room. Even Bill Clinton couldn&rsquo;t weasel his way out of Brunner&rsquo;s denials.</p>
<p>Then Paul Holzer came to town.</p>
<p>Paul Holzer is a former Navy SEAL and much more, as we&rsquo;ll see tomorrow. Two weeks ago, Holzer went on a media tour around Missouri, <strong>outing himself as the man behind the attack video</strong>. But even last week Holzer tried to conceal his</p>
<p>But even last week Holzer tried to conceal his <strong>paid position on Brunner&rsquo;s campaign</strong>.</p>
<p>According to STLToday, <strong><a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/military-ambush-ex-seal-rips-greitens-in-radio-show-doesn/article_28508caa-7f5a-54d5-868d-468ccdc51671.html">Holzer specifically denied any involvement in the Missouri governor&rsquo;s race</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the truth. About the time I was writing <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2015/07/18/can-john-brunners-consultant-do-his-duty/">that July 18 post</a>, Paul Holzer and his brother, Adam McLain, worked on John Brunner&rsquo;s campaign staff. <strong>Holzer alone raked in nearly $100,000 from the Brunner</strong> <strong>campaign</strong> last year before leaving to work with two shadowy organizations.</p>
<p>For months, the Brunner campaign denied any involvement in planning, producing, and distributing the video. Last year, Brunner denied any campaign involvement in a fake Greitens website operated by Holzer and McLain. In between, Brunner denied leaking a surreptitiously recorded phone call from Eric Greitens, even though Brunner had exclusive access to the recording. <strong>Clearly, Team Brunner has been less than forthcoming all along.</strong></p>
<p>The revelation that Brunner&rsquo;s former chief of staff produced the hit video raises many questions:</p>
<p>** Who commissioned the video?
** Who told Holzer to out himself last week?
** Who paid for Holzer&rsquo;s media tour in Missouri?
** Why is Holzer so disloyal to Brunner?
** Was Brunner really lying, or did someone keep him in the dark all along?</p>
<p>Over the next three days, let&rsquo;s see if we can build some logical answers to these questions that go to the heart of the Missouri Republican charade.</p>

Last week&amp;rsquo;s poll asked you to watch a video by Simon Sinek before answering two, simple, two-part questions: which Republican candidate for President and Missouri Governor is most likely and least likely to eat last?
I intended the poll to be hard. Not complicated, not long, but emotionally challenging.

I&amp;rsquo;ll answer this later, but first here&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m asking.
Who Would You Recruit? In response to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post on Brunner vs. Greitens, someone asked me a similar question about Eric Greitens. The inquisitor seems to question my judgment for preferring Greitens over John Brunner.
