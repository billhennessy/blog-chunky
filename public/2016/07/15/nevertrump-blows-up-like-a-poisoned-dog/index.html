<p>The Never Trump movement tried to make a stand. It failed by a massive margin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash;Kyle Cheney, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/donald-trump-convention-rules-win-225586">Politico</a></p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t even close, and I feel guilty.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look at Facebook too often. I have been on Facebook lately because it&rsquo;s a great vehicle for <a href="https://hennessysview.com/turning-on-trump/">book sales</a>, but I really don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>One problem with Facebook is that I can see what people are thinking. And so many people I know and respect think some really dumb things. Especially the NeverTrumpers.</p>
<p>As the Republican Convention neared, the NeverTrump rank-and-file believed all the lies told by their fearless leaders. Kendal Unruh had been assuring reporters and followers that the vote on a rules change would be &ldquo;close.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t. But before Thursday&rsquo;s defeat, NeverTrumpers were smug.</p>
<p>One NeverTrumper dreamed on Facebook of the convention chairman announcing the results of the anti-Trump rules vote by yelling at Mr. Trump: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fired!&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="vote-wasnt-close">Vote Wasn&rsquo;t Close</h3>
<p>That ain&rsquo;t gonna happen.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/donald-trump-convention-rules-win-225586">Politco</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Efforts to block Donald Trump’s nomination — hyped for months by proponents as a growing grassroots movement among Republican activists attending next week’s convention — turned out to be a flop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During key votes on Thursday evening, only 12 hardcore holdouts continued to resist Trump’s nomination as they were when members of on the powerful 112-member Convention Rules Committee considered a proposal to prevent delegates from rejecting Trump. A long-anticipated “conscience clause” proposal intended to stymie Trump fizzled with similarly minimal support.</p>
<p>The NeverTrump results were so bad supporters of the measures opted for voice votes. They didn&rsquo;t want their humiliation recorded.</p>
<h3 id="whats-next-for-nevertrump">What&rsquo;s Next for NeverTrump?</h3>
<p>Bill Kristol has vowed to continue using the NeverTrump movement to make money for himself. Kristol isn&rsquo;t really a NeverTrumper, just an opportunist.</p>
<p>But what about the rest of the movement?</p>
<p>Some who have made only a few public identity claims of NeverTrumpism will quietly join the winning team. These NeverTrumpers will get all caught up in the hoopla of the convention. They&rsquo;ll look at the latest weekly terror attack, they&rsquo;ll realize that a crooked Hillary administration would leave America under sharia law after four years. They&rsquo;ll humbly decide to support the best choice for President.</p>
<p>A few will actively campaign for the Libertarian candidate, knowing that their efforts could help Hillary Clinton but could never help the Libertarian win. In their minds, they&rsquo;ll be justified in supporting a pro-abortion, pro-gay marriage candidate. When you hear their justifications, though, you&rsquo;ll walk away scratching your head.</p>
<p>Finally, there are those <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2016/07/12/how-nevertrump-promotes-race-violence/">radicalized NeverTrumpers</a> like National Review&rsquo;s Kevin Williamson and George Will. These guys are hopeless <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2016/07/12/what-happens-you-identify-as-nevertrump/">psychological messes</a>. They will not only support Hillary Clinton but, as Trump&rsquo;s landslide victory becomes obvious, these radical <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2016/07/13/why-nevertrump-will-support-down-ballot-dems/">NeverTrumpers will throw their support to Democratic Senate candidates</a>.</p>
<p>For the grassroots people who fought against Trump to the end, it&rsquo;s time to <a href="https://hennessysview.com/turning-on-trump/">buy my book, Turning On Trump</a>. If I can do it, you can, too. And there&rsquo;s a lot of work to be done.</p>

                It&amp;rsquo;s possible that some NeverTrumper has already gone there, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it.
Up until now, one complaint of the NeverTurmpers has been that Mr. Trump will hurt Republicans running for Senate, the House, and state offices. They make this claim knowing full well that Trump is ahead of Romney in every poll and with every demographic group. I predict that, come October, people will be saying Trump is virtually running unopposed.

                When a person declares himself &amp;ldquo;NeverTrump,&amp;rdquo; he thinks he&amp;rsquo;s making a political statement. Or a moral one. But he&amp;rsquo;s not. He&amp;rsquo;s making a psychological commitment that&amp;rsquo;s very difficult and painful to break.
Identity is the highest, most powerful form of persuasion. Identity also drives our decisions in parts of the brain we don&amp;rsquo;t really have conscious control over. I realize many conservatives reject brain science, but, for those of you who are open to learning, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain as best I can in a moment.

                NeverTrumpers who don&amp;rsquo;t cross over stand to get a lot of blood on their hands. I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one noticing. If anything, I&amp;rsquo;m understating the case. Now we know: to be anti-Trump is to be pro-abortion and pro-race war. To be anti-Trump is to support violence against police officers, especially white police officers. That&amp;rsquo;s because Hillary is all those things, and to be anti-Trump is, logically, to be pro-Hillary. (If they both live until January 20, either Clinton or Trump will be the next president.
