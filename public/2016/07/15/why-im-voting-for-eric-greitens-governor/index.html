                            <p>I believe the greatest threat to human freedom and thriving is the political class. That smirking political class infects both Washington, DC, and Jefferson City, Missouri. And I believe only one candidate has the courage, the brains, and the commitment to destroy that political class in Missouri. That candidate is Eric Greitens.</p>
<p>Do you want to live as a slave to that smirking political class? Or do you want to live free and thrive?</p>
<p>Three Republican candidates for governor have crawled to the political class for help. One has not. That one is Eric Greitens.</p>
<p>Some of my friends attack Mr. Greitens, even on the St. Louis Tea Party blog, which I operate and fund. I let their attacks go out, under my name, not because I agree, but because I trust the people.</p>
<p>We have a simple policy for the contributors to that blog: write what you believe. If other contributors disagree, they can write what they believe. The people will sort it out. So, now, it&rsquo;s my turn.</p>
<h3 id="remnant-no-more">Remnant No More</h3>
<p>Many Tea Partiers want to remain political remnants. Political martyrs. Slaves to a self-imposed conformity. Self-righteous worshippers at the altar of the smirking political class. I know their feelings because I was a remnant for most of my life.</p>
<p>The president of the American Enterprise Institute, Dr. Arthur C. Brooks, explained the phenomenon in his book <a href="https://amzn.to/29y8HPz"><em>The Conservative Heart</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Tea Party rebellion, and the conservative grassroots it has energized, thus have some choices to make: Does it want to remain at step one, settle for 19 percent support (and falling), and become a permanent political remnant— capable of setting political brushfires, but too weak to bring about real lasting change in our nation? Or does it want to make a run at majority status and build a popular social movement that changes our country forever? <strong>Do Tea Party activists want to remain little more than the guardian of fiscally conservative orthodoxy holding the Republican establishment’s feet to the fire?</strong> Or can the Tea Party become something bigger— a transformational, majoritarian force in American politics that does not simply rebel against American decline, but reverses it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth is, <strong>if we want to reverse American decline, and not just rail against it, then we do in fact need a conservative majority to prevail</strong>. That requires that Tea Party patriots start thinking like a majoritarian social movement.</p>
<p>A vote for anyone other than Eric Greitens is a vote for permanent remnant status.</p>
<p>Yes, Eric Greitens began life as a Democrat, just like Ronald Reagan did. Yes, Eric Greitens applauded Democrats&rsquo; speeches, just like Ronald Reagan did. Yes, Eric Greitens wrote in support of big government programs, just like Ronald Reagan did.</p>
<p>But Eric Greitens has seen fit to move to the right because he&rsquo;s seen the damage done by the policies he once endorsed. Sensible people would help him make those corrections. Eric Greitens is fully equipped and prepared to fix Missouri.</p>
<p>The more Eric sees government in action, the more he seeks to restrain government.</p>
<p>Just like Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>And <strong>Greitens is the only Republican likely to beat the Democrat in November</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-political-class-bleeds-and-chokes-conservatism">The Political Class Bleeds and Chokes Conservatism</h3>
<p>Eric&rsquo;s opponents in this race have two things in common:</p>
<ol>
<li>They&rsquo;re (mostly) good people who love America and recite the conservative credo by heart.</li>
<li>They&rsquo;ve all pledged allegiance to the smirking political class.</li>
</ol>
<p>As long as that smirking political class holds sway in Jefferson City, our limited-government movement will remain a remnant, a faction, of frustrated grassroots activists waving signs that no one else reads or understands.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I believe Americans have a duty to blow up the political class first.</p>
<h3 id="combat-first-aid">Combat First Aid</h3>
<p>In military first aid class, we learned a three-step system for treating seriously injured shipmates:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop the bleeding.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Start the breathing.</li>
<li>Treat for shock.</li>
</ul>
<p>The smirking political class is a sucking chest wound on this country. It&rsquo;s bleeding us dry. Until we stop that bleeding, nothing else helps.</p>
<p>Crony capitalism sits on the chest of the American economy, suffocating growth. Until will corral crony capitalism, our solutions will fail.</p>
<p>And government-first thinking has shocked our constitutional, limited government system, almost beyond recognition. But our solutions will be wasted on a patient who&rsquo;s bleeding, not breathing, or dead.</p>
<p><strong>If your priority is anything but blowing up that smirking political class</strong>, then you&rsquo;re going to kill the patient. He&rsquo;ll bleed to death.</p>
<p><strong>If you tolerate crony capitalism</strong>, then you&rsquo;re going to kill the patient. He&rsquo;ll suffocate.</p>
<p><strong>The only way to save the patient</strong> is to stop the bleeding by blowing up the political class, start the breathing by destroying crony capitalism, and then start the breathing of limited government.</p>
<p>All four Republican candidates say they&rsquo;ll treat for shock, but three of the candidates would be performing mouth-to-mouth on a corpse. <strong>Only Eric Greitens will follow the proven, lifesaving method of field first aid.</strong></p>
<p>Without reservation or purpose of evasion, **I wholeheartedly and proudly repeat my endorsement of Eric Greitens for governor of Missouri. And I ask you to join me in saving our country. **</p>

                How people responded to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post, Maybe he&amp;rsquo;s not a conservative, varied. But there were two dominant types.
Surface thinkers ignored most of the content. I warned you about this early on. I decided against a deep examination of conservatism because people don&amp;rsquo;t care. Instead, I wrote a rather tongue-in-cheek story about why definitions of conservatism don&amp;rsquo;t matter.
Deep thinkers got the tongue-in-cheek shtick. Maybe they rolled their eyes at my cheap attempt at being clever.

                As far as I can tell, the number one reason a few conservatives give for hating Eric Greitens is that he might not be a conservative. He&amp;rsquo;s probably not. But that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t make any difference.
Figuring out whether Greitens is a conservative or not requires a lot of thinking, a lot of writing, and a lot of clear analysis from readers. I won&amp;rsquo;t waste time on the first two because I won&amp;rsquo;t get the last no matter what.

                Today I learned that I am not alone. I am not alone in my anger over a morally-bankrupt attempt to smear a great leader. And I learned that I am not alone in recognizing Eric Greitens&amp;rsquo;s singular ability to inspire and lead.
I also learned that Eric Greitens has some really stupid opponents. Cowardly, stupid weasels. Cowardly because Greitens&amp;rsquo;s opponents funded, produced, and promoted an anonymous video, packed with lies. Stupid because that video so infuriated Missouri&amp;rsquo;s 500,000 military veterans that Greitens is picking up new supporters.
