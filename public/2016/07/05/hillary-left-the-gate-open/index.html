                            <p>Many people grew up with dogs and backyards. If you are such a person, you probably remember being to told to make sure the gate&rsquo;s shut and locked. Or maybe you were told not to use the gate at all because the dog might get out.</p>
<p>A lot of people who grew up with dogs suffered emotional trauma when something bad happened to their dog. Imagine how you&rsquo;d feel if you were seven or eight and <strong>you left the gate open and the dog got out and got hit by a car</strong>.</p>
<p>Not only would you feel terrible, you&rsquo;d probably get in a lot of trouble. Your siblings would sort of hate you for a while, wouldn&rsquo;t they? Your mom and dad would probably punish you. But mostly you&rsquo;d feel terrible because you left the gate open and the dog got out and got killed. All because of you.</p>
<p>Your emotional suffering, in this case, shows <strong>you&rsquo;re emotionally stable and normal</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, imagine another kid. Let&rsquo;s call her Hillary, just for convenience. Hillary&rsquo;s mom and dad yelled at her to make sure the gate&rsquo;s locked, too. But Hillary ignored them. <strong>She left the gate open, the dog got out and was never seen again</strong>.</p>
<p>Unlike you, though, Hillary didn&rsquo;t feel bad at all. <strong>Hillary laughed</strong>. Her mom and dad, being very progressive parents, figured the pain of losing her dog and the guilt of being culpable for the lost dog were punishment enough. (They figured her laughter was an attempt to cover up her anguish.)</p>
<p>Unlike you, <strong>Hillary is probably a psychopath</strong>. Maybe Hillary has borderline personality disorder. Whatever Hillary&rsquo;s diagnosis, she&rsquo;s not normal like you. She&rsquo;s kind of dangerous.</p>
<p>Today the FBI director told us that Hillary Clinton is a lot like the Hillary in this story. She was told to keep the gate shut and locked, but she didn&rsquo;t. <strong>Hillary left the gate wide open because she wanted to</strong>. She used personal email servers with zero security&ndash;worse security than a typical home computer. And the dogs&ndash;classified intelligence of the highest order&ndash;got out. We don&rsquo;t yet know the extent of the damage Clinton did. <strong>Secrets leaked can be like time bombs that blow up later</strong>. Of course, <strong>Hillary just laughs about her gross negligence</strong> because her parents decided not to punish her.</p>
<p>Identity politics is a real thing, so <strong>Hillary Clinton will probably dominate the psychopathic vote in November</strong>. Everybody with borderline personality disorder will vote for her. So will all the people who killed their dogs as kids and didn&rsquo;t get in trouble for it.</p>
<p>But <strong>regular people like you and me will see a dead dog every time we see Hillary Clinton laugh</strong>. Eventually, the sight or sound of Hillary Clinton laughing will make you feel disgusted and sick and sad. You&rsquo;ll remember pets you&rsquo;ve lost when Hillary speaks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b.-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clintons-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system">the FBI told us today</a>:** Hillary Clinton laughs when pets get killed. **</p>

<p>As far as I know, Donald Trump never laughed about a pet getting killed, which is why I wrote <a href="https://amzn.to/29vj088">Turning On Trump</a>. If you love pets and you keep the gate shut, you should <a href="https://amzn.to/29sDD37">read my new book</a>. It has a much happier ending.</p>

                The government wants Apple to build a back door into the iPhone. Apple has refused.
I’m with Apple on this one.
This back door would allow the FBI to access the content of the San Bernardino terrorists’ phone, possibly exposing more terrorists. That would be a good thing.
But Apple never built a back door to the iPhone because no one can control the keys to such portals. If Apple builds it, every government spy agency in the world will be able to read your texts, see where you’ve been, and listen to your phone calls.

Hillary famously kept an email server in her private bedroom where it was safe from being used as Bill&amp;rsquo;s YouPorn hub. (I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure Bill Clinton hasn&amp;rsquo;t visited the inside of his wife&amp;rsquo;s sleeping chamber in the 21st century.)
Being plugged into the internet, though, and lacking even the most rudimentary security, Hillary&amp;rsquo;s server was exposed to the prying eyes of Chinese, North Korean, Russian, and Anonymous spies.

                When I was a kid (thought I felt kind of old at the time) disaster movies were the thing.
Before Star Wars, the 1970s were about killer sharks, towering infernos, earthquakes, and capsized cruise ships.
Psychologists and sociologists attributed the genre&amp;rsquo;s popularity to the people&amp;rsquo;s need to assimilate nuclear holocaust.
I think the movies were just good, cathartic entertainment.
