<p>Today Cruz proved himself to be Lyin&rsquo; Ted again.</p>
<p>After swearing that his non-endorsement was all about &ldquo;freedom and the Constitution,&rdquo; he admitted today that he broke his oath of support solely because Trump insulted his wife and his father. For Ted, this was personal, not business.</p>
<p>Ted could have told us it was personal last night. But he lied instead. He could have said something else, too. And if I were his speechwriter, I&rsquo;d have offered him something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Republican elephant in the room is looking at me, and you all know it. That elephant is asking, &ldquo;will he endorse or won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me address that once and for all.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t endorse Donald, I&rsquo;ll break my vow to my party and to my country, and I pride myself on keeping my word to voters.</p>
<p>But if I do endorse him, I&rsquo;ll feel in my heart that I&rsquo;m breaking my vow to love, honor, cherish, and obey my wife. Because I made my vow to Heidi first, and because I hold that vow and her love above all other commitments, I will not endorse Mr. Trump tonight. But I will, by the grace of God, eagerly vote for Trump and Pence on November 8, and I beg every one you to follow my example.</p>
<p>That would have brought the house down and made Cruz look like both a genius and a great man. As we learned, though, <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2016/07/20/what-its-like-to-meet-ted-cruz/">Cruz is neither</a>.</p>

            <div class="card-text">
                You&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking that Ted Cruz made Donald Trump look bad last night. And he did. Ted Cruz had a prime time speaking slot and he failed to endorse his party&amp;rsquo;s nominee for president. Hillary Clinton will use it.
A lot of people are saying Trump shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have invited him to speak unless Cruz agreed to endorse Trump. But Trump didn&amp;rsquo;t even ask for Cruz&amp;rsquo;s endorsement. Trump just offered Ted the prime time spot, and Ted took it.

            <div class="card-text">
                In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t hear, Donald Trump invited Ted Cruz to speak at the RNC in prime time with no expectation that Cruz would keep his word by endorsing Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz immediately accepted the prime time speaking spot.
In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t hear, Donald Trump waived his right to review Senator Cruz&amp;rsquo;s speech in advance, the first time that&amp;rsquo;s happened in our lifetimes according to Tucker Carlson. Mr. Trump respects Senator Cruz enough to let the senator say whatever he wants.

                You might have noticed that my predictions have been remarkably accurate lately, have you not?
For example, on Sunday, May 1, I predicted Ted Cruz would suspend his campaign after getting trounced in Indiana. Two days later, Cruz lost the Indiana primary to Donald Trump 53 to 36. At the time I wrote, many pundits and pollster still believed Cruz could win that Indiana race, and everyone believed Cruz was telling the truth when he said repeatedly he was staying in the race to Cleveland unless Trump reached 1,237 delegates before then.
