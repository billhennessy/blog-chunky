<h3 id="why-now">Why Now?</h3>
<p><strong>Why did Holzer choose last week to out himself?</strong> Why show himself now, putting his old boss, John Brunner, in such a bad light? And right before the August 2 primary?</p>
<p>**Holzer has damaged Brunner&rsquo;s reputation and credibility. **And Brunner spent a ton of his own money in the process, including paying $100,000 to the guy who made the video, then squealed about it. <strong>It almost looks like Paul Holzer meant to take out Brunner</strong>, does it not?</p>
<h3 id="who-pushed-holzer-to-show-himself">Who Pushed Holzer to Show Himself?</h3>
<p>You, like me, probably don&rsquo;t believe Holzer did this on his own**. Who told Holzer to show himself two weeks before the election?**</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at all the major missteps in the Brunner campaign so far:</p>
<p>** Brunner&rsquo;s former campaign staffers, Eric McLean and Paul Holzer, set up a PAC that launched a fake EricGrietens.com website to smear Greitens, denying they received any compensation for the site.
** Brunner consistently denied any connect to the fake smear site, even after the press reported the site&rsquo;s links to the Brunner campaign.
** Brunner secretly recorded a phone call with Eric Greitens, a dirty trick that Jane Duecker and Mark Reardon of KMOX both called &ldquo;sleazy.&rdquo;
** Brunner then leaked that audio recording.  (You&rsquo;ll want to read <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2015/11/29/fredo/">I Know It Was You, Fredo</a>.) Even sleazier.
** Brunner pushed an anti-Greitens video released anonymously, again claiming to have no idea who made the video. We now know that Paul Holzer, Brunner&rsquo;s former chief of staff, made the video.
** Now it looks like the Brunner camp took Paul Holzer on a media tour in Missouri, more or less admitting Brunner had been lying about connections to the video all along.</p>
<p>To the casual observer, it seems Holzer&rsquo;s media tour was intended to take out Brunner, not Greitens.</p>
<p>So why?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my hypothesis.</p>
<p>Peter Kinder and Catherine Hanaway are both political insiders and known quantities. The Republican establishment in Missouri will always prefer the devil they know to the devil they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that the establishment, in the form of Missouri&rsquo;s political consultants, used Brunner&rsquo;s money and campaign to hold Greitens down. They&rsquo;ve done a good job getting a lot of conservatives freaked about Greitens&rsquo; conversion to conservatism. In fact, the many lies and innuendoes about Greitens have driven a lot of conservatives to flat-out hate the guy. I never thought I&rsquo;d see my friends from the Tea Party mocking and denigrating someone&rsquo;s military service, but that&rsquo;s exactly the depth a lot of them have sunk to.</p>
<p>When you look the polls, you find that all four candidates hover around 20 to 25 percent with Greitens holding a slight lead. Because of the animosity, Brunner&rsquo;s supporters feel toward Greitens, the party&rsquo;s consultants assume that disaffected Brunner supporters will defect to Hanaway or Kinder, but not to Greitens.</p>
<p>In other words, I think the Missouri political class used Brunner as a stooge, and now they&rsquo;re done with him. To ensure the GOP nominee is acceptable to the political class, they set Brunner up for a late fall. That political will probably work for Chris Koster in the general election just to keep their power. Koster&rsquo;s an elitist, too.</p>
<p>All this could happen without Hanaway&rsquo;s or Kinder&rsquo;s knowledge. Certainly, the operatives had to keep Brunner in the dark. <strong>I bet John Brunner was as surprised as anyone when Paul Holzer showed up for a series of interviews two weeks ago.</strong> Brunner is smart enough to know that exposing Holzer this late would destroy Brunner&rsquo;s credibility, not Greitens&rsquo;s because Brunner denied any connection to the video for months.</p>
<h3 id="will-brunner-sing">Will Brunner Sing?</h3>
<p>John Brunner was pretty bitter and angry after that 2012 defeat. He told friends he&rsquo;d never again fund his own campaign, and he&rsquo;d never again work with a consultant. Those were, of course, empty promises. **But if Brunner felt used after 2012, how do you think he&rsquo;ll feel this time? **</p>

<p>If I were a reporter,** I&rsquo;d stay very close to John Brunner on August 2.**</p>
<p>For the record, I endorsed Eric Greitens because I believe breaking up the state&rsquo;s political establishment is the most important thing for Missouri. I also think Greitens is the Republican candidate who can beat Chris Koster.</p>

That Shadowy Paul Holzer Paul Holzer is a former Navy SEAL Lieutenant Commander and a medical student at Dartmouth in New Hampshire. (Oddly, his bio shows MD, MBA, even though is still in medical school and simultaneously working toward an MBA.) Holzer also runs a biotech 501c3 and a political consulting firm, Draper Sterling LLC. He did some work for Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign, and he was John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s chief of staff last year.

 Things just got weirder in Missouri. After the stunning revelation that people associated with John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s campaign did, in fact, produce a false, negative video attacking Eric Greitens, you might be wondering what&amp;rsquo;s going on?

I&amp;rsquo;m sure John Brunner never saw himself as Fredo Corleone.
A Burning Question Did you ever ask yourself why John Brunner would release a surreptitious recording of a phone call with an opponent?
