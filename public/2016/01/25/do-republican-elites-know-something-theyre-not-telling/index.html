                            <p>Reading two excellent articles by Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/one-big-reason-to-be-less-skeptical-of-trump/">here</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/one-big-reason-to-be-less-skeptical-of-trump/">here</a>), I remembered a thought that passed through  my mind last Friday.</p>
<p>After reading some of National Review&rsquo;s &ldquo;Against Trump&rdquo; issue,<a href="https://hennessysview.com/2016/01/22/trumps-conservative-critics-dont-get-it/"> I wrote blog post</a>. To me the NR issue showed the magazine is out of touch with voters. I&rsquo;m not talking about traditional, reliable, motivated, and informed primary voters.** I&rsquo;m talking about the broader pool of voters who vote in general elections every four, eight, or twelve years** and occasionally in local elections. (Yes, there are people like that.)</p>
<p>The bits I&rsquo;ve read since then reinforce my perception that conservative pundits (count me in) often (always) forget that <strong>most Americans are not conservative pundits.</strong> Then there&rsquo;s this gem from Rod Dreher on American Conservative, <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/trump-conservative-intelligentsia/">Trump &amp; the Conservative Intelligentsia</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moving back to Louisiana to live really did reveal to me the gap between the conservative punditocracy and those for whom they — for whom <em>we</em> — presume to speak. <strong>Ideas and reason matter far less to most people than they do to people like us</strong> (this is true of the left as well), not because most people are stupid, but <strong>because their mode of experiencing life is not nearly as abstract as ours</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[<a href="https://hennessysview.com/2015/09/09/why-welfare-reform-must-continue/">Why conservatives need to stop talking about abstract political principles and promote conservative policies that help real people.</a>]</p>
<p>People who hang around with conservative activists have trouble seeing the world from any other perspective. And there are, at best, a few thousand conservative activists, pundits, writers, and radio/TV hosts in America. And 320 million &ldquo;others.&rdquo; You get the point.</p>
<p>So the easy answer to NR&rsquo;s Trump issue is <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2013/03/07/why-being-wrong-can-be-the-best-policy/">affinity bubbles</a>. Now, what&rsquo;s the not-so-easy answer.</p>
<p>Maybe Republican elites (and you have to include Ted Cruz&rsquo;s campaign in that mix) know something they&rsquo;re not saying. **Maybe National Review just wanted to be able to claim victory when Trump loses Iowa badly. **</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that Trump is polling in Iowa and somehow keeping it very quiet. Businesses are really, really good at stealth polling. But a lot of newspapers claim he is not polling at all. He&rsquo;s flying blind.</p>
<p>The other campaigns and PACs are polling like their lives depend on it. Polling is one of the consultant class&rsquo;s biggest money makers. Cruz, Rubio, Carson, Jeb!, Carly, and Christie have numbers that you and I do not see.</p>
<p>We also hear that** Trump has almost no ground organization in Iowa**. And public polls show that a lot of Trump&rsquo;s support (up to 30 percent) comes from non-traditional caucusers. (But reports of no ground game could be hogwash, too.)</p>
<p>If you put it all together, <strong>it&rsquo;s very possible that the Republican elites believe Trump will get trounced in Iowa.</strong></p>
<p>That would explain why the GOP establishment has made Cruz, not Trump, their Party Enemy Number One. They could reason that Trump&rsquo;s rise owes to his perceived invulnerability. If he stumbles in Iowa, the mask will slip and his supporters will scramble for another candidate.</p>
<p>The Establishment does not want Trump-defectors to find a home with Cruz, so they&rsquo;re building the case that Cruz is worse than Trump. With Cruz struggling in New Hampshire, the winner of New Hampshire could quickly gain a lot of energy going into South Carolina.</p>
<p>In other words,** the GOP Establishment could be killing two insurgents with one Iowa surge.**</p>
<p>If the second scenario is the way it is, Rich Lowry and crew are busy planning their victory lap right now, and I should be writing my mea culpa. (Unless his blog counts.)</p>
<p>But, again, only time will tell.</p>

Maybe I just want people to think I&amp;rsquo;m the kind of person who hates electoral politics. (We are all capable of being wrong about ourselves.)
I have to say, briefly, that this was the most encouraging Republican debate since . . . 1980? These are all serious people, and I&amp;rsquo;m including Trump. They all love America, and not just what they might get from America.

The conservative war against Trump won&amp;rsquo;t work.
I get why National Review and The Weekly Standard devote whole issues of magazines to Trump&amp;rsquo;s lack of conservative bonafides. I appreciate it. Their work is important. **But their tactic will prove completely useless in defeating Trump. **In fact, the fight is already over, and the cover story proves it.
Conservative magazines&amp;ndash;online or on paper&amp;ndash;are supposed to weigh events and people against conservative principles and pass judgment.
