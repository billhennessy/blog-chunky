<blockquote>
<p>Nonnie Parry: [Deck behind the group is flooding rapidly] How long will we stay afloat?</p>

<p>James Martin: Long enough</p>
<p>Robin Shelby: The Andrea Doria stayed afloat 10 hours before she sank.</p>
<p>&ndash;<em>The Poseidon Adventure</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doug Roberts: I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe they just oughta leave it the way it is. Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; <em>The Towering Inferno</em></p>
<p>And then there was the more personal and mysterious horror flick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wendy Torrance: Hey. Wasn&rsquo;t it around here that the Donner Party got snowbound?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jack Torrance: I think that was farther west in the Sierras.</p>
<p>Wendy Torrance: Oh.</p>
<p>Danny Torrance: What was the Donner Party?</p>
<p>Jack Torrance: They were a party of settlers in covered-wagon times. They got snowbound one winter in the mountains. They had to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive.</p>
<p>Danny Torrance: You mean they ate each other up?</p>
<p>Jack Torrance: They had to, in order to survive.</p>
<p>Wendy Torrance: Jack&hellip;</p>
<p>Danny Torrance: Don&rsquo;t worry, Mom. I know all about cannibalism. I saw it on TV.</p>
<p>Jack Torrance: See, it&rsquo;s okay. He saw it on the television.</p>
<p>When the Presidential campaign began, pundits saw the stars lining up for Hillary Clinton. (I didn&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;ve never been any good at seeing things in the stars.)</p>
<p>Hillary was running more or less unopposed for the Democrat nomination. She could pack in the cash and build an oppo file on the Republicans throughout 2015, receive her party&rsquo;s coronation at the convention, then come out guns blazing in September when people start to pay attention.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Republicans would rip each other to shreds. Seventeen candidates would make fools of themselves trying to tear down the heir-apparent, Jeb Bush. In vain, because Jeb Bush was invincible with his family name and endorsements and war chest. And no Bush has ever beaten a Clinton.</p>
<p>That was the prevailing narrative in May 2015. My, how times have changed.</p>
<p>Democrats will now run to RealClearPolitics and say &ldquo;but, but, but the polls!&rdquo; Yeah. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>The SS Hillary is a ship taking on water beyond the capacity of the the drain pump to discharge overboard</strong>. The Andria Doria stayed afloat 10 days. I&rsquo;m not sure the Hillary Clinton can survive 10 weeks.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s sinking the Hillary:</p>
<p>** <a href="https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/kyle-drennen/2016/01/11/andrea-mitchell-fears-benghazi-movie-conspiracy-theories-will-hurt">Benghazi won&rsquo;t go away</a>
** Hillary introduced Bill Clinton&rsquo;s unresolved sexual harassment charges, and<a href="https://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/04/hillary-heckled-again-by-rape-survivor-over-bills-er-history-with-women/"> the issue&rsquo;s not helping</a>
** <a href="https://www.wnd.com/2016/01/what-bernie-the-donald-portend/">Bernie Sanders only grows in popularity with the Democrats&rsquo; socialist base</a>
** <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2016/01/11/bill-cosby-should-ask-for-change-of-venue-to-cologne-germany/">Political correctness&ndash;a product of the Clinton era&ndash;is a dirty word for most Americans</a>
** <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/11/politics/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-income-inequality/index.html">Joe Biden prefers himself or Sanders</a>
** <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/01/11/mary-matalin/">Elizabeth Warren lurks in the wings</a>
** <a href="https://observer.com/2015/10/jim-webb-says-hes-seriously-looking-at-a-third-party-run/">Jim Webb might run as a third-party moderate</a>
** <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-foundation-probe-is-months-old-former-attorney/article/2580136">150 FBI agents and DoJ investigators are preparing an indictment over Hillary&rsquo;s email server</a>
** <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/06/law-enforcement-officials-medical-professionals-theres-something-seriously-wrong-hillary-clintons-health/">Hillary&rsquo;s health problems won&rsquo;t go away</a>
** <a href="https://www.redstate.com/2016/01/09/report-20-trumps-supporters-may-disaffected-democrats/">Fewer people are willing to say they won&rsquo;t vote for Trump under any circumstances</a></p>
<p>Are many of these stories the product of wishful thinking? Sure. But not all.</p>
<p>And any one of these stories could stop Hillary dead in her tracks. If she loses Iowa or New Hampshire, or both, her campaign could be over.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I predicted Hillary would not run. When she announced, I modified that to say she would not make it to the DNC convention.</p>
<p>Look how the parties have reversed. The Republicans are down to two candidates: Trump and Cruz. And they&rsquo;re the only two who seem unwilling to attack each other (despite fraudulent attempts by the press to make people believe they are.)</p>
<p>And the Democrats are cannibalizing their own. Realizing that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-is-attacking-because-shes-panicky/">he has a chance</a> at the nomination, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/us/politics/bernie-sanders-attacks-hillary-clinton-over-regulating-wall-street.html?_r=0">Colonel Sanders is now battling Clinton in earnest</a>, and <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/h-a-goodman/clinton-attacks-bernie-sanders-on-guns-_b_8952808.html">Clinton is feebly fighting back</a>.</p>
<p>The old days of the 1990s aren&rsquo;t helping. In fact, they&rsquo;re getting in the way. And her time at State seems more like time in in the state penitentiary. Her excuses seem weak. Her plans seemed warmed-over. And she seems tired.</p>
<p>I stand by my prediction. And I&rsquo;m more confident every day. Hillary will be nothing more than an honored guest at her party&rsquo;s convention.</p>

                On New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve, male Muslim refugees rampaged across Europe.
They didn&amp;rsquo;t use guns and bombs. They used their bodies. On women.
This created a political-correctness nightmare for Europe&amp;rsquo;s leaders. On the one hand, the victims were women, and no means no, and we must always believe a woman who accuses a man of sexual predation (unless the man is Bill Clinton in which case we destroy the woman).
On the other hand, the assailants .

The first five people who told me they supported Trump in 2015 also supported Ross Perot in 1992.
I realize it&amp;rsquo;s a tiny sample size. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that Donald Trump is the reincarnation of H. Ross Perot. Conservatives&amp;ndash;all conservatives and all center-right voters&amp;ndash;need to come to terms with that fact. We must also deal with the realities of the 2016 election and choose a strategy.
