<p>Subject: READ ONLY IF YOU HAVE TIME FOR GOD</p>
<p>God, when I received this e-mail, I thought&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have time for this&hellip; And, this is really inappropriate during work.</p>
<p>Then, I realized that this kind of thinking is&hellip; Exactly, what has caused lot of the problems in our world today.</p>
<p>We try to keep God in church on Sunday morning&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe, Sunday night&hellip;</p>
<p>And, the unlikely event of a midweek service.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We do like to have Him around during sickness&hellip;</p>
<p>And, of course, at funerals.</p>
<p>However, we don&rsquo;t have time, or room, for Him during work or play&hellip;</p>
<p>Because&hellip; That&rsquo;s the part of our lives we think&hellip; We can, and should, handle on our own.</p>
<p>May God forgive me for ever thinking&hellip;</p>
<p>That&hellip; there is a time or place where&hellip;</p>
<p>HE is not to be FIRST in my life.</p>
<p>We should always have time to remember all HE has done for us.</p>
<p>If, You aren&rsquo;t ashamed to do this&hellip;</p>
<p>Please follow the directions.</p>
<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;If you are ashamed of me, I will be</p>
<p>ashamed of you before my Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not ashamed?</p>
<p>Pass this on ONLY IF YOU MEAN IT!!</p>
<p>Yes, I do Love God.</p>
<p>HE is my source of existence and Savior.</p>
<p>He keeps me functioning each and every day. Without Him, I will be nothing. Without Him, I am nothing. But, with Christ, HE strengthens me. (Phil 4:13) This is the simplest test.</p>
<p>If You Love God&hellip; And, are not ashamed of all  the marvelous things HE</p>
<p>has done for you&hellip;</p>
<p>Send this to ten people and the person who sent  it to you!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I know 10 people who would admit they love Jesus. Do You love Him?</p>
<p>THE POEM</p>
<p>I knelt to pray but not for long,</p>
<p>I had too much to do. I had to hurry and get to work For bills would soon be due.</p>
<p>So I knelt and said a hurried prayer,</p>
<p>And jumped up off my knees.</p>
<p>My Christian duty was now done</p>
<p>My soul could rest at ease.</p>
<p>All day long I had no time</p>
<p>To spread a word of cheer. No time to speak of Christ to friends,</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d laugh at me I&rsquo;d fear.</p>
<p>No time, no time, too much to do,</p>
<p>That was my constant cry,</p>
<p>No time to give to souls in need</p>
<p>But at last the time, the time to die.</p>
<p>I went before the Lord, I came, I stood with downcast eyes. For in his hands God held a book; It was the book of life.</p>
<p>God looked into his book and said</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name I cannot find.</p>
<p>I once was going to write it down&hellip;</p>
<p>But never found the time&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now do you have the time to pass it on?</p>
<p>Make sure that you scroll through to the end.</p>
<p>Easy vs. Hard</p>
<p>Why is it so hard to tell the truth but Yet so easy to</p>
<p>tell a lie?</p>
<p>Why are we so sleepy in church but Right when the sermon is over we suddenly wake up?</p>
<p>Why is it so hard to talk about God but yet so easy to talk about nasty stuff?</p>
<p>Why is it so boring to look at a Christian magazine, but yet so easy to look at a nasty one?</p>
<p>Why is it so easy to delete a Godly e- ma il, but yet we forward all of the nasty ones?</p>
<p>Why are the churches getting smaller but yet the bars and dance clubs are getting larger?</p>
<p>Do you give up? Think about it . Are you going to forward this, or delete it?</p>
<p>Just remember-God is watching you. Prayer Wheel-Let&rsquo;s see the devil stop this one!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the wheel is all about. When you receive this, say a prayer for the person that sent it to you&hellip;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you have to do&hellip;.</p>
<p>There is nothing attached&hellip;.</p>
<p>This is so powerful&hellip;.</p>
<p>Do not stop the wheel, please&hellip;.</p>
<p>Of all the free gifts we may receive, Prayer is the very best one&hellip;.</p>
<p>There are no costs, but wonderful rewards&hellip; GOD BLESS!</p>
<p>May God keep you and bless you. If this doesn&rsquo;t give you chills, nothing will&hellip;this message is very true. Hope you are all as blessed as I was from this story. I wonder how many people will delete this without reading it because of the title on it?</p>
<p>There once was a man named George Thomas, pastor in a small New England town. One Easter Sunday morning he came to the Church carrying a rusty, bent, old bird cage, and set it by the pulpit. Eyebrows were raised and, as if in response, Pastor Thomas began to speak&hellip;&ldquo;I was walking through town yesterday when I saw a young boy coming toward me swinging this bird cage. On the</p>
<p>bottom of the cage were three little wild birds, shivering with cold and fright. I stopped the lad and asked, &ldquo;What you got there, son?&rdquo; &ldquo;Just some old birds,&rdquo; came the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you gonna do with them?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take &lsquo;em home and have fun with &lsquo;em,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna tease &lsquo;em and pull out their feathers to make &lsquo;em fight. I&rsquo;m gonna have a real good time.&rdquo; &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll get tired of those birds sooner or later. What will you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I got some cats,&rdquo; said the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They like birds. I&rsquo;ll take &lsquo;em to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pastor was silent for a moment. &ldquo;How much do you want for those birds, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh? Why, you don&rsquo;t want them birds,  mister. They&rsquo;re just plain old field birds. They don&rsquo;t sing. They ain&rsquo;t even pretty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; the pastor asked again.</p>
<p>The boy sized up the pastor as if he were crazy and said, &ldquo;$10?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pastor reached in his pocket and took out a ten dollar bill. He placed it in the boy&rsquo;s hand. In a flash, the boy was gone.</p>
<p>The pastor picked up the cage and gently carried it to the end of the alley where there was a tree and a grassy spot. Setting the cage down, he opened the door, and by softly tapping the bars persuaded the birds out, setting them free.</p>
<p>Well, that explained the empty bird cage on the pulpit, and then the pastor began to tell this story.</p>
<p>One day Satan and Jesus were having a conversation. Satan had just come from the Garden of Eden, and he was gloating and boasting. &ldquo;Yes, sir, I just caught the world full of people down there. Set me a trap, used bait I knew they couldn&rsquo;t resist. Got &lsquo;em all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with them?&rdquo; Jesus  asked.</p>
<p>Satan replied, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m gonna have fun! I&rsquo;m gonna teach them how to marry and divorce each other, how to hate and abuse each other, how to drink and smoke and curse. I&rsquo;m gonna teach them how to invent guns and bombs and kill each other. I&rsquo;m really gonna have fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will you do when you get done with them?&rdquo; Jesus asked. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll kill &lsquo;em,&rdquo; Satan glared proudly. &ldquo;How much do you want for them?&rdquo; Jesus asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t want those people. They ain&rsquo;t no good. Why, you&rsquo;ll take them and they&rsquo;ll just hate you. They&rsquo;ll spit on you, curse you and kill you. You don&rsquo;t want those people!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; He asked again.</p>
<p>Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, &ldquo;All your blood, tears and your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;DONE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then He paid the price.</p>
<p>The pastor picked up the cage he opened the door and he walked from the pulpit.</p>
<p>Notes: Isn&rsquo;t it funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world&rsquo;s going to hell.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny how someone can say &ldquo;I believe in God&rdquo; but still follow Satan (who, by the way, also &ldquo;believes&rdquo; in God).</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny how you can send a thousand jokes through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding</p>
<p>the Lord, people think twice about sharing?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny how when you go to forward this message, you will not send it to many on your address list because you&rsquo;re not sure what they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it to them.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny how I can be more worried about what other people think of me than what God thinks of me.</p>
<p>I pray, for everyone who sends this to their entire address book, they</p>
<p>will be blessed by God in a way special for them.</p>
<p>And send it back to the person who sent it, to  let them know that indeed it was sent out to many more.</p>
<p>May God Bless each and every one!</p>
