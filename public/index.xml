      <description>WASHINGTON — Members of the so-called &amp;ldquo;Obama Alumni Association&amp;rdquo; feel harassed and abused by the former president whose late-night, drunken conference calls have become annoying, frequent, and less coherent as time goes on.
Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View has learned that Obama began these occasional conference calls with a handful of former officials about six months after leaving office in 2017. Over time, the 44th president stopped following a semi-weekly schedule of planned calls.</description>

      <description>One of the most despicable men alive, ABC News White House reporter Jon Karl, took his shot a Pulitzer for online journalism today by snitching on Fox News&amp;rsquo; John Roberts.
Roberts, aparently, was the last person outdoors in the Rose Garden, to put on his mask.
Look a &amp;ldquo;Karen&amp;rdquo; Karl&amp;rsquo;s snotty tweet:

      <description>We have all come to know some things about Dr. Deborah Birx, the doctor responsible for the White House&amp;rsquo;s Coronavirus response. Her clear explanations often highlighted the nightly White House Coronavirus Task Force press conferences.
Night after night, we watched and listened as Dr. Birx carefully explained complex statistical and medical information in a way even a reporter could understand. Her style is considered and precise. Understatement and exaggeration seem genetic impossibilities for Dr.</description>
