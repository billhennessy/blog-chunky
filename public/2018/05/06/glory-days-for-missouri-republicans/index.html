<p>My father-in-law said it.</p>
<p>The man did a few tours in Vietnam as a Marine. He&rsquo;s as right-wing as they get. Trump all the way. Honorable. Honest. Very good man. You&rsquo;d be lucky to know one as good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never trust a Republican,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He votes Republican. But he doesn&rsquo;t trust them. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Democrats stick together. You could glue Republicans together and they&rsquo;d still break apart.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He was talking about the Greitens case, and he was 100% right. Never trust a Republican. </p>
<p>For the record, <strong>I am not a Republican</strong>. I vote Republican over 95% of the time. (Libertarian the rest of the time.) I support many Republican candidates, like Donald Trump and Eric Greitens and, of course, <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2018/04/22/a-candidate-with-skin-in-the-game/">Dottie Bailey</a>. But <strong>I stopped identifying as a Republican when Bob Dole bought the GOP nomination for President in 1996.</strong></p>
<p>Many <strong>Republican politicians follow dull scripts that try to relive the past.</strong> Their anthem is Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Glory Days.&rdquo; They often lack imagination and integrity. They tell others how to live but apply no standards to themselves. They don&rsquo;t take cold showers, and they don&rsquo;t do deadlifts.</p>
<p>In other words, many <strong>Republican politicians are almost indistinguishable from Democrats.</strong></p>
<p>Almost.</p>
<p>Unlike Republicans, Democrats fight tooth and nail for their own. Democrats are tribal and social, while Republicans look out for themselves. Republicans confuse rugged individualism with every-man-for-
himselfism.</p>
<p>The Missouri Republican legislators who voted in favor of a special session to consider impeaching their governor Eric Greitens sort of <em>proved</em> my father-in-law&rsquo;s point. They acted on impulse to protect themselves. They didn&rsquo;t even consider the good of the party or the good of the state. They apparently considered only themselves and their precious invitations to Jefferson City&rsquo;s weird and depraved nightlife. Glory Days.</p>
<p>In a couple of weeks, <strong>those Republican will slither back to their districts to face their constituents</strong>. Constituents who voted overwhelmingly for Governor Eric Greitens. Constituents who don&rsquo;t get invited to <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2018/04/30/missouri-crimes/">Scott Faughn&rsquo;s weird party pad in JC</a>.</p>
<p>Those Republicans will wish they had some spine. And some friends. They&rsquo;ll be talking about their Glory Days.</p>
<p>When those Republican legislators return to places like Dent County, they&rsquo;ll probably hear things that will shock them. Shock them like a <strong>live wire</strong>. Quick and painful. They&rsquo;ll long for their Glory Days.</p>
<p>And they earned it.</p>

<p>Well there&rsquo;s a girl that lives up the block<br>
back in

Sometimes on a
Friday I&rsquo;ll stop by<br>
and have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed<br>
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up<br>
I guess it&rsquo;s two years gone by now<br>
We just sit around talking about the old times,<br>

                Scott Faughn&amp;rsquo;s name came up in conversation last week.
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s this Faughn guy&amp;rsquo;s role in the Greitens&amp;rsquo; investigation?&amp;rdquo; someone asked.
Faughn is the publisher of Missouri Times and a former mayor of Poplar Bluff, Missouri. Papers call him a &amp;ldquo;power broker.&amp;rdquo; Others call him the &amp;ldquo;Candy Man.&amp;rdquo;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the question. &amp;ldquo;Not sure,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;His paper hates Grietens, but that&amp;rsquo;s as much as know. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been to his weird, hidden party pad in Jefferson City.

                People have an innate sense of justice.   One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful,3 and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, “She is Bathsheba,the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.” 4 Then David sent messengers to get her.

                My blog includes links to related posts at the bottom of every individual post page. I usually don&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention, but today I noticed something. (BTW, this new theme looks great on phones.)
One of the old stories in the Eric Greitens category was my first comments on his book Resilience﻿. My old post talked about why it took me so long to finish the book. And it contained two short passages from the book.
