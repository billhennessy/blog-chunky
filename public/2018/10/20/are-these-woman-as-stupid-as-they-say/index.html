<p>According to everyone from CNN to the Cook Political Report, these college-educated suburban women have no control over their emotions or their hormones. They self-sabotage and sabotage their families just to quell their own emotional urges. </p>
<p>In other words, the media say college-educated suburban women are all hysterical. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a terrible, sexist thing for the CNN to say about these women. I don&rsquo;t believe it. </p>
<p>College-educated suburban women may feel negative emotions about Donald Trump and the Republicans, but they&rsquo;re smart enough to know that Trump and the Republicans are good for their careers and their families. Would a woman really ruin herself and her kids just because it feels good to her? </p>
<p>My mom sacrificed for my sisters and me. Sacrificed. She would never have voted for a violent Democrat mob just because it felt better. My mom, whose only post-high school education was nursing school, knew that her emotions needed to come after her family and her career. People have to eat. </p>
<p>If the Democrats win the House of the Representatives because college-educated suburban women vote like it&rsquo;s comfort food, the economy will probably tank, taxes will rise, the government will probably be shut down most of the next two years, and suburban home values will plummet. </p>
<p>In other words, Democrats will make the lives of college-educated suburban women nightmares. </p>
<p>I think CNN and Cook are wrong. I think women are able to put reason, judgment, and responsibility ahead of their own raging emotions. I trust in women to do the right thing for themselves, their families, and their communities even if it hurts their feelings to do it. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t sell women short. </p>

                The RNC’s Autopsy report wants to do away with caucuses and conventions, replacing them with regional primaries. But I’ll propose a different reform that will make candidate selection more interesting, whether in a caucus or a primary.
A Word About The Autopsy The idea of compacting the primary season and eliminating caucuses has some merit, but also a lot of downside. On the plus side are splashier events to showcase the party, fewer Tuesdays littered with politics, and, believe it or not, some economies as candidates can focus on one geographical region at a time.

                If you need to blame someone for our election losses, blame me.

I Let You Down I could have done more. I could have spoken up sooner. I could have been more honest with you about the mistakes we made and the opportunities we ignored. I could have worked harder on what I saw as the most important work we could do.
I let you down. I focused on petty issues of the day, too, instead of working on a different future.
