<p>Every person on this list is a felony suspect and should be treated as such by everyone.</p>
<h3 id="someone-or-more-leaked-the-flynn-call-to-the-new-york-times">Someone (or more) Leaked the Flynn Call to the New York Times</h3>
<p>We know that the New York Times received details of the Flynn call to Russian Amb. Kislyak from one of the people on this list. One or more.</p>
<p>We know that leaking intercepted communications &ldquo;obtained by the processes of communication intelligence from the communications of any foreign government&rdquo; is a felony punishable by 10 years in federal prison.</p>
<p>And we know that Joe Biden, the Democrat nominee for President of the United States is one of the suspects of this felony.</p>
<h3 id="and-the-entire-deep-state-is-circling-the-wagons">And the Entire Deep State Is Circling the Wagons</h3>
<p>Judge Emmett Sullivan is creating precedent faster than the Marshall Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Yesterday, he effectively rejected the DOJ&rsquo;s dropping of charges against General Mike Flynn. The DOJ dropped charged because the DOJ, by its own admission, conducted a blackmail operation against Flynn and his son for the purpose of toppling the duly elected president.</p>
<p>The Department of of Justice attempted a coup. It got caught. It dropped charges. And Emmett &ldquo;Scum&rdquo; Sullivan, a profane and prejudiced judge, rejected the DOJ&rsquo;s admission of guilt.</p>

</figure>

<p>Today, &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; Sullivan asked a retired Clinton-appointed judge to represent the Department of Justice <em>ad litem</em> in order to build a new case against General Flynn.</p>
<p>This has never happened in American history. A department of the US government is being represented by an enemy at the order of a rogue judge.</p>
<p>America is done.</p>
<h3 id="give-up-on-the-law">Give Up on the Law</h3>
<p>There is no political-science evidence that the rule of law or the legal system still exists in the United States. Almost every senior member of the Obama administration spied on General Michael Flynn for political purposes. That is undeniable.</p>
<p>The FBI and the Department of Justice, under President Obama, conducted an illegal spy and propaganda operation against the duly-elected president for the purposes of overthrowing the government. This, too, is undeniable.</p>
<p>A federal judge is refusing to accept a prosecutor&rsquo;s admission of prosecutorial misconduct in order to please his political masters. Also undeniable.</p>
<p>We refrain from open rebellion why?</p>

                Agents of the FBI plotted to frame and destroy General James Flynn for politic purposes according to handwritten notes released today.
General Flynn, a 30-year Army veteran and 3-star General, pled guilty to false charges in order to protect his family from further harassment by the FBI in 2017.
Now, the law firm that once represented Flynn has release thousands of documents it previously illegally refused to turn over. One of those documents is a handwritten note.

I hear she&amp;rsquo;s losing a lot of support from Democrat Party insiders, at least in private. The DNC is meeting this week, and talk will likely surround an alternative Democrats can vote for.
While Republicans enjoy the Clinton meltdown, we might want to be careful what we wish for.
One of the GOP&amp;rsquo;s best hopes for the White House is voter enthusiasm. Republicans can&amp;rsquo;t wait to vote, Democrats dread it.
