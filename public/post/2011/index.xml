      <description>Here are the top Hennessy’s View posts of each month of 2012, scientifically selected by . . . me.

January
The Gabrielle Giffords shooting by lunatic Jerod Lee Loughner was the biggest news event of the month. The cynically attempted to use the tragedy for political gain. The left failed.
February
The Arab Spring began last winter. When Mubarak was on the ropes in Egypt, some questioned whether or not his fall would be good for the region and the world.</description>

      <description>Some St. Louis area conservatives cheered Roy Blunt’s (R-MO) elevation to the Number 5 leadership position in the Senate Republican caucus.

I didn’t. At least not politically. I like Senator Blunt personally, so I’m happy in that respect. But I’m not happy for the reasons some others are.
First, as I told Jo Mannies of the St. Louis Beacon, internal party stuff isn’t really a Tea Party matter. Leadership in the Senate’s GOP caucus is for Republican Senators to worry about.</description>

      <description>Everyone knows and accepts that government does stupid things. Sometimes it feels like people institute governments and delegate them certain powers just to give us something to complain about.
Government stupidity, scandal, and corruption hits different people in different ways. Government hyperactivity keeps poor people poor by limiting opportunity and by building barriers to exiting poverty programs. “If you take that job, you’ll lose your health insurance.” Compassion my non-qualifying asset.</description>

      <description>_This is the fourth in a series. If you haven’t, please read part 1, part 2, and part 3. _
Because so many school systems have driven great English literature out of students’ hands and minds, it’s possible that some kids never read Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol. If you’ve never read this classic, please do so now. You need it.

Back? Good. Fascinating stuff, isn’t it? And so much more accessible than David Copperfield, which was my introduction to Dickens.</description>

      <description>Scrooge’s nephew left the office and let in two men in the process. They came to ask for a donation for London’s poor.
 &amp;ldquo;At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,&amp;rdquo; said the gentleman, taking up a pen, &amp;ldquo;it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.</description>

      <title>A Merry Christmas After All</title>

      <description>We know how the story ends.
 &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s to-day!&amp;rdquo; cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.
&amp;ldquo;EH?&amp;rdquo; returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s to-day, my fine fellow?&amp;rdquo; said Scrooge.
&amp;ldquo;To-day!&amp;rdquo; replied the boy. &amp;ldquo;Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Christmas Day!&amp;rdquo; said Scrooge to himself. &amp;ldquo;I haven&amp;rsquo;t missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night.</description>

      <description>In the course of our lives, we sometimes lose our way. We wander off the good path. Or we fail to blaze the trail we should.

 THE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.
It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand.</description>

      <description>I live in a very hilly area. Yet I’m still alive. Explain that.
Maybe that’s why I’m a lower-case “r” republican and not an upper-case one.
Republicans seem to feel every hill is worth dying on.
What else could explain the House’s rejection of a silly payroll tax cut extension followed by a doubly-damaging capitulation?
By “silly,” I mean ill-advised, inconsequential, irrational, and fiscally irresponsible. The Senate’s two-month extension of the Social Security tax cut represents the worst of Washington.</description>

      <description>When I was a kid, I loved Christmas on Sundays. What I hated were the years before and after the Sunday Christmas.

My problem was I didn’t want to go to Mass two days in a row.
To give some background, I grew up in a Catholic home. Very Catholic. My dad went to Epiphany. My mom’s Catholic, and her dad converted very late in life. Two of my dad’s cousins were Monsignors.</description>

      <title>The Two Key Roles in Social Media Activism *Update*</title>

      <description>Have you ever studied human networks?
I’m not talking about online social networks alone, but any kind of human network.
They’re amazing.

Networks tend to determine who we date, who we marry, and where we work. Our lives are more influenced by networks than we can imagine.
 A network community can be defined as a group of people who are much more connected to one another than they are to other groups of connected people found in other parts of the network.</description>

      <description>The middle of the road is fine until you have to get somewhere.
I voted for Bob Dole in 1996. Yet his nomination drove me away from political activism for years.

I got out of the Navy in the fall of 1994. I watched the GOP reclaim the House with my nephew, Scott. I expected the Republicans to nominate a solid conservative who deliver a knock-out blow to the Clinton era two years later.</description>

      <description>A college student asked me a question: Why join the Tea Party?

He was wondering why anyone would want to associate with people who behaved reprehensibly at two earlier Republican debates.
Here’s how I replied:
 Johnny,
 Sorry that I&amp;rsquo;m just getting to this. I get a lot of email, and sometimes I miss things.
I organized the tea party in St. Louis in 2009. I did so because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that governments accumulate power until they crush liberty and freedom.</description>

      <description>Have you ever thought, “I need to do more for others?”
I have. And I’ve made feeble attempts to satisfy that urge. Feeble.
Still, when I’ve done something “good” for others with no expectation of return, I kind of thump my chest and smile at myself in the mirror like I’m some kind of big shot.
Then my wife introduced me to Valerie Hays, and I realized how much more a person can do.</description>

      <description>We just received this heads up from a friend:
 Just a quick note that Yahoo has apparently changed their &amp;ldquo;Spam&amp;rdquo; firewall rules. You&amp;rsquo;re Tea Party updates have been showing up in my spam box for the past couple days. I can&amp;rsquo;t prove there is a conspiracy, but all of my e-mails from conservative organizations are showing up as spam while a lot of other crap is flying right through. Yahoo mail&amp;rsquo;s spam filter is supposed to be an adaptive process.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine told me this story.
 He sat that there bragging about getting a tax cut for friends of his.
I said, ‘you do realize, don’t you, that you’re just like the Democrats, except you’re giving taxpayers money to a different special interest.’
He looked at me and said, ‘but our special interests do good with the money.’
 My friend was talking about the second highest-ranking Republican in the Missouri House at the time.</description>

      <description>The Washington Post’s headline writer made a common mistake on Sunday.

He confused “one who apologizes” with “apologist.”
An easy mistake, no doubt, for most of us. Professional headline writers should know better. So should Glenn Kessler, the author of the WP story.
 The claim that Obama is an apologist for the nation began to take shape shortly after he became president.
 An apologist is “one who speaks or writes in defense of someone or something.</description>

      <description>Gloria in excelsis Deo. Et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis.
 The English version of the Roman Catholic Missal changed at the start of Advent. The new translation is truer to the Latin original.

The response to “The Lord be with you,” change to “And with your spirit” from “and also with you.” The Latin, et cum spiritu tuo translates exactly into “and with your spirit.”
Another change that thrills conservative Catholics, is the consecration.</description>

      <description>Tuesday in Kansas, President Barack Obama revealed his contempt for liberty. He declared that human beings are incapable of running their own lives . . . but, somehow, other, superior human beings are capable of running their own and others’.
  He said that free markets have always failed, everywhere . . . ignoring most of the last 240 years.
He all but declared himself a Marxist.
I am depressed that America let this dangerous man into our government.</description>

      <description>Yes, the establishment wants you to go away.
Are you going to obey?

With a little help from The Atlantic and New York Times (of all places), we can put together a strategy to recognize and deflect the establishment’s tactics.
Put this in your back pocket. You’ll need it before primary season is over.
Establishment Tactic 1: Never admit membership in the establishment
How To Handle: Never argue about what he establishment is.</description>

      <description>Sometimes the right path is the easy path.
Then the alarm goes off, and we get up to face the world.
When we first met in February 2009, we set ourselves on a course. We dedicated ourselves to, in Buckley’s words, stand athwart history, yelling “STOP!”
But we promised ourselves and the world even more. We committed to reversing the neglect and abuse that’s stained our liberty for more than half a century.</description>

      <description>A few years ago, Malcolm Gladwell wrote an awesome article for The New Yorker: How David Beats Goliath. Read it after you read this.
The story encourages and frustrates at the same time.
Encourages because we learn Davids can, occasionally, beat Goliaths. Frustrates because Goliaths tend to change the rules just before the epic battle.

That’s how the establishment wins—by establishing the rules. And changing them as necessary. Not exactly fair, but fairness isn’t in the rule book.</description>

      <description>The Gipper didn’t always follow his own commandment.
I’ve appreciated Newt Gingrich’s attitude during the 398 Republican Presidential debates. You know, his approach of refusing to attack his opponents.
He will, necessarily, change that approach a bit on the stump, but it’s been very effective so far. As Gingrich might put it, anyone on this stage will do a better job than Barack Obama.
And he’d be right.
But being right about that doesn’t mean candidates don’t have an obligation to show voters why they’re preferable to their opponents.</description>

      <description>Some center-right people take their ball and go home. Guess who?

Since the 2010 election, we’ve heard from the Establishment (GOP, MSM, DNC) that Tea Partiers are too puritanical.
The elitist theory holds that Tea Partiers demand doctrinaire allegiance to some engraved-granite list of principles. Stray from that list, and the Tea Party will hunt you down like a dog in the street and beat you with a Wiffle Ball bat until you pee blood for a week.</description>

      <description>I hear about it all the time. People are frustrated with me. With St. Louis Tea Party.
  They&amp;rsquo;re frustrated because they hear about our events after the events.
That&amp;rsquo;s no good. We want people at the events. That&amp;rsquo;s what makes them events.
**What you asked for was some way to get a phone call about upcoming events. **
That&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable. The question is, how are we going to pay for it?</description>

      <description>The quality of the answers you get in life depend on the quality of the questions you ask.
  
Sometimes, though, when offered the chance to ask important questions, we ask questions about personal gain or immediate problems. That&amp;rsquo;s natural. Our brains are wired to prompt us with the urgent, immediate things in our lives.
But sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s not the best strategy. Sometimes we need answers to the bigger questions&amp;ndash;questions that may be crucial later.</description>

      <description>Like the Penn State athletic department, most St. Louis news media covered up a sex crime in order to protect an organization they love.
The St. Louis Post Dispatch, KTVI 2 and KPLR 11, and KSDK 5 each failed to report a sexual assault that took place at the illegal OccupySTL squatters&amp;rsquo; village in Kiener Plaza last week.
The assault came to light only because a citizen-journalist, the POed Patriot, monitors the police crime map.</description>

      <description>Just over a decade ago, a little lightning in New Mexico upended the cell phone business. Nature, not government, picked winners and losers. That storm determined the cell phone device race until another dynamo, the iPhone, came along and changed everything again.
Now, weather in Thailand&amp;ndash;and the tsunami in Japan&amp;ndash;threaten to upend American politics in the 2012. Your economic future could hang in the balance.

      <description>Have you known anyone who turned his life around?
I was in New York last week. Every day I was there, I passed hundreds of people. Each day, I met a dozen new friends. Everyone in New York, it seems, is ready to smile and have a conversation.
I thought about some of these people&amp;ndash; the young couple holding hands, the young man with a hoodie a dozen tattoos, the two models (I was in that part of town) sitting in the hotel lobby talking on their cell phones.</description>

      <description>America has but one political party capable of winning races on a scale large enough to change government practices: the Republican Party.
When the GOP takes Washington (or Jefferson City), things don&amp;rsquo;t seem to get better. Wonder why?
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a little stroll down memory lane.
 &amp;ldquo;To secure the nomination, the Dewey forces spent money and made deals and promises that Taft would never make. Offers were made of Federal jobs that Delegates could not resist.</description>

      <description>Writers are always looking for the perfect topic for a book. But there’s a problem.
What’s important to me may not be important to you. And what you to read about, I might not care about.
That’s why great books achieve a certain universality. They touch on the essence of life itself, of humanity itself, of existence.
Some say that the secret to perfectly spellbinding stories is a mixture of just three elements: sex, food, and spirit.</description>

      <description>The Tea Party movement faces its greatest danger right now. The future of this country, therefore, straddles a sharp and angry line. One wrong move and everything that we’ve built over the past two and half years will collapse around us.

Occupy Wall Street is a communist idea built on the very same factors that inspired the Tea Party movement. If Tea Partiers let their disdain for the messenger distort our message, the American experiment will end.</description>

      <description>Do conservative politicians believe in America and in liberty? Or do they believe in their own grand plans? We&amp;rsquo;re about to find out.
With Christie out of the race, the money will flood toward the establishment guy, Romney. In other words, the race will be over before Thanksgiving. Romney will be the GOP candidate. Whether he beats Obama is a coin flip.
Romney will in the nomination, unless conservatives put country before pride.</description>

First, my mom and dad celebrate their wedding anniversary this week. (62nd?) Second, my wife and I celebrate our wedding anniversary this week. Third, next week is my birthday.</description>

      <description>Herman Cain is riding a wave of popularity because of his upset win in the Florida straw poll on Saturday. He’s helped by Rick Perry’s free-fall and Mitt Romney’s establishmentarianism. But Cain is a huge underdog.
That’s okay because **America loves an underdog. **
Here’s what must happen right now for Herman Cain to win:
1. Social Media avalanche. Get @THEHermanCain trending on Twitter, and keep it there for five consecutive days.</description>

      <description>In 2001, I loaded my three boys, ages 13, 10, and 8 at the time, into the car and headed to downtown St. Louis. The Cubs were in town, and I planned to introduce my boys to the greatest rivalry in pro sports. We parked (for twenty dollars) and headed toward the stadium.
There was only one problem: we didn’t have any tickets. I planned to buy some on the street.</description>

Before we go into that, hear me out on the pressure on those candidates.

Well, not all. some if it’s my fault, but in a very innocent way.
Planning The After Party
Eisenhower said that planning is essential, but plans are useless. He was right.
When we were planning The After Party, we figured about 50, maybe 75, people would attend at each one.</description>

You probably realize that I have to be really sick to miss a party. Actually, I don’t feel so bad right now, but I don’t want to spread this to the most important people in America. And for the next 12 months, at least, that’s you: the most important people in America.</description>

      <description>When Jay Nixon decided to ignore the voters, ignore the Missouri Constitution, and ignore the power of the legislature, he spit in our faces. But why?
Maybe because his special session is failing.
Maybe because, to save the centerpiece of that legislation, House Speaker Steve Tilley needed protection from the grass roots.
Maybe because Jay Nixon is as crooked as a dog’s hind leg and doesn’t give a hoot about you, your state, your country, or the law.</description>

I have. They remind me of several things. My Uncle Patrick Mahon, for one. Uncle Pat and I watched M_A_S*H reruns every day at 4:00 when I was a kid. We met at my Aunt Mame’s house (unwed sister to Pat and my mom). Uncle Pat drank coffee—usually black with sugar—and smoked unfiltered cigarettes.
Uncle Pat retired from the St. Louis Fire Department in about 1976 (rough guess).</description>

When Mark Gillar of Tea Party Power Hour asked me to come onto his show, I broke my rule. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.
First, Mark Gillar&amp;rsquo;s professionalism and sincerity are spectacular. His show is his mission to advance liberty and good government.
Second, Tea Party Power Hour has hosted some amazing guests&amp;ndash;folks I&amp;rsquo;m very honored and very humbled to follow.</description>

      <description>Dig this opening paragraph –&amp;gt;
 As the marathon for the presidency, 1980, begins to quicken, the American electorate is in a singularly sour and pessimistic mood. Not only is the public naturally worried about the economy, energy and inflation, but it doubts things will improve much. The country is anxious to find strong leaders —the evidence is overwhelming—and the public has little faith that Jimmy Carter has the ability, let alone the programs, to solve the nation&amp;rsquo;s problems.</description>

And you know, there is only one way to beat and win that war. The one thing about Tea Party people is we like a good fight. And you know what? They&amp;rsquo;ve got a war, they got a war with us and there&amp;rsquo;s only going to be one winner.</description>

      <description>Maureen Dowd’s having trouble slathering make-up on her favorite pigs these days. Her President—the man for whom she surrendered all pretense of intelligence, wisdom, and self-control—is flailing.
And Maureen Dowd is going all wobbly. Wobbly on Obama. Wobbly on America. Wobbly on life. Here’s an exceprt:
 On the razor’s edge of another recession; blocked at every turn by Republicans determined to slice him up at any cost; starting an unexpectedly daunting re-election bid; and puzzling over how to make a prime-time speech about infrastructure and payroll taxes soar, maybe President Obama is wishing that he had thrown the game.</description>

      <description>Aerotropolis is a pretty obvious attempt to shift tax money into the pockets of Jefferson City favorites. It&amp;rsquo;s an example of crony capitalism at its worst.
Now,KMOV Channel 4&amp;rsquo;s Craig Cheatham shines the light on the people buying and selling St. Louis in this series. Not just Aerotropolis, but the whole oligarchy of incompetent, corrupt, and self-serving Boss Hog-types who seem bent on reducing the St. Louis region to irrelevance.</description>

If you want to stop the slide into irrelevancy (and the Tea Party movement is far down that path), then pay attention.
If, however, you like the screaming in wilderness, stop reading now. This post is for those who want to continue the mission set forth in February 2009.</description>

I heard Senator Schmidt on KMOX a couple of weeks ago. He scoffed at the Show-Me Institute’s analysis of available warehouse space for China Hub saying that to use existing space would be like building F-16s in the Wright Brothers’ hangar.</description>

      <description>Ed Martin spoke the the Tenth Amendment Center’s Nullification conference in Kansas City. This is a remarkable description of the problem, the dangers, and the solutions of political seduction and abuse of power.
Ed Martin at Nullify Now conference in Kansas City, MO
One point that I should have made before being prompted by Ed’s speech. Trading Missouri sovereignty for a few pieces of ObamaCare silver is simple cowardice. Governor Nixon, and any Republican who voted for the healthcare exchange, should be retired—on their own or in a primary.</description>

      <description>Martin Baker, candidate for Missouri’s 1st Congressional District, lays it on the line,   challenging Tea Party critics Maxine Waters and Frederica Wilson.
Read Martin’s challenge:
 Today, I am inviting both of these distinguished ladies to St Louis, Missouri to tell me and my Tea Party compatriots in person why we should go straight to Hell. Congresswoman Waters should know the way here, having been born and raised in our esteemed area and a graduate of Vashon High School, which is in the St Louis Public School District.</description>

      <description>Wisconsin The boards at Democratic Underground crackled on June 12.
 It was just announced in Wisconsin that the unprecedented recall elections of Republicans will take place August 9.
 The leftists dreamed. Visions of a union-boss oligarchy danced in their heads. Posters misquoted Marx and Lenin. Others wanted nothing to do with waiting two months for an election: they were ready to take up arms and violently overthrow the Wisconsin government.</description>

      <description>Warren Buffett makes the erroneous claim that he pays less in taxes than does his secretary. He claims that the government thus “coddles” the rich. He asks the government to increase his taxes, and the taxes of others like him, as if he is incapable of doing that on his own.
Buffett is half right. He proves that government coddles people by** asking the government to solve his problem of guilt**.</description>

      <description>This weekend, MoveOnUp.org held its first conference. The location was the Crowne Plaza Hotel at the airport. The event launched the Sherman T. Parker Scholarship for African-American Political Science students.
But that’s not the big story.
The big story is this: MoveOnUp.org has cheated history.
Why “cheated?” Because the past 50 years of American liberal history has prepared American blacks for one purpose: compliance.
Using victimhood, welfare, crime, destructive education, and programs designed to destroy families, American liberals from Ted Kennedy to Barack Obama chained African-Americans to “Uncle Sam’s Plantation,” as Star Parker so aptly puts it.</description>

  That&amp;rsquo;s Andrew Breitbart&amp;rsquo;s commitment to African-American conservatives meeting at the Crowne Plaza Hotel at the airport in St. Louis, Missouri, yesterday.
The three-day &amp;ldquo;Meet Me in the &amp;lsquo;Lou&amp;rdquo; conference is the work of the remarkable people at MoveOnUp.org. Today&amp;rsquo;s day two, and Breitbart is the luncheon speaker.
MoveOnUp.org represents the people that the Civil Rights Industry never wants you to meet: black conservatives, escapees from what Star Parker calls &amp;ldquo;Uncle Sam&amp;rsquo;s Plantation.</description>

      <description>Rule by the cleverest brute dominated most of human history. Then came the bizarre notion – in Greece and Rome to degrees, but mostly in the USA – of rule by the governed.
Rule by the governed gave way in 20th century to rule by experts.
Many so called “conservatives” warned against the expert thing. Eventually, conservatives believed, the experts would either fall prey to the clever brutes or to a world too complex for a small group to manage.</description>

Flasback to May 23 of this year. That’s when Barack Obama made the surprise announcement that he would begin accelerated troop withdrawals in July. That timetable meant beginning the withdrawal during the summer fighting season.
Current and former military experts advised the president against this reckless move.</description>

      <description>Answer: Bondbonds.
Sometimes the only option is humor. Maybe it’s time to laugh . . . at ourselves, at our pre-occupations, and at our president.
We elected him. And, in a republic, you always get the leadership you deserve.
Now what?
Now focus. Public displays of anger only hurt us. Anger is a tactic.
Yes, I’m angry. Furious. But acting out on anger does us no good. Instead, wise men and women focus that anger into a steely resolve to electorally destroy the cretins that destroyed America’s credit rating, liberty, and economy.</description>

      <description>It’s not the Balanced Budget Amendment, though that’s a good second choice.
It’s certainly not senseless and impossible ideas like impeaching Obama or suing over birth certificates.
Instead, we should push an idea that’s ripe for quick passage. It’s an idea that cheers political moderates and conservatives. And it doesn’t immediately turn off liberals.
What is it?
It’s an old idea that Jack Kemp championed for decades. It’s an idea that I’ve written about many times before.</description>

      <description>There’s hysteria on both sides. From Satan Sandwiches to “killing future generations,” you’d think Congress is voting on a bill to launch the US nuclear arsenal on Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.
There are reasons to distrust the deal. I distrust it.
There are great reasons todistrust the Congressional committee charged with finding more cuts.
The bill does far too little, too slowly, to prevent a credit rating cut in the near future.</description>

      <description>Yes, the Tea Party movement influenced what went on in Washington.
No, the Tea Party is not the winner. (No one won.)
No, this debt deal won’t guide the government off the road toward bankruptcy. Here’s why.
  No Entitlement Fix: In fact, it appears that entitlements aren’t touched. Entitlements are the nation’s spending problem. Not roads and bridges, not the military. Entitlements. Until we arrest and reverse growth in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, we’re spitting in the ocean.</description>

      <description>Our present crisis is the result of:
** Too much borrowing ** Too much spending ** Too much government control ** Too much taxing
Those who argue that America needs to borrow, spend, regulate, and tax more are simply wrong, wrong, wrong. Their argument is absurd on its face.
The way to increase revenue to government is to increase the economic activity of the people. You do that by giving the people maximum control over their destinies.</description>

 Really? The man who dug a deeper debt hole in two years than anyone else did in 8—or 15—is willing to borrow more?
Say it ain’t so.
For those who believe Obama’s some sort of deficit hawk, let’s take a quick stroll down memory.

Dana Loesch is a champion of liberty, the conservative grassroots, and everything else we stand for. And she’s a great friend to me, to the Tea Party, and, in a sense, to all of us.

Mike Flynn, the editor of Big Government, has quietly (and not so quietly) led the fight for liberty and good government for decades. His Big Government site has been a backbone in the resurgence of our first principles.
Much more importantly to me, Mike Flynn is a friend of mine.</description>

      <description>Your FICO score is a number between 380 and 820 (or something like that) that banks use to determine your credit worthiness. The higher your FICO score, the better.
But that’s not what I’m talking about here.
I’m talking about your FICA score.

Your FICA score is the minimum payment on your federal loan.
You didn’t know you had a federal loan? You do.

      <description>I’ll be honest with you: I’ve lied.
Usually out of desperation. I’ve lied to those closest to me—those most willing to forgive the thing I lied about.
I’ve also told the truth to my own detriment. In the long run, the latter works best. In fact, telling the truth works best in the short run, too.
So maybe Obama’s desperate. Maybe he knows that the debt ceiling debate is the beginning of the unraveling of Americum Sovieticum, his life-long dream.</description>

      <description>Obama showed his breaking point today. The stress got to him.
Today Obama threatened to stop Social Security payments if Congress doesn’t bend to his will on the debt ceiling.
The president told reporters that there may not be enough money to pay Social Security benefits on and after August 3rd.
But the President lies.
Revenue from taxes and other fees would cover Social Security and other payments. What won’t be covered is additional borrowing to service the country’s already outrageous debt.</description>

      <description>With the debt ceiling negotiations closing in, it’s worth looking to Thomas Jefferson.

Jefferson was very opposed to federal government borrowing. (He was less concerned with states borrowing.) What I love about the quote below is Jefferson’s concern for leisure time.
 &amp;ldquo;To preserve [the] independence [of the people,] we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.</description>

      <description>Roy Blunt has not given an inch in thebattle over the debt ceiling. He deserves high praise for his resolve.
During the 2010 Republican primary, many on the right questioned Blunt&amp;rsquo;s fiscal conservative credentials. As a member of the House, Blunt had helped craft some and pass unpopular spending bills, including TARP. On theissue of debt and responsibility, though, he shows no sign of cracking.
  Government debt is the defining issue of our time, perhaps of the American experiment.</description>

      <description>July 4, 2011, felt hollow, like celebrating the birthday of someone deceased.
Independence Day celebrates the birth of an idea: that people create governments and empower them, not the other way around.
Do we still believe that?

Yes, I still believe that. Morally, at least. And you probably do, too.
Does America still believe that government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed? Or do we, as a nation, believe that government has a monopoly on liberty and dispenses it at its will?</description>

      <description>A Harvard study recently concluded that attending American Independence Day celebrations could turn kids into Republicans.

The reason 4th of July creates Republicans has nothing to do with patriotism and everything to do with education. Here’s why:
* On July 4th, we celebrate the Declaration of Independence, not the founding of the United States. (That would come with the passage of the Constitution thirteen years later).** July 4th events teach kids—in an environment free from teacher-union propaganda—the _reasons_ we broke from England.</description>

      <description>I was 18 and a college freshman. It was a Tuesday night in October. My 1970 Chevy Impala felt wide open in the fifty-degree air and the smell of freshly fallen leaves.
I drove through Forest Park feeling the rhythm of the yellow street lights as I moved between light and dark. &amp;ldquo;Memory&amp;rdquo; from Cats came on the radio. I lit a Camel (no filter).
I was free.

In America, we often think of independence as a collective thing.</description>

      <description>The tram cars are tiny, metal containers. Passengers&amp;ndash;six to a car&amp;ndash;sit cramped on molded plastic seats. The air inside the cars is stale and hot. There is no air conditioning.
The trams take you to the top of the 632 foot Gateway Arch in St. Louis. The uncomfortable ride takes only a few minutes.
Except when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.
Sometimes things go wrong, as they did this week. Forty people were trapped for an hour.</description>

Even though they became ubiquitous when he was an undergrad,Obama just now discovered that ATMs reduce foot traffic in banks. Then again, they probably didn&amp;rsquo;t have the machines in the Kremlin where he spent his semester abroad.
But the twits are sure having a blast with the news (me included).
Exit question: you think ATMs and airport kiosks are preventing people from finding work?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rdquo; could refer to anything. Anything at all.
In this case, though, I&amp;rsquo;m referring to unemployment. Well, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m referring to the economy overall.
Unemployment rate rises to 9.1%, 54K jobs added « Hot Air
Obama has increased regulation, seized entire industries (auto, student loans, commercial banking, medicine), and borrowed more money faster than all previous presidents combined.
Obama is a one-dictator disaster. And an incompetent one at that.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a job, Obama made it worse.</description>

Please Consider
I’ve met the former Missouri GOP head and former US Ambassador to Luxembourg a couple of times. Ann Wagner is smart, funny, and engaging. I think she’d make an outstanding Republican candidate for the US House. If elected, she’d serve Missouri well.
Missouri and the tea party won’t be the big winners if Ann Wagner gets the nomination, though. That distinction would go to the Missouri Republican establishment—the same establishment that the tea party hopes to reform or replace.</description>

      <description>There’s a “special” school in St. Louis County. Its seniors graduated on last Friday.

How sad it must be for those kids. They’re not graduating from the district’s “normal” schools with their peers. For various reasons, they’ve been relegated to a school for misfits.
Seeing the building makes the bad feelings worse. It’s a former grade school, crammed inconveniently behind a bank and a Taco Bell. Its Eisenhower era architecture stands out amidst its Mortgage Boom surroundings like a dandelion on golf course.</description>

Brooks wrote of The Missing Fifth. **Did you know that 20 percent of American men in their primes don’t work? **
 Americans should be especially alert to signs that the country is becoming less vital and industrious. One of those signs comes to us from the labor market.</description>

      <description>The University of Missouri St. Louis uses tax dollars to provide a recruiting station for the Communist Party USA—an organization whose purpose is to shred the United States Constitution.
UMSL Student Philip Christofanelli heroically chronicles the remarkable Marxist indoctrination known as “Introduction to Labor Studies” on BigGovernment.com. I’ll give you a taste:
 Prof. Giljum then introduced Tony Pecinovsky, a local organizer for the Communist Party, who proceeded to speak to us for two hours about the beliefs of the Communist Party and the benefits of membership.</description>

Since Ollie North&amp;rsquo;s testimony to Congress during the Iran-Contra Hearings in the Reagan Administration, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working toward this one man&amp;rsquo;s death.

But Gail Hackett refuses to answer hard questions.
I have one question for the UMKC Provost: ****
**Do you agree with Don Giljum’s statement “I believe in a violent overthrow of Bourgeois?” **
Before you answer, remember that Giljum’s use of the personal term “Bourgois” instead of the the class “bourguoisie” indicates that Giljim believes in violence against individual members of the middle class.</description>

First, KMOX is reporting that an UMSL professor has resigned** over the controversy**. For the life of me, I cannot find who the professor is. I thought that everyone involved was either an instructor or a guest lecturer. If you know the answer to the riddle, please use the comment form.

      <description>I’m going to ask you to melt phones in Jefferson City, UMSL, UMKC, and Mizzou. I’m asking you to do this today and tomorrow. I’m following up with an email to you.
It’s sad that our state’s premier University System has fallen so far.

What does it take to get your attention? What does it take to get you to act?
Your University of Missouri System humiliates this state, and you refuse to act.

That’s right, UMSL and UMKC are teaching kids how to destroy business in America. They want your job to go overseas. And the guy leading the class is a proud communist.

I’m not a “big tent” guy. To me, “big tent” means we’ll keep adding on beliefs (or abandoning them) until no one disagrees with us. In other words, **“big tent” means pretending to enjoy the beatings we’re given. **
“Big tent” is Republican for “surrender.” It’s not for me.
What is for me is broadening and building the base. Let me explain.</description>

      <description>And, he’s back.
Missouri House Speaker Steve Tilley (R-Perryville) has signed onto legislation designed to circumvent the Electoral College in presidential elections. Like his position on embryonic stem cell research and the national debt, Tilley seems far out of step with Missouri’s Republican base on this. And this guy wants to be Lt. Governor? Please.
This might be old news to some.

      <description>Patrick Tuohey made some good points about the office of Lieutenant Governor. Based on that, I thought up all the possible reasons someone would run for LooeyG.
1. Stepping Stone: Establish state-wide name recognition and give yourself plenty of time to run for that next office, like U.S. Senate or Governor.
2. Party Reptile: If the governor is or is likely to be of the opposite party, you get to be the de facto head of your party in the state.</description>

      <description>Let’s face it: the Missouri GOP has become a club to advance the careers of a select few favorites. It is not a party to advance conservative principles.
And that needs to change here and now.
And that means some old names need to retire.
Here’s just one example of the ideological impotence of the Missouri Republican Party: The St. Louis County Assessor.
The GOP created the St. Louis County Assessor’s office because of corruption and incompetence in the political patronage version of the office under Democrats Buzz Westfall and Charlie Dooley.</description>

State Senators Jim Lembke (@jimlembke), Brian Nieves (@briannieves), Rob Schaaf (@robschaaf), and Will Kraus stood for principle. And the left immediately went berserk.
The collectivists—those who hate personal achievement and fiscal responsibility in government—will target these men. We must have their backs.

Jake Zimmerman’s campaign rotates two themes:
  The St. Louis County Assessor should be a career political hack, not a seasoned real estate professional
  His little old friend, Margaret, is in danger of losing her home.
  But mostly St. Louis County government needs more Democrat political hacks.
Turns out that, just like Jake’s dad, his friend Margaret, a rather unsuccessful real estate investor, got a break on her property taxes.</description>

The rest of Jake Tapper’s story gets more disturbing.
* The President and the Defense Secretary seem to disagree on national interest** The Secretary of State cannot articulate a consistent US policy** Hillary Clinton seems to believe that the UN is a legal alternative to the US Congress  More than week into a war that lacks even the thinnest thread of Constitutionality, Barack Obama seems clueless.</description>

      <description>Register today for Vacation Liberty School. Here&amp;rsquo;s 3 reasons why you should:
 Most school systems don&amp;rsquo;t care about liberty; they care about conformity. The only way kids will learn an appreciation for the blessings of libertyis if their parents send them to schools that put liberty at the center of the cirriculum. That&amp;rsquo;s what Vacation Liberty School does.
  Many teachers would love to teach more about the blessings of liberty to their skulls full of mush, but they can&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

Previously, she had charged taxpayers some of the cost of operating her private plane. Before that, it seems, she registered the plane in property tax-free Delaware.
On Monday, Claire wrote a $287,000 check without batting an eye. Now, St. Louis County says she owes them another $33,000 in interest and penalties, for a total bill of $320,000.</description>

The image of a cowardly and selfish child-president flying to Brazil to launch a war will haunt his legacy, like Nixon’s vulgarities on tape in 1974. Obama’s war on Libya has doomed an already weak administration.
Today, Germany pulled out of NATO because of the bungled, late, and idiotic intervention. It appears, now, that the alliance that won the Cold War and help sustain two decades of peace could collapse under a lack of American leadership.</description>

      <description>What many people don&amp;rsquo;t get is that cooperation is not the same as consensus.

Cooperation means someone takes the lead on an issue. If it makes sense, and if the leader is perceived to have good character and judgment, others follow. Otherwise, the project is stillborn. It&amp;rsquo;s the way the market picks leaders. Not through org charts, but through action and response.
One person may be the leader on one issue and a cooperator on many others.</description>

      <description>When the US invaded Iraq in 2003, it do so with the clear intent of bringing its enemy—Saddam’s regime—to an unconditional surrender. That was the objective. Despite what happened after that objective was achieved, we went in with a clear and measurable purpose.
The motivating reason for our foray into Iraq was also clear. We believed at the time that Saddam Hussein’s possession of &amp;ndash; and desire for more &amp;ndash; weapons of mass destruction posed an imminent threat to US interests and citizens.</description>

It’s bad enough that corruption, nepotism, and Machiavellian favoritism runs rampant in St. Louis County. What’s worse is that Dooley doesn’t seem to care what anyone thinks.
 St. Louis County in the third year of a hiring and pay freeze, Mike Temporiti landed a $70,000 county job.
. . .
The job was never posted, and Temporiti did not have to interview for it.</description>

      <description>According to a book by historians Neil Howe and William Strauss, history follows a fairly predictable pattern, rotating in cycles equal to a long human life. The book, The Fourth Turning, was written in 1997.
Read it.
If Howe and Strauss are right—and so far, they’re dead on—then we recently entered a Fourth Turning in the current saeculum which they named “millennium.”
What is a Fourth Turning?
 The Fourth Turning is a Crisis, a decisive era of secular upheaval, when the values regime propels the replacement of the old civic order with a new one.</description>

      <description>“Why would a nation become imperial?,” Steven asked me. “I mean, why would you want to take that on?”
The conversation had been on Japan leading up to World War II. The question was important. Why would a nation conquer dissimilar nations? Why accept that burden and risk?
My answer, which I’ve grown more fond of as time’s passed, was something like this: Imperial people view everything as a fixed pie.</description>

Turns out Gen X was one of the most productive generations in a long while. Then Gen Y just went off and fought two wars for us.
Historian Neil Howe points us to today’s Happy Hour: a Millennial elected to Michigan’s state assembly last November.

      <title>3 Steps to Happiness and Success</title>

      <description>Some of the biggest potholes on the road to happiness come from bad advice from self-help “experts.”
But here are three scientifically proven steps to being happier. And since happiness causes success in other areas, not the other way around, these could be the most important tasks you perform.
Give Thanks
People who write down three things they’re grateful for and the reason those things happened show a 50 percent drop in medical claims over six months compared to a control group who journaled about nothing in particular (Emmons &amp;amp; McCullough).</description>

      <description>Doing the right thing is hard.
Doing the right thing after years of practicing the wrong things is even harder.
  When your senate separated the fiscal responsibility provisions affecting union collective bargaining powers from a bill that previously included tax and spend provisions, you took a big step toward fiscal recovery.
For years, public sector unions have dictated states’ taxing spending policies through brute force. These unions were not elected by the people, but the people were forced to pay—or borrow—what the unions demanded.</description>

This time, you and I have the job to elect Chip Wood for County Assessor.* Here’s why.
In 2010, voters created an elected assessor’s office in St. Louis County. The Republicans pushed for this new office because of corruption, abuse, and waste in the County Assessor’s office under Charlie Dooley.</description>

      <description>I’ve written about this before.
The problem with traffic signals is that they make all of the problems they’re designed to solve worse. By “all the problems” I mean: * Pollution * Congestion * Deaths * Accidents * Speed of Transit * Risk to pedestrians (except those with certain disabilities)
Banning red light cameras is a great first step, but the ultimate goal should be elimination of traffic lights altogether.</description>

      <description>The federal budget deficit in the month of February 2011 exceeds the deficit for all of 2007 by 40 percent.
Simply staggering.
Yet Senate Democrats refuse to cut more than a paltry $6 billion. They refuse because they seem bent on collapsing the American system – the economy, the government, and the people themselves.
But at least the Obama administration stands by with its arms folded as gasoline prices skyrocket at the their fastest pace in history.</description>

Hook of Missouri Watchdog, McCaskill gave Democrats a set of instructions very similar to those I usually give at the end of Tea Party rallies. (Only Claire’s instructions seem a bit less human than mine.)
Some national political scientists believe McCaskill’s Senate seat is one of the most vulnerable in 2012.</description>

 Major props to Brian Nieves and Jim Lembke for their continued commitment to conservatism in the MO Senate with HB 163 - refusing federal funds for another unemployment extension that costs taxpayers $81 million. They&amp;rsquo;re standing their ground against some of their fellow GOP who need to be reminded what fiscal conservatism is.</description>

What do I mean by that?
Look at what’s going on in Wisconsin. The people who represent the net tax payers—those who pay more in taxes to the state than they receive in salary—are being vilified, harassed, threatened, and assaulted by the net tax takers—those receive more in state wages than they pay in state taxes.</description>

      <description>I continue hearing reliable reports that the GOP Leadership in the Missouri House keeps its boot on the throat of Tea Party freshmen.
What a shame.
The party that was flat on its back from 2006 to 2009 rose back to power because of the tea party. But, it seems, the Missouri branch of the party didn’t get the message. And its Speaker in the Missouri House has become tighter with left-fringe Democrats that with conservatives of his own party.</description>

The National Education Association is a radical, political organization whose primary purpose is not education but control.

The solution is simple. Do what Reagan did to PATCO.</description>

      <description>You can’t call yourself a conservative and ask for education money from Washington.
Republicans dominate both houses of the Missouri legislature. You’d think they’d act like republicans (lower case). But when it comes to education bribes from Washington, many of our Republican legislators show little resistance to political seduction. We can help them.
On BigGovernment. com, Bob McCarty highlights the hypocrisy of blasting ObamaCare from one side of the mouth while begging for federal cash out of the other.</description>

      <description>Those who blindly cheer for the fall of Mubarak and the rise of anything else in Egypt are the same as those who cheered the fall of the Shah in Iran. Question their motives.
The Great One, Mark Levin, tweeted attention to this post about an email from Salim Mansur to Claire Berlinski. The email’s purpose was to call Claire’s attention to Mansur’s latest column.
Here’s what Mansur says as an aside:</description>

      <description>I’m torn.
  Yesterday, I took part in a demonstration outside Senator Claire McCaskill’s St. Louis office on Delmar. The future of the republic is important. We are concerned that Senator McCaskill put her re-election before Missouri jobs by lobbying the DNC to hold its 2012 convention in Charlotte, NC, instead of St. Louis, MO.
Down the road, a group of Cardinals fans held a demonstration outside Busch Stadium. The future of future Hall of Famer Albert Pujols is important, too.</description>

      <description>The incompetent Sheriff Dupnik of Pima County Arizona has intimidated speakers in an attempt to shut down the Tucson Tea Party.
Now, Tucson’s asking for our help. Jennifer Humphries wrote to Gateway Pundit Jim Hoft. She asked Jim of his help defending the First Amendment rights of the people of Tucson. Those rights are under assault from an incompetent and irresponsible sheriff who has now turned to intimidation to silence dissent.</description>

      <description>Pro-Western governments in these countries have fallen to anti-American forces or diminished their support for the US since Barack Obama became president.
* Lebanon** Jordan** Yemen** Qatar** Egypt** Turkey  Obama’s campaign promise to restore respect for America around the world is a joke. A cruel and dangerous joke. Our enemies see Obama’s weakness as American weakness. As they did during Jimmy Carter’s failed presidency, those enemies are advancing.
The next president will have more than a financial catastrophe to fix.</description>

      <description>Since mass murderer Fidel Castro fired thousands of Cuban government workers due to the economic unviability of Obamanomics, those set free are enjoying their independence. To the shock of the New York Times:
 “I feel useful; I’m independent,” said Ms. Álvarez, who opened a small cafe in November at her home in this scruffy town 25 miles from the capital, Havana. “When you sit down at the end of the day and look at how much you have made, you feel satisfied.</description>

      <description>When he identified the three branches of government as President, House, and Senate, Was Chuck Schumer confused, or did he accurately state the Obama administration’s intent to subjugate the Judicial Branch of government? It seems the White House no longer considers the Judicial Branch the equal of the Executive.
In two cases—the Gulf oil drilling ban and Obamacare—the White House refuses to obey ruling from federal judges. In New Orleans, federal judge Martin Feldman found the White House in contempt for its re-imposition of oil drilling bans after his previous ruling to the contrary.</description>

      <description>Did you enjoy President Obama’s gooey nostalgia for the Happy Days of Eisenhower and Howdy Doody as much I did?

Saul Alinsky warned radicals to “never go outside the expertise of your people.” But desperate times call for desperate measures, so Obama jumped the shark to the time of Potsy and Fonzie and Joannie Loves Chachi to rekindle a flavor of Americana that died a couple of years before Obama was born.</description>

      <description>An old boss of mine liked “forcing functions.” Forced us to meet delivery dates, while arbitrary dates tended to cause a “so what” attitude toward deadlines. Forcing functions like trade shows, magazine reviews, and client launches forced development teams to ship, no matter what.
Keep that in mind for a moment while we look at the Obama Administration.
Barack Obama campaigned on a promise to clip America’s wings. I know he didn’t use that term, but it was clear what he meant when he visited the Mediterranean and Germany.</description>

      <description>U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson today ruled Obamacare directly violates the Constitution by mandating that citizens buy health insurance.
This ruling goes further than the previous Virginia ruling. Judge Vinson declared the entire Obamacare bill unconstitutional because the individual mandate portion is not severable from the rest of the law.
Third, Judge Vinson granted the plaintiffs “declaratory relief,” the functional equivalent of an injunction, freeing them from the burden of compliance.</description>

Now that you’re up to date, let me add the Tea Party angle to this.
Though Porter did not dwell on government’s role in Creating Shared Value (CSV), he did point out that government must reform for CSV to succeed.</description>

 Day after day they marched, tens of thousands strong, defiant chanting demonstrators surging through the streets of Cairo, a capital unaccustomed to the shouts and echoes of dissent. The subject of their protest was the policies of Egypt’s supreme ruler, Hosni Mubarak. Some carried signs demanding his ouster. Others called for a return of long denied civil and political liberties and the enforcement of Islamic laws.</description>

      <description>Many of the people who support eliminating state oversight of the St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners are not conservatives. Decidedly not.
There are some good conservatives who disagree over the Board of Police Commissioners for the City of St. Louis. I’ve heard some of these conservative make some strong arguments for abolishing the board or relinquishing it to St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay.
Some of the arguments in favor of so-called “home rule” are flat out false.</description>

In 2005, Reason Magazine posted an online debate between Friedman and Whole Foods Market CEO John Mackey. The debate coincided with the 35th anniversary of Friedmans’ famous The New York Times Magazine article entitled: : &amp;ldquo;The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits.</description>

The speech starts at 8:00 p.m. CT Tuesday, January 25 on KSDK 5.</description>

That said, our marketing to date has been spotty at best and atrocious at worst. We don’t sell ourselves well.
By “marketing,” I don’t mean phoniness or deception. Rather, we must advance those ideas that will do the greatest good or avert the gravest harm.</description>

Suppose you did something stupid. You blamed the wrong person, for instance, for a capital crime. Then supposed one of your comrades compounded your . . . error . . . by threatening to kill someone on national television?
If you’re an American leftist, you might double down by issuing even more death threats to even more people.
That’s what’ happening right now in America. Death threats are pouring into Trent Humphries, Tucson Tea Party organizer, Dana Loesch, Sarah Palin (who vows not to be silenced), Glenn Beck, and more.</description>

Dionne, Paul Krugman, others – have [executed a prepared propaganda war](https://hennessysview.com/crime/a-national-day-of-shame/) against anyone who disagrees with them. Their theorem is: vitriolic rhetoric inspires conservatives to act out in violence.
Unfortunately for the loony left, there was no evidence to support their theorem. The evidence they falsely pointed to—Jarod Lee Loughner’s deranged murder rampage in Tucson—was determined to be a lie only hours after the event.</description>

In response, neighboring states of Wisconsin and Indiana have wisely mounted massive campaigns to suck businesses and people out of Illinois. Even New Jersey’s fabulous governor, Chris Christie, plans to fish the Land o’ Lincoln for some business transplants.
One state bordering Illinois has been notoriously silent.</description>

In 2001, it was the shared leadership arrangement in the Senate, even thought the GOP had the majority because of the VP tie-break. This year, it’s beginning with “bi-partisan” seating at the State of the Union address.
I have one message for Republicans: Knock it the hell off.
When a Democrat offers to reach across the aisle, with very few exceptions, it’s to poison a Republican.</description>

I’ve always known and acknowledged that the people who advocated and plotted to concentrate power in the hands of a few were wicked creatures. I never hesitated to attack them head-on.
But the others. The others I sometimes pitied.</description>

In the memo, obtained by Fox News and posted on Greta Van Susteren’s blog, the DHS agent openly speculates about undue internal influence. That’s because Loughner’s arrests don’t all end with reasonable closure, if you will.
Here’s exactly what the DHS report says:

      <description>How sad is the story of the Tucson tragedy.
Good people died. Good people grieve.
A little girl, born on 9-11, went on her way to her reward. Too soon. So, so too soon.
Experience says that some survivors will become bitter and angry. That’s sad, too.
Some will become depressed.
All will weep. Especially the little girl’s daddy. (I can’t bring myself to write their names—that would make it too personal for me.</description>

      <description>Democrats—from Jane Fonda to Senator Bob Brady of Pennsylvania—are pushing to ban words, phrases, and images they don’t like, as P/Od Patriot points out.
Yes, we are living in very dangerous times. And the danger comes almost exclusively from the left.

      <title>A National Day of Shame</title>

      <description>It’s bad enough that five people died, including a wonderful nine-year-old girl.
It’s bad enough that a dozen or more people were shot.
It’s bad enough that a deranged man attacked our American system.
But America’s liberal elite turned the tragedy into a national day of shame. They accomplished this by callously and capriciously blaming innocent political opponents for the violence. When confronted with facts to the contrary, liberals, including Paul Krugman, CBS News, the New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, Jane Fonda, Sheriff Dupnick of Pima County Arizona, and others, continued to lie, slander, and libel the tea party, Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, and conservatives in general.</description>

      <title>FLASHBACKS: Media Blame Tea Party for Leftist Crimes</title>

      <description>The most often repeated story is not the reluctant hero or the hero who wants to get home. Nor is it about a mother’s love.
The ultimate archetypical story line is:
LIBERAL PRESS ERRONEOUSLY BLAMES TEA PARTY FOR LEFTIST CRIMES
As Jarod Lee Loughner’s political bent emerges, we see the same, predictable story playing out:
1. A horrific crime takes place.*2. Leftist bloggers like Markos Moulitsas blame conservatives.*3. CNN, New York Times, Washinton Post, etc.</description>

      <title>Cowardly, Leftist Punks Go Silent</title>

      <description>The tragedy in Tucson exposed America’s leading leftists for what they are.
Andrew Breitbart points out on Twitter that his cowardly leftist accusors, including Markos Moulitsas and Eric Boehlert, quieted down on their libelous attacks on Breitbart, Palin, Bush, and Tea Party.
These leftist cowards shut up only after it became undeniably clear that the evil bastard who shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 11 others is not a tea partier, but a deranged socialist.</description>

      <title>Alleged Giffords Shooter: Jared Loughner Leaves Video *UPDATES*</title>

      <description>Update: Gateway Pundit has much more on the alleged shooter.
These appear to be the paranoid ramblings of the man in custody for shooting Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 11 others, including a federal judge, in Tucson, AZ. Lots of hard left references in his favorite books, including Mein Kampf and The Communist Manifesto. Politico’s Ben Smith calls Laughner’s writings “socialist.”

      <description>Like all decent people, I am disgusted to hear the sad news out of Tucson, AZ: Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) was shot and killed along with four others today. Twelve were shot altogether. The murderer was apprehended by heroic bystanders and is in custody.
Not sure of the young murderer’s motives. I’m sure they weren’t worth killing or dying for. Except to him.
Please prayer for the souls of the faithful departed, the well-being of their families, the quick recovery of the wounded, and the delivery of justice.</description>

      <description>Momentum is the mass and velocity of an object.
The object is the American ideology.
The impetus is the conservative grassroots.
The velocity is medium.
The direction is right.
The tactics and tools to keep the dominos falling to the right might change, but the energy and ideals don’t. What brought you out to the tea parties, to the street parties, to the lit drops, and to the door knocking and phone banking parties must carry you forward in 2011 and 2012.</description>

      <description>Four years after Nancy Pelosi swore to end deficit spending, a new Congress, elected by a grassroots surge, took office today.
Our work has just begun.
But we have the momentum.
Here’s how we need to deal with Congress:
1. We let them know what’s important to us.
2. We defend them—individually and collectively—when they do the right thing.
3. We remind them of their purpose, promises, and limitations when they stray.</description>

      <title>3 Moves After the Tea Party*</title>

      <description>It’s 2011. The Tea Party movement is almost two years old.
Two years after the Boston Tea party, the Revolutionary War was well underway. In April, 1775, British Lieutenant General Gage sent troops to Concord, Massachusetts, to seize a garrison held by revolutionaries. It didn’t go so well for the Brits.

By 1776, the Continental Congress declared our independence from Great Britain citing human rights. With words that echo through the centuries, we declared that human beings have certain rights, and:</description>

      <description>Clearly a fan of understatement, Ezra Klein once ran a blog called “Not Geniuses.” Now, of course, he demonstrates his ignorance on MSNBC.
Last week, Klein unwittingly advanced the cause of dead constitutions. He did a better job than any proponent could. He said:
 The issue with the Constitution is that the text is confusing because it was written more than a hundred years ago.
 (William F. Buckley once described a statement like Klein’s as evoking of the sort of pity one feels for the ignorance of animals.</description>
