      <title>The Longest Year</title>

      <description>The year that ends tonight didn’t begin a year a go tomorrow. Nor does it have a number.
I’m not sure when this year started or what to call it. And, as surprising as it may sound, I don’t think I’ll miss it.
Call it the year of the tea party. It lasted 22 months.
We accomplished only two things, really, in this massive human wave.
  We reminded ourselves that we, the people, can still roar.</description>

      <title>8 Things to Read in 2011</title>

      <description>This week last year, I read The 5000 Year Leap. Good book. If you haven’t read it, do so. You might learn some interesting things.
But don’t expect The 5000 Year Leap to change you. Or history. It won’t.
Now, if 70 percent of the US population read it, it might make a difference. Or maybe not. I tend to doubt it, but that’s fodder for a different post.
When tea partiers read books like Glenn Beck’s Common Sense or The 5000 Year Leap, we’re not broadening ourselves—we’re narrowing ourselves.</description>

      <title>Despots Use Money to Buy Power</title>

      <description>Politicians don’t seek money. They seek power. They use money to acquire power. Once they have the power, money becomes irrelevant.
Did you see how states behaved last summer? The “Race to the Top” is all you need to know about the relationship between government money, power, and degradation.
The Race to the Top education initiative dangled cash in front of states. Most states, including Missouri, bit. They competed against each other for the privilege of surrendering their sovereignty over education to a DoE overlord.</description>

      <title>Why Don’t We Do Something Else?</title>

      <description>Yes, I read that. And I saw that. And somebody told me about that, too.
I see the ridiculous charges leveled by ignorant bigots against the Tea Party. I hear the slander on MSNBC and CNN. I know that Ben Jealous and Nancy Pelosi live on lies about you and me the way vampires live on human blood.
I get it.
My immediate urge when I read or hear this nonsense is anger.</description>

      <description>This is my opinion, and it’s not all about politics. Nor are they necessarily in any particular order. Save for one. (You’ll see.)
* [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.cnsnews.com/node/55971), [Phil Hare](https://biggovernment.com/publius/2010/04/01/rep-phil-hare-d-il-i-dont-worry-about-the-constitution/), and other Democrats admit their contempt for the US Constitution.** Barack Obama continues [bowing](https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/04/obama_bows_down_to_saudi_king.html) to tin-horn dictators . . . who really are his superiors.** Rep. Russ [Carnahan funnels millions of tax dollars](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=13&amp;amp;ved=0CCsQFjACOAo&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com%2F2010%2F10%2Fthats-weird-state-run-media-reports-on-carnahan-wind-farm-scandal%2F&amp;amp;ei=pLwSTfyxAoXGlQfCxvH6Cw&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGqHk_kEl6bWinUxSTFv6rjDZ8M1g&amp;amp;sig2=OGLfK5UEIUZF1jZDypt1Uw) to his family business.** The business world discovers “[gamification](https://blogs.hbr.org/haque/2010/12/unlocking_the_mayor_badge_of_m.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+harvardbusiness+(HBR.org)),” an idea that will turn marketing upside in 2011.</description>
