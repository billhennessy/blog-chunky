      <description>Scott Adams says Donald Trump lives his life like a movie or television series. (See Looking Ahead to Season Four of Trump for a complete explanation.) Being New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve, it&amp;rsquo;s time to look back on Season Five (2019) and, then, look ahead to season six (2020) of Trump.
Season Five: Mueller Report and Ukraine Hoax Going into 2019, the Fed had slowed the incredible Trump Economy with aggressive interest rate hikes.</description>

      <description>Jerry Garcia Was Wrong
Jerry Garcia of Grateful Dead was famous for saying &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s about the journey, not the destination.&amp;rdquo;
Garcia was wrong.
There are two possible destinations:
 Eternal perfection. Eternal misery.  It&amp;rsquo;s all about the destination. The destination is all that matters.
The journey matters only insofar as it determines the destination. If you know and pursue the right destination, the journey will be difficult, often painful, often lonely, often frustrating.</description>

      <description>A celebrity priest fired up Twitter today by endorsing same-sex &amp;ldquo;marriage&amp;rdquo; and by comparing a same-sex couple favorably to the Holy Family.
Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that the good father is not malicious but so poorly educated into reason and Church teaching that his embarrassing tweets make sense to him. Let&amp;rsquo;s pretend Fr. Sichko thinks he&amp;rsquo;s right.
To help educate the ignorant priest (and educating the ignorant is one of our Christian duties), I&amp;rsquo;ll pose some questions to Fr.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;There’s no point at which you’ve cleaned yourself so well that you never have to shower again.&amp;rdquo;
 —Eric Greitens, Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life&amp;rdquo;
   &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t walk my dog anymore.&amp;rdquo; I walked him all at once.
 — Comedian Steven Wright

      <description>A Frenchman named Michel Chiron was possessed by demons for decades. His story of exorcism revealed something remarkable.
In an interview with Solène Tadié for National Catholic Register, Chiron said the demons possessing him mocked Jesus but feared &amp;ldquo;The Woman.&amp;rdquo;
About Jesus:
 They told me he did exist in the past but that he should be forgotten, as nowadays human beings no longer needed him. They even said that he was with their king now.</description>
