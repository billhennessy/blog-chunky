                            <p>Down in the world&rsquo;s newest socialist &ldquo;paradise,&rdquo; the longest blackout in decades has struck Venezuela. The country has been <a href="http://news.trust.org/item/20190309205620-dfuso">without power for at least 4 days</a>. That&rsquo;s how socialism works.</p>
<p>The constitutional president, Juan Guaido, has called on Venezuelans to pour into the capital city of Caracas to demand the communist dictator Madura surrender. Guaido correctly points out that Maduro&rsquo;s socialism caused the problem.</p>
<p>Guaido&rsquo;s call is great, but it doesn&rsquo;t go far enough. The people of Venezuela should call on special forces help from the Blessed Mother under her title as Our Lady of Fatima. She has a history of thwarting communists.</p>
<p><img src="/images/uploads/our-lady-of-fatima.jpg" alt="Our Lady of Fatima"></p>
<p>But Venezuelans need more than electricity and a new government. They need God, just like we do. And Catholics around the world should help with prayer, at a minimum, because misguided Catholics and their evil &ldquo;liberation theology&rdquo; caused the problem in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="the-church-never-taught-liberation-theology">The Church Never Taught Liberation Theology</h3>
<p>Liberation theology was a KGB invention, and the Catholic Church never taught it. Rogue Catholics and communist infilitraters did.</p>
<p>The goal of liberation theology was to flip Catholic priests and theologians towards Marxism through a perverted theology called &ldquo;liberation theology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the 1960s onward, liberation theology, pushed mainly by Catholic members of the Jesuit order, spread like wildfire throughout Central America and South America. Brazil, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela, and more fell under the spell of pseudo-Catholic Marxism. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/21/magazine/the-case-against-liberation-theology.html">See this 1984 NYTimes article for more.</a></p>
<p>Thanks to God, Pope St. John Paul II put the kibosh on the heresy, and his successor, Pope Benedict XVI, continued the church&rsquo;s rejection of the apostasy. As a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/21/magazine/the-case-against-liberation-theology.html">1984 New York Times article</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the beginning of his pontificate, <strong>Pope John Paul II has built a case against &lsquo;liberation theology.'</strong> He believes that <strong>religion must transcend politics</strong>, and that the primacy of the spiritual can be surrendered by no Christianity worthy of the name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know where Pope Francis lands vis-a-vis liberation theology, but it&rsquo;s safe to assume he&rsquo;s friendlier toward towards that apostasy than any previous pope. As such, <strong>we need to take matters into our own hands</strong>. We can&rsquo;t count on the Vatican to support the people over a communist dictator. We need to repeat the <strong>great, victorious, anti-communist Rosary crusades of the 20th century</strong>. Here are highlights from two of those anti-communist Rosary crusades.</p>
<h3 id="post-war-austria-1947">Post-War Austria, 1947</h3>
<p>The Allies surrendered the most valuable parts of Austria to the Soviet Union as the victors divided the spoils of World War II. This action, in one fell swoop, rescued Vienna from the grips of Nazism and fed it to the evil jaws of Marxism. Not much of a win for the mostly-Catholic Viennese.</p>
<p>What did they do? They conducted a Rosary Crusade. As told by Fr. Donald Calloway in his epic book, <a href="https://www.fathercalloway.com/books-and-gifts/champions-rosary-history-and-heroes-spiritual-weapon"><em>Champions of the Rosary</em></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fr. Pevlicek organized a Holy Rosary Crusade of Reparation in 1947, consisting of the Viennese people conducting a public procession in the streets of their city. The explicit intention for the rosary crusade was to bring about an end to Communism in their country and the entire world . . . By 1955, after eight years of rallying support from among the Austrian people, the public recitation of the rosary drew more than half a million people, equalling one-tenth of the entire population of Austria. <strong>Then, to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, on May 13, 1955, the Soviets announced that they were leaving Austria of their own accord, with the last forces leaving in October of the same year.</strong></p>

<h3 id="brazil-1964">Brazil, 1964</h3>
<p>(Taken from my earlier blog, <a href="https://www.hennessysview.com/2018/11/04/election-day-spiritual-warfare/">Election Day Spiritual Warfare</a> ):</p>
<p>In 1964, Brazil elected a communist president, Joao Goulart. Like all Communists, Goulart wanted to rid his country of religion, especially Catholicism.</p>
<p>When a prominent cardinal urged Brazilians to pray the rosary and renew Our Lady’s message at Fatima, Goulart mocked the rosary and those who prayed it. Goulart said in a broadcast message that his Communist “reforms” would save Brazil, “not the rosaries of simple women.”</p>
<p>But hell hath no fury like rosary-wielding women scorned.</p>
<p>Again, from Champions of the Rosary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Goulart’s] words greatly upset the Brazilian people, and they decided to confront the Communists during the rally in Belo Horizonte. The rally in Belo Horizonte was led by Goulart’s brother-in-law, Leone Brizola, and it was to be one of the largest Communist rallies in the country. As it was taking place, more than 20,000 women marched right into the midst of the Communist rally and prayed the Rosary so loudly that it shut the rally down. On March 19, only six days after the women broke up the Communist rally, more than 600,000 people marched through the streets of Sao Paolo praying the rosary in the famous “March of the Family with God toward Freedom.“  … <strong>Many non-Catholics did attend the march and prayed the rosary with the Catholics</strong> as they marched in defiance against the Communist vision of the president. Goulart was so intimidated by the rosary army that within two weeks he fled the country! In thanksgiving for the rosary victory, the people of Brazil organized another march in gratitude to Our Lady and her rosary. It was held on April 2, 1964, one day after President Goulart fled the country. This march was called the “March of Thanksgiving to God.” More than a million people marched through the streets of Rio de Janeiro celebrating their freedom from the threat of Communism.</p>

<h3 id="rosary-crusade-for-venezuela">Rosary Crusade for Venezuela</h3>
<p>Because some rogue Catholics helped get Venezuela into this mess, I&rsquo;d like to ask my Catholic brothers and sisters, along with all believers who read this blog, to pray with me for the deliverance of the Venezuelan people from the grips of evil Marxism.</p>
<h4 id="prayer-to-our-lady-of-fatima-against-communism">Prayer to Our Lady of Fatima against Communism</h4>
<p>O Queen of Fatima, in this hour of so many dangers for the Americas and the world, turn away from us the scourge of atheistic communism. Do not allow communist regimes, which deny all the Commandments of God, to be established in the many countries born and formed under the sacred influence of Christian civilization. Therefore, O Lady, nourish and intensify the rejection which communism encounters at all levels of society in the Americas, in particular for the people of Venezuela. Our Father&hellip;, Hail Mary&hellip;, Glory be, etc.</p>
