                The other one was 1975. At least in my lifetime.
1975 was weird for good reasons and bad. Saturday Night Live debuted with the Not Ready For Prime Time Players: Dan Akroyd, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtain, Gilda Radner, and Garrett Morris. President Gerald Ford tried to stop inflation with WIN buttons (seriously). New York City faced bankruptcy, but, after initially saying &amp;lsquo;drop dead,&amp;rsquo; Gerry Ford ended up bailing it out with $2.

                Have you ever wondered why moments end?
I wrote about the Irish Moment and the Jewish Moment and the Gay Moment on Saturday. Three Moments enjoyed by identifiable groups of Americans. Moments that ended when the groups joined the main plot of the American story, leaving the artistic sub-plot to the next in line.
Demographics offer only one kind of Moment, though. There are cultural moments and fashion moments and, of course, political moments.

                The only Christmas I remember getting everything I wanted was in 1975.
First, I was finally old enough (12) to not be so shallow and needy and get pissed off if I didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly what I wanted. Santa Claus and my parents and sisters were really good to me, but until 1975 I could still get worked up if the Erector Set I got wasn&amp;rsquo;t the 118-piece set with real electric motor.

                The vices are, indeed, let loose, and they wander and do damage. But the virtues are let loose also; and the virtues wander more wildly, and the virtues do more terrible damage. The modern world is full of the old Christian virtues gone mad. The virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone. Thus some scientists care for truth; and their truth is pitiless.

                Alton, Illinois — Spirits of the dead in the river city of Alton, Illinois, voted last night to organize as a union affiliated with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).
Everett Johnson, a lawyer representing the ghosts, says he will begin negotiations with the town’s haunted house tour guides, spirit shops, and even owners of haunted properties.
“The living have been exploiting these tortured souls for decades,” Johnson told Hennessy’s View.

                Dina Spector breathlessly reports that &amp;ldquo;December Heat Wave Smashes Temperature Records In New York City&amp;rdquo; on Business Insider. Her hysteria relies on a Huffington Post piece which relies on an AP story.
And they&amp;rsquo;re all wrong.
I checked with NOAA on record temperature maximums in the US on December 21, 2013. There were none.

I watched Duck Dynasty once or twice. I don&amp;rsquo;t get it.
That makes me different. Fourteen million people watch the show every week. That&amp;rsquo;s more than watch any other show on television. Clearly, I&amp;rsquo;m a little odd, especially among conservatives.
That&amp;rsquo;s okay. I&amp;rsquo;m used to being weird.
I never expected that a reality TV show would stop a &amp;ldquo;moment.&amp;rdquo; But that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what&amp;rsquo;s happened.

We were at Sunnen Lake near Potosi, Missouri. My dad worked at Sunnen Products, and the company provided Sunnen Lake as a free recreation spot for employees and retirees. (Pretty cool perk.)
The recreation complex was pretty rustic then. About ten cabins, a recreation hall with ping-pong and a huge fireplace. The big parking lot near the Rec Hall was covered with pea-size brown and tan gravel held in place by an eight-inch railroad tie wall.

                Before I answer that, a little science.
Scientists study all kinds of things. One thing they study is ants, because ants teach a lot about communities.
In a recent study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, ecologists Shigeto Dobata and Kazuki Tsuji studied the effects of &amp;ldquo;cheaters&amp;rdquo; in a colony of Pristomyrmex Punctatus ants.
P. Punctati segment their society into two groups by age. Younger ants tend to hang around the house reproducing asexually.

                I wanted to be William F. Buckley Jr. All I lacked was his intellect, education, and unique experiences.
Well, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be him. I wanted to be the next one.
Every day, I wrote a 750-word piece. Poorly. I believed that practice would improve my writing.
It didn&amp;rsquo;t.
One day, I realized, as long as I tried to be the next William F. Buckley, I was destined for frustration and failure.

                I can be pretty hard on Republicans. Not hard enough for some. Too hard for others.
But I, at least, try to time my battles for ideological consistency. As a general rule, odd-numbered years are for cleaning up the GOP. Even-numbered years are for cleaning out Democrats.
This is an odd-numbered year. Right up to the votes on the continuing resolution,my primary targets were Republicans, especially Roy Blunt.
Once the House exercised its Constitutional power of the purse strings, sending a popular continuing resolution to the Senate, the battle lines shifted.

RINO stands for &amp;ldquo;Republican In Name Only.&amp;rdquo; Rhinos and Elephants are both pachyderms, so it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty clever name for people who join the Republican Party but prefer the Democrat platform.

WWII Veterans asked the White House for permission to visit the World War II Memorial in case of a shutdown. The veterans are part of the Honor Flights program that helps aging veterans visit the WWII Memorial.
Even though there&amp;rsquo;s no cost involved, the White House chose to dishonor the veterans&amp;rsquo; request. It send forth &amp;ldquo;goons,&amp;rdquo; in Senator Paul&amp;rsquo;s works, to erect barricades around the memorial.

                I was wrong.
As the continuing resolution fight approached, I expected House Republicans to cave. I expected Boehner to make a half-hearted attempt to use debt ceiling, instead of continuing resolution, as leverage to stop Obamacare. And I expected Republican Senators to make a stand.
But that&amp;rsquo;s not what happened.
In reverse order, Senate Republican leadership ran away from confrontation like schoolgirls spying a snake. Led by Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, and Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Junior Senator Roy Blunt, the GOP attacked Senators Mike Lee and Ted Cruz instead of Obamacare.

McConnell will, of course, vote nay on the final bill. But that&amp;rsquo;s just a gimmick.
McConnell&amp;rsquo;s slick maneuver is short-sighted. It will bite him.  Slick Mitch knows as well as anyone that Obamacare is a disaster for the American people.

From Heritage Action for America:
   This morning, House leaders announced they would pass a continuing resolution that funds the government but defunds Obamacare this week.
 In many ways, today’s announcement represents “a victory…for the GOP’s conservative wing and its tea-party allies.” (Wall Street Journal) However, it also represents a victory for the tens of thousands of workers who have seen their hours cut thanks to Obamacare and to the patients searching for new doctors.

                There&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as a perfect candidate.
So quit waiting for one, and quit staying at home and casting a protest vote.
We need your help. Who are we you ask? The voters who have been getting their asses handed to them. We have about a hundred years of making up to do and we need to get started with a strategy.
If we can elect a candidate that we agree with:

                _Historic Veto Session leaves Missourians frustrated. _
Why is it that we expect more from elected public servants than from ourselves? We demand and expect them to stand up, sometimes alone, in a chamber full of their peers and fight for us, yet we don&amp;rsquo;t do it in our own communities!
When we get frustrated with our elected representatives in Jefferson City (and Washington) who don&amp;rsquo;t stand up for us, our knee-jerk response is to try to elect someone else in their place and hope that new representative will listen to us.

“I have asked Congress to find something else to do for a couple of weeks,” seemed to be the theme. Or “there’s something wrong with you people for wanting to bomb a Middle East country. I mean, they’re Muslims for God’s sake.

                Eric Cantor’s latest tactic in the battle to defund Obamacare reminds me of the Trojan Rabbit in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
According to Business Insider’s Josh Barro:
 It&amp;rsquo;s a strategy predicated on the idea that Republican activists are stupid. Many of them are stupid. But they&amp;rsquo;re not stupid enough to fall for this.
 (Barro is hard-left, btw.)
From what I can gather, Cantor intends to pass two continuing resolutions out of the House.

                The White House admits it has no hard evidence that the Syrian government launched the alleged chemical weapons attack.
Instead, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough told the Associated Press “a common sense test” implicates the Syrian government.
Well, no, it doesn’t. Quite the opposite, in fact.
Chemical weapons attacks are signs of desperation. But Assad’s forces have recently gained the upper hand against rebels according to numerous sources.

                I got four emails from Republican candidates today. They all sucked.
I’ve made every mistake they made, so I won’t beat anyone up over it.
But if conservative candidates want to win elections, they have to become—or hire—excellent marketers.
Everybody freaks out about the Democrat advantage in data, analytics, and social. But 80 percent of that gap is good execution of scientifically established marketing principles.
Republicans tend to despise marketing. They reject psychology.

  I am far from convinced that the chemical attack was perpetrated by the government. Terrorism expert Yosef Brodansky reported that the preponderance of evidence indicates Syrian rebels released the sarin attack.

Boehner doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to. He&amp;rsquo;s afraid that shutting down the government will hurt Republicans in the 2014 election.

 My hometown of St. Louis, Missouri was the largest city west of the Mississippi River in 1850, and the second largest port city in the entire country. Only New York handled more tonnage than the riverboats that docked, often more than a hundred at a time, at the St. Louis levee. Among other things, the riverboats supplied equipment, people, horses, and other materials to a burgeoning population of pioneers who rode wagon trains out from St.

Rather, I’m a libertarian-ish conservative. I like a small central government that protects us from evil people in other countries and delivers mail. And prosecutes people who do great harm across state lines.

In fact, I was a theatre major for a couple of years. I think the right’s neglect of the arts is one of our biggest failings. The arts reach people at an emotional level. Intellectual arguments cannot change emotional attachments.
So here’s a chance to rev up your American patriotic spirits while connecting with the arts.

                The police in Watertown responded magnificently. But the most brilliant strategic move gets little notice from the press.

For about sixteen hours, hundreds of law officers, FBI agents, helicopters, and satellites scoured a relatively tiny area of Boston suburbs for one wounded terrorist. At the same time, they kept the public relatively safe, off the streets, and out of the way of their manhunt.
**But they didn’t find their man.

I just walked past a carbon-copy of my little doggy Stella guarding her homeless master who was sleeping on the stoop of a building at 8th and Mission. They were the first two people on the street who weren&amp;rsquo;t smoking dope.

Then it dawned on me. In San Francisco, there is no opportunity for people at the bottom to climb up to the top.

 Let’s stick with that one. To be terrorism, all of these five elements must be present. You can use it as a checklist:

                This post is a bit unusual for me.
Strange and disturbing thoughts crowded my mind tonight—Sunday, March 7.
These thoughts interrupted my television viewing. I couldn’t really focus. Then, I couldn’t sleep. The thoughts won’t rest, and they won’t give me rest. So I write.
I’m bewildered by the world’s stock markets. Someone told the Wall Street Journal that, sure, the US economy seems to be tanking, manufacturing’s falling, the labor rate’s in the toilet.

The Loudons took a big gamble. It’s about time someone did.
Gina is dead on. As I’ve been saying for awhile, we have to break out of our affinity bubbles. That means going to places we might not be accepted.

                The RNC’s Autopsy report wants to do away with caucuses and conventions, replacing them with regional primaries. But I’ll propose a different reform that will make candidate selection more interesting, whether in a caucus or a primary.
A Word About The Autopsy The idea of compacting the primary season and eliminating caucuses has some merit, but also a lot of downside. On the plus side are splashier events to showcase the party, fewer Tuesdays littered with politics, and, believe it or not, some economies as candidates can focus on one geographical region at a time.

What’s wrong with this headline?

I’ll tell you what’s wrong with it. It shouts: “Everybody’s getting an abortion!” Even if connected with messages that say abortion is wrong.
In numerous studies, messages intended to discourage a behavior by promoting the number of people engaged in the behavior (called negative social proof) actually caused the behavior to increase.

                The GOP’s self-examination on the 2012 election debacle rightly identifies marketing and messaging and lack of a ground game as contributors to that mess.

But the GOP’s self-exam missed a potentially fatal problem for the party: the American people simply do not trust Republicans on the budget.

Those were the words of Missouri State Senator Kurt Schaefer to Director of Revenue Brian K. Long in a heated hearing at the Missouri State Capitol this morning.

Senator Schaefer and researchers at the Missouri Family Network, who broke this story, learned prior to the hearing that Long’s department has ordered Missouri fee office workers to violate state law by collecting and storing personal identifying information (PII) on everyone who renews a driver’s license, non-driver ID, or concealed carry permit in Missouri.

                A lot. Marijuana prohibition costs enough to put more than 900 new police officers on the streets.
Here’s the numbers from Harvard and Cato scholar Jeffrey A. Miron and marijuana law reform researcher Abhi Sivasailam (via Show-Me Cannabis):
 Missouri would save about $90 million in government expenditure and yield roughly $59 million in tax revenue annually. This assumes that marijuana would be taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco and that all other states and the federal government would also legalize.

                Jennifer Rubin—WaPo’s token conservative—said it perfectly:
 McCain lost his cool with Rand Paul and sounded like the old man down the street screaming to the new kids on the block, “Get off my lawn!”
 The real reason McCain and Lindsey Graham embarrassed themselves on the floor of Senate had nothing to do with what Rand Paul said. Rand Paul&amp;rsquo;s ideas terrify McCain, Graham, and most of the Republican establishment.

You slowly look around the desert and white shards of light catch your eye. Reflections of the sun off lenses of cameras mounted on poles about every every 30 degrees around the perimeter of the field.

2009: 59% Conservative

With almost 60% calling themselves somewhat or very conservative, how could Barack Obama get re-elected? How could Republicans fail to gain the Senate in 2010 and 2012? Come to think of it, how do Democrats win at all?
The answer is simple: being conservative doesn’t make you Republican, but being Democrat makes you a liberal.

                One of the most powerful tools of influence is fear.
Decades of research shows that fear of loss is about three times as motivating as hope for gain. (This changes under certain situations, like conditions of certain loss, but that’s for another time.)
So political message writers often use negative messages to influence voters to take a chance on a cause or a candidate.
This tactic works well with Republican voters, and less well with Democrats.

First, Rubio’s Cuban, and the GOP wants to court Latinos.
Second, Rubio’s relatively young, and the GOP wants to stop the bleeding when it comes to young voters.
But there’s a fundamental problem with the Republican approach, and it stems from the GOP’s least favorite discipline: behavioral science.

Republicans should announce “the sequester won’t be so bad” and shut up, and science tells us why.
Obama, the Dems, liberal pundits, the press, and even John Boehner are running around yelling about how horrible the sequester will be.
In some deep recesses of our minds, we agree. “Oh, my God! We’re all going to do die!”
Fear-mongering only works in the future because, in short, nothing is as bad (or as good) as we think it will be when we think about it.

Libertarian reforms offer the best hope, because all the other conservative factions – evangelicals, Second Amendment, home schoolers, fiscal &amp;ndash; have hit their high-water marks. We saw that in 2012. Liberty, however, sells with the kids. Or it might, if Republicans would try it.

In his roles at Freeman and the Missouri Chamber, Beshore advocates for Obamacare Medicaid Expansion in Missouri.

                I know a teacher pretty well, and I know nasty little secrets she’s not telling.
She sneaks out of bed at 4:45 every morning. No one else is up. No one’s watching her. At that hour, she can do whatever she wants without consequence.
She sneaks downstairs and puts on her make-up in front of the TV. She also encrypts mysterious lesson plans into a little black book. Names and numbers.

                Why would the Missouri Chamber of Commerce want to expand Obamacare in Missouri? Short-sighted pursuit of money.

The Missouri Chambermaids of Cronyism Here’s the simple truth: the Missouri Chamber of Commerce is not conservative. It does not exist to advance limited government and fiscal responsibility and free enterprise capitalism. The Missouri Chamber of Commerce has become convinced that it must lie down before government and beg for scraps from the federal table.

                Often, the best outcome seems less satisfying than alternatives.

Daniel Kahneman is a psychologist who won a Nobel in economics for Prospect Theory, more commonly called Behavioral Economics. In his book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman describes a cognitive bias that leads people to make the wrong choice on automobiles. But the bias might actually keep gasoline consumption high by fooling people with number.
Say you’re concerned with the amount of gasoline you use.

                In a blow to the old guard establishment,** the Missouri Republican State Committee elected Ed Martin Jr. as its new party chairman**.

Roy Blunt and all six Republican members of Congress from Missouri lobbied the new state committee over the past few weeks to block Ed and retain the establishment’s choice, David Cole. Jo Mannies of the St. Louis Beacon wrote:
 Cole’s loss appears to be a setback for Missouri’s GOP establishment.

                William F. Buckley proposed a simple tax reform in 1973. The language barrier that separates people like Buckley from that odd species we call Congress prevented his thoughts from finding fertile soil. And in the 40 years between, the tax code has become only murkier and more dangerous.

“Our tax laws were,” Buckley wrote in _Four Reforms: A Guide for the Seventies, “_designed historically to raise revenue for the operations of government.

The Senate’s been a lost cause for a while, so let’s not even bother with the upper house. Besides, it’s really hard to focus on good fiscal policy while Hooter’s Girls are passing out Bacardi 151 shots, Buffalo wings, and “Welcome 2013” horns in the cloak room.
Over in the House, things looked interesting for a while.

                When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for conservatives to divorce themselves from superstitions they’ve embraced since the Progressive Movement of the 1920s and join the pantheon of reasonable people, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
I hold these truths to be totally friggin’ obvious, that all drugs are not created equal, that we’ve wasted billions of dollars and millions of lives pursuing a** demented “zero tolerance” temperance goal that was Never Going To Happen**, that the losses we’ve endured trying stamp out weed have cost American society more than they&amp;rsquo;ve gained, that among these losses are lives, money, and opportunity.
