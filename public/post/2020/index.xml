      <description>Five hundred West Point Military Academy graduates became the ideological heirs of Robert E. Lee this week. I bet they didn&amp;rsquo;t even realize it. The Gateway Pundit reports that 500 former West Point grads denounce &amp;ldquo;politicization&amp;rdquo; of the military and refuse to defend America against domestic enemies.
Oath of Commissioned Officers  I [state your name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter.</description>

      <title>A Crazy Democrat Idea That Doesn&#39;t Go Far Enough</title>

      <description>House Democrats last week introduced a federal police reform bill. As usual, the bill is terrible, even in concept. Policing is a local issue.
But, like a broken clock, the Democrat bill is right on one matter: their bill makes qualified immunity a legislative issue instead of a judicial concern.
What Is &amp;lsquo;Qualified Immunity&amp;rsquo; Qualified immunity bars lawsuits against public officials whose actions cause actual damages unless those actions violate the law.</description>

      <title>Moderna&#39;s COVID Vaccine Announcement Was Likely a Stock Manipulation Scheme</title>

      <description>Just days after I reported that an effective COVID-19 vaccine is highly unlikely, the pharmaceutical company Moderna issued a press release touting promising results from early human trials. People assumed I was wrong.
But I&amp;rsquo;m doubling down. Moderna&amp;rsquo;s vaccine trials have probably already failed, and Moderna&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;encouraging&amp;rdquo; press release proves it.
Coronavirus Vaccines Are Unlikely From The Humane Approach to Coronavirus Is to Open Up Everything published May 16:
 There Probably Won&amp;rsquo;t Be a Coronavirus Vaccine: Since early March, researchers around the world have been warning us that a vaccine for Coronavirus is highly unlikely for a straightforward reason: they have been searching for vaccines against Coronaviruses for decades and have never produced one.</description>

      <title>Congress shall make no law abridging the ignorance of the Press</title>

      <description>The usual suspects on the CNN and MSNBC claim no president has ever called on the National Guard or the Army to put down riots and revolts.
&amp;ldquo;Unprecedented,&amp;rdquo; said Larry O&amp;rsquo;Donnell on MNSBC.
&amp;ldquo;Dictatorship,&amp;rdquo; declared CNN&amp;rsquo;s Don Lemon.
Once upon a time, people in journalism had good historical educations. Reporters of the past didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily study history in college. Most learned history by researching current stories. This is how most people learn most of what they know.</description>

      <title>The Stunning Contrast Between Treatment of Hairdressers vs. Hooligans</title>
      <link>https://hennessysview.com/hairdressers-vs-hooligans/</link>

      <description>A stunning contrast. Our leaders show more patience and respect (or is it fear?) for hooligans, thugs, and terrorists than for small business owners who pay the leaders&amp;rsquo; salaries and fill their campaign coffers.
Political favoritism shown to violent street gangs will end, or the leaders will face a revolt from the right like nobody&amp;rsquo;s every seen before.
When people feel their backs are to the wall, they fight for their lives.</description>
