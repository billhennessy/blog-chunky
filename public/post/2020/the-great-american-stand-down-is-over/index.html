<blockquote>
<p>“What we did was we closed everything down. That was our public health strategy. Just close everything, all businesses, old workers, young people, old people, short people, tall people. Every school closed, everything.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you rethought that or had time to analyze that public health strategy, I don&rsquo;t know that you would say quarantine everyone. I don&rsquo;t even know that that was the best public health policy. Young people then quarantined with older people was probably not the best public health strategy because the younger people could have been exposing the older people to an infection.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have to do both. We’re working on it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, wait. I&rsquo;m sorry. Did I tell you President Trump said that today? I was wrong. President Trump said something like that <em>yesterday</em>. And the day before.</p>
<p>No, those quotes didn&rsquo;t come from the president. They came from Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York.</p>
<p>Now, when Trump said words to that effect, the fake news media, leftist doctors, and moron pundits went berserk. At press conferences, hyperventilating New York Times reports <em>screamed</em> at the president, &ldquo;people are going to DIE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What do those leftist idiots do now? Now that the Great White Hope of the Democrat Party has endorsed President Trump&rsquo;s get-back-to-work strategy?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing the New York Times and the Washington Post will print front page apologies to the president for reflexively denigrating another brilliant idea from Mr. Trump, right? I mean, isn&rsquo;t that the only decent thing for them to do?</p>
<p>Dr. Fauci, whatever his merits, isn&rsquo;t president. He&rsquo;s not responsible for the American economy or the US military, or trade negotiations. Fauci&rsquo;s view of the world is as narrow as plastic straw. He&rsquo;s a doctor.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t elect Dr. Fauci president. We elected Donald Trump. President Trump has lent remarkable deference to the epidemiologist and virologists in and around government. He did exactly what they asked: a 15-day national stand-down.</p>
<p>Well, those 15 days end next Tuesday. It&rsquo;s time for President Trump to wrestle control of the country from medical specialists and, weighing their sound advice, get America moving again.</p>
<p>And, if you think I&rsquo;m just another Trump fanboy endorsing whatever falls out of Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, go back to the top of this post and read what Saint Andrew Cuomo says. (It&rsquo;s the same thing.)</p>

                Hysterical headlines scream about the number of new coronavirus infections every hour. This is a mistake. Ignore those headlines. Number of confirmed cases will rise as number of people tested rises. If we tested everyone for the flu, the number of confirmed flu cases would be astronomical.
Doing some casual analysis, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious what drives the death rate: the number of hospitalizations in a given geographic area.
Last week I pointed out that mean averages are meaningless, even destructive if used to project into the future.

Moments ago, I caught myself engrossed in a long news story about the goings on in the United States Senate over the two-trillion dollar coronavirus stimulus.

                Democrats are bent on plunging America into an economic depression. Democrats love misery.
While I&amp;rsquo;ve been in favor of &amp;ldquo;overreacting&amp;rdquo; to the coronavirus pandemic, we will have no choice but to simply return to status quo ante without immediate economic relief.
I urge President Trump to give 24 hours to pass the Republican Senate emergency relief bill. If it hasn&amp;rsquo;t passed, end the national emergency, rescind all disaster declarations declared on behalf of states, and order the DOJ and the National Guard to guarantee freedom of speech, movement, religion, and commerce in every state.
