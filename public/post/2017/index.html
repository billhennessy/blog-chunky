Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve answered, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the limits of data science in 2018.
The best data scientists in the world agreed with nearly absolute certainty. These scientists determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hillary Clinton would be the 45th President of the United States. That was in 2016.
Those scientists were wrong.

                Scott Adams first identified Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s greatest strength. What do you think that might be?
It&amp;rsquo;s not his money or his business experience. Those are strengths, sure, but they&amp;rsquo;re not THE strength.
Scott Adams believes Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign was a movie script. Here&amp;rsquo;s what Adams wrote way, way back when Trump&amp;rsquo;s candidacy was still just a PR stunt because he had zero chance of winning even a single primary:
 A movie script is almost always arranged in what the professionals call a three-act form.

                If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering how things will change in 2018, you might think back the mid-1980s.
In the 1980s, leftist professors, leftist news media, and leftist entertainers were angry. For years, they&amp;rsquo;d preached that Ronald Reagan was a neo-Nazi buffoon whose incompetence and malice would destroy America. Maybe even wipe out the human species. &amp;ldquo;I believe Ronald Reagan can turn America back into what it once was,&amp;rdquo; said comedian Steve Martin on Saturday Night Live in 1980, &amp;ldquo;a vast wasteland covered with ice.

Now, let&amp;rsquo;s look back at the New York City de Blasio inherited. According to ZeroHedge blog:

                Forgive me. I say &amp;ldquo;liberal&amp;rdquo; sometimes when I mean something else.
My mistake is habit, not irony. (Irony would require some intent on my part.)
I grew up disparaging liberalism. I grew up reading and watching William F. Buckley Jr., for whom liberalism was the enemy.
In the post-WWII era, the liberalism of the day was a problem. But it was never the problem.
The problem in Western Civilization was a faction that used liberalism as cover.

The reason: President Trump&amp;rsquo;s pressure on owners to crack down on anthem haters will stir up a fight between NFL Players Association and the owners.
As if on cue:

President Trump seems pathologically opposed to festering problems. When he sees a festering problem, he pops it like a zit. For example, the North Korean nukes problem has festered since the Clinton administration. Trump is bringing Little Rocket Man to a head.
NAFTA has been festering since the Clinton administration. Trump is bringing NAFTA to a head.

Everyone sees the symptoms of football&amp;rsquo;s death spiral: empty stadiums. Crashed ratings. low quality. Criminals on the field. Some people call it &amp;ldquo;the National Felony League.&amp;rdquo;
Frustrated fans look for better entertainment. Ticket sales remain high for one reason: stupid corporate executives. Stupid executives think it&amp;rsquo;s still a status symbol to control lots of NFL tickets.

I felt like the lone voice on the right last week when I wrote &amp;ldquo;Counseling Sessions.&amp;rdquo; It feels great to have Greg Jarrett agree: Jeff Sessions should resign.
As Jarrett puts it:
 Sessions appears either incapable or incompetent. He has resisted producing the documents relevant to the anti-Trump dossier which were subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee. He has failed to appoint a special counsel to reopen the case against Hillary Clinton for likely violations of the Espionage Act in the use of her email server, obstruction of justice for destroying 33,000 emails under congressional subpoena, and potential self-dealing for profit through her foundation.

CNN previously mocked and scorned President Trump for suggesting Obama wiretapped Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign. CNN says Mueller&amp;rsquo;s office cautioned that conclusions about Russian connection were &amp;ldquo;inconclusive.

Arthur C. Brooks wrote in The Conservative Heart:
 There is a common misconception that conservatives are materialistic. We are not, and this confusion is a central political irony of our time. Progressives truly want to help the poor but have tried to solve poverty primarily with government money, relegating talk of culture to the past and focusing more and more on income inequality.

                It was probably a coincidence.
One day after Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View reported Speaker Paul &amp;ldquo;Dumbbell&amp;rdquo; Ryan as a member of the Antifa caliphate support team, Speaker Ryan&amp;rsquo;s office renounced his membership in the terrorist group&amp;rsquo;s fan club.

As reported by The Gateway Pundit:
 Social media was set ablaze after Paul Ryan attacked President Trump for condemning ‘both sides’ for the violence in Charlottesville. Trump supporters hammered Paul Ryan for refusing to condemn Antifa.

                Yesterday, I explained the military strategy behind Antifa&amp;rsquo;s remarkable growth.
In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it, Antifa has effectively shut down grass roots conservative speech. You cannot hold a public rally, march, or carnival if your views conflict with Antifa&amp;rsquo;s.
Antifa has established a small caliphate in North America. Just like ISIS did in Syria and Iraq.
And the government&amp;rsquo;s doing absolutely nothing about it. You should read my military strategy post and all the links.

                You know this blog rarely criticizes President Trump. There&amp;rsquo;s a simple reason for that. That reason is the thousands of fraudulent journalists who create and repeat lies about President Trump every day. Like Jake &amp;ldquo;The Fake&amp;rdquo; Tapper. Those fake journalists don&amp;rsquo;t need my help.
You also know that I have criticized President Bush, Republican candidates for president, and many, many other Republicans and conservatives. I just adopted a simple rule last year: until the fake news media treats President Trump honestly and fairly, I won&amp;rsquo;t criticize my president.

President Trump tonight reminded so many of us why we elected him. Because he&amp;rsquo;s a street fighter. Because he&amp;rsquo;s a patriot. Because there are bad people who wish us harm, and Donald Trump is okay with killing them.

                CNN screwed up. And it reminds me of an incident from 1970.
A headline writer admitted that the Antifa terror group seeks &amp;ldquo;peace through violence.&amp;rdquo; Later, presumably after receiving threats from Antifa terrorists, CNN removed the &amp;ldquo;peace through violence&amp;rdquo; sub-head.
But the damage was done. CNN stumbled onto real news. Real news that exposes Antifa&amp;rsquo;s terrorist aims.
Before we get to the dangers of normalizing political violence, aka &amp;ldquo;terrorism,&amp;rdquo; let&amp;rsquo;s remember a famous party.

My friends are fired up. Because of Governor Greitens&amp;rsquo;s executive order. **An executive order that implements a novel approach to prescription drug databases. **
In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, Governor Greitens signed an executive order on July 17. The EO made Missouri the 50th state to establish some sort of prescription drug tracking.
Most states track everything about prescriptions.

Reince Priebus, the erstwhile White House chief of staff who prides himself on blocking deplorables from the White House posts they deserve, has been relieved of duties.

                If the election were held today, Senator Kid Rock would be a thing.
Via The Gateway Pundit:
News broke this weekend that Kid Rock is LEADING challenger, Dem Debbie Stabenow in a new poll 30% to 26%! Everyone who wrote this off as a joke, then as a publicity stunt, then as impossible, then as improbable will be forced to say &amp;ldquo;Senator Rock&amp;rdquo; soon. Very soon.

 Freedom begins with understanding what we control and we do not. Yet very few people even begin to consider this essential dichotomy.
Even in the complete absence of &amp;ldquo;administration&amp;rdquo; as Tocqueville observed in early 19th century America, no one was free who failed to understand Epictetus&amp;rsquo;s control dichotomy: some things are under our control, some are not.

Why are you complaining about Governor Greitens&amp;rsquo; first term? Did you not read his books?
Like Donald Trump, Eric Greitens called his plays at the line of scrimmage.

                Sounds ridiculous, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?
How could a reporter at New York Times blackmail an FBI or CIA agent?
Easily. And everyone who ever went through counter-espionage training knows it.
What Went Down This morning, British Prime Minister Theresa May chastised the US government. The UK freely shares anti-terrorism intelligence with the US. The US is expected to keep secrets secret.
But the US intel community is one gigantic sieve these days.

Seth Rich was murdered. Two gunshots to his back. Like you&amp;rsquo;d see on The Sopranos (video). The police called it a robbery. But nothing was stolen. Not his cell phone. Not his wallet. Not his watch. Not his cash.
Shortly after his murder, Wikileaks posted embarrassing emails. Emails from the Democratic National Committee&amp;rsquo;s email server. Wikileaks maintains that the theft of the emails was an inside job.

For those of you who do not follow things as mundane as television rating scores, you may be surprised to learn that Fox News Channel (FNC) is losing its lead as the powerhouse in primetime cable TV ratings to MSNBC. There are a couple of reasons why.
First, control of FNC has been transferred to two brothers, Lachlan and James Murdoch, who do not believe in the political message espoused by Fox for the last twenty years.

                Do you follow the recommended diets? Low fat. High carbohydrate? Eat lots of fruit?
If so, you&amp;rsquo;re probably overweight. And your blood tests are probably a mess. Maybe your doctor recommends expensive prescriptions to lower your cholesterol.
A new study finds the problem is not your fault. Your doctor, poorly educated in nutrition, and government recommendations, prompted by industry lobbyists, are designed to keep you fat and sick. And it&amp;rsquo;s not just US government.

                Congress is about to pass a budget. I call it a &amp;ldquo;Paul Ryan Special.&amp;rdquo; This budget lets the government spend money for four months. It expires in September.
The budget is horrible. Republicans are spinning a few &amp;ldquo;wins&amp;rdquo; in the budget, but that&amp;rsquo;s a terrible argument. It&amp;rsquo;s like telling a terminal cancer patient, &amp;ldquo;but your blood pressure&amp;rsquo;s pretty good.&amp;rdquo;

Some folks disagreed with my instant assessment of the Syrian strike. My assessment: Trump&amp;rsquo;s surprise military attack will shift four narratives in Trump&amp;rsquo;s favor:
** Trump is Hitler: dead ** Trump is a Russian agent: dead ** Trump is incompetent: dying ** Trump is a lightweight among world leaders: dead
In other words, it took 59 cruise missiles to blow up the left&amp;rsquo;s anti-Trump narratives.

Instead of going to tax reform next, President Trump should work on that big-league infrastructure bill. Now. Fast.
President Trump needs a big win because power is in perception. He also needs to put Democrats in a bind. Plus, he needs to prove he can pass big legislation without all GOP factions on board.
The solution is infrastructure.
During the campaign, Trump spoke of a massive building project to rejuvenate our roads, modernize our airports, and more.

If your biggest problem involves choosing between multiple appealing jobs, everything else will seem less important. Because picking the right job is a really big deal.
For the past decade, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably worried about finding or keeping any job.

                Overexposure to antibiotics and antibacterial soaps and lotions makes bacteria stronger. They adapt.
That same thing happened to Obamacare over the years. It&amp;rsquo;s now untouchable.
** Obamacare survived the election of Scott Brown in Massachusetts. So it was born in a toxic environment. ** Then, Obamacare survived two Supreme Court rulings, each time by a single vote from the chief justice. ** Finally, Obamacare survived seven years of Republican promises to repeal it immediately upon winning the White House and Congress.

                Yesterday, I placed blame for the healthcare debacle at Speaker Ryan&amp;rsquo;s feet. I also wrote that I expected the Republican establishment to blame the tea party. To blame us for aborting the Trump presidency in his first 100 days.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to beat the establishment to that punch a little. Because the Freedom Caucus and some of my favorite action organizations looked a little juvenile in this debate. Juvenile and stupid.

                General George S. Patton arrived in North Africa with a single mission: lead the Allied forces to victory over the Hun.
But Patton&amp;rsquo;s assignment was also in response to a miserable and deadly failure of leadership. The failed leadership of General Lloyd Fredendall.
 Fredendall was a Francophobe and an Anglophobe ill-suited to wage coalition warfare; a micromanager who bypassed the chain of command – giving orders as far down as company level; a coward, he allowed animus with subordinates to affect his judgment and undercut their authority; and finally, staring defeat in the face at Kasserine, he tried to pin the blame on others.

 It is absolutely imperative that you as a negotiator understand the importance of this point. You do NOT need this deal, because** to be needy is to lose control and make bad decisions**.

                Today, President Trump changed the game. He changed the Prisoner&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma (coordination) into a game of Chicken (competition).
Lifer Republicans have no experience with games of chicken. They were raised on coordination games.
By changing the game to Chicken, Donald Trump greatly increased the chances that phony Paul Ryan&amp;rsquo;s healthcare will PASS.
Here&amp;rsquo;s why briefly.
Psychologically, people always think they have more time. Republicans, in particular, believe time is limitless. Lifelong Republicans think they can delay any decision until the decision they want is a given.

                President Donald Trump delivered his budget and a message for Congress.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m lazy, I&amp;rsquo;ll quote Time magazine.
First, the President&amp;rsquo;s message to Congress:
 &amp;ldquo;I urge the members of Congress to remember that last November the American people&amp;rsquo;s message was loud and clear. The mandate for change, expressed by the American people, was not my mandate; it was our mandate.&amp;rdquo;
 Then, the analysis:
 The President&amp;rsquo;s meaning was unmistakable: the public wants deep cuts in both spending and taxes, and any legislator who tries to keep the ax from falling risks putting his own neck under an ax at the polls.

The jobs were the good kind of jobs Trump talks about: manufacturing, mining. Jobs with grit.

This Twitter critic thinks it&amp;rsquo;s okay for the New York Times to lie (&amp;ldquo;Wiretapped Data Used In Inquiry of Trump Aides&amp;rdquo;), as long as they only lie in their headlines.

                Cold War submarine lore. I can&amp;rsquo;t go into all of it here, but I can tell you about one bit of that lore: the Crazy Ivan.
Modern submarines have incredible passive sonar arrays. They can hear everything in the ocean for hundreds of miles around. Everything.
Everything except something directly behind them. Behind a submarine is a big propeller or &amp;ldquo;screw.&amp;rdquo; It turns. It pushes water abaft. The noise and the motion combine to prevent sound waves from reaching the sensors.

In 2012, Barack Obama got caught telling Russian Prime Minister Medvedev that he&amp;rsquo;d have more &amp;ldquo;flexibility&amp;rdquo; after the election.
Later in 2012, during a debate, Obama accused GOP candidate Mitt Romney of stoking Cold War fears against our new friends in Moscow. Obama said, “The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because…the Cold War’s been over for 20 years!” In fact, in 2012, the whole pantheon of pantsuit partiersmocked warnings about Russia.

                The Concorde was a supersonic passenger plane. It shuttled people between New York and Paris very quickly.
When commercial Concorde flights began in 1976, the novelty and excitement of flying at twice the speed of sound led people to line up to take the flights. But after 27 years and several safety mishaps, the Concorde&amp;rsquo;s popularity waned. Flights were often less than half full, so British Airways, the operator, was losing money.

                Hate John McCain if you want. Call McCain a traitor, even.
I look at John McCain and marvel at his strength. Many do.
Everyone knows about McCain being shot down over Vietnam and spending 5 years in a POW camp. But most people don&amp;rsquo;t know about the deep emotional scar McCain brought home with him. And that emotional scar undoubtedly drives him to his fits of anger and telling lies about people he doesn&amp;rsquo;t like.

                What bothers you most when you&amp;rsquo;re in a bad mood?
You can imagine what it&amp;rsquo;s like be in a bad mood, can&amp;rsquo;t you? People go through periods of deep funk when nothing seems bright or cheerful, don&amp;rsquo;t they?
And when you&amp;rsquo;re in those moods, what&amp;rsquo;s the worst thing? That&amp;rsquo;s right, it&amp;rsquo;s being around a bunch of happy people having fun.
And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly how the left feels when they see Trump at a press conference: miserable amid the fun.

The President looked poised, cheerful, and humorous. He volleyed with Jim Acosta of CNN. He rated each question &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bad.&amp;rdquo; He explained why he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want a nuclear war with Russia because the press seems to think nuclear war is a good thing. He mocked those in the press who want him to bomb that Russian intel ship off Virginia.

Author Steven Pressfield wrote a book about defeating The Resistance. It&amp;rsquo;s called The War of Art, and it&amp;rsquo;s an awesome, wonderful book.
Overcoming and defeating The Resistance, Pressfield tells us, is the key to living the good life. I agree, even if I don&amp;rsquo;t agree on some of his enemies.

Imagine yourself surrounded on all sides by angry faces dressed in shabby clothes, some faces covered with bandanas or ski masks. People are chanting something you can&amp;rsquo;t quite understand, like a private joke you&amp;rsquo;re not allowed to get. Or maybe they&amp;rsquo;re chanting at you.

Seventy-five percent of murder victims in Chicago are black.

                It&amp;rsquo;s great to be right.
Yesterday I told you that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer played the White House press corps by telling the truth. But the press corps and many Americans have a psychosis that literally replaces some words with other words. It&amp;rsquo;s not dyslexia. It&amp;rsquo;s far worse because it&amp;rsquo;s selective.
In this case, Spicer said &amp;ldquo;witness&amp;rdquo; but journalists everywhere repeated, &amp;ldquo;attend.&amp;rdquo; I wrote about it here.
Well, today, Spicer explained the situation to a psychotic journalist almost the same way I did.

Reporters have this psychosis. Journalists. They have very bad ADHD it seems. They can&amp;rsquo;t pay attention. Like kids with ADHD. Chuck Todd and everybody at Business Insider should probably take Ritalin or something.
Reporters are also narcissists. No one goes into journalism unless they have a pathologically inflated ego. No one.
So I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk you through the proof, slowly, so even our narcissistic, hyperactive, attention-deficit-disordered journalists can understand that Sean Spicer played with them like a cat pawing a dying moth.

In high school (and after) we mocked the kids who took shop. The &amp;ldquo;greasers&amp;rdquo; who got credit for wrenching on cars or welding or making cabinets. It was the 1980s and shop, along with home economics, became an elective in most schools.
Until the 80s, some practical life skill class was a requirement at most American public and parochial high schools.

                You thought Stan Kroenke wanted a team in Los Angeles? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. I think Stan is playing a long con. And I think it&amp;rsquo;s a brilliant strategy.
Los Angeles is a terrible market for football teams, but it&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic market for the NFL. It would be a perfect place to build a permanent home for the Super Bowl. Los Angeles has fantastic weather, great attractions, and a huge pool of football fans, fans of every team in the NFL.

                This is about Big Data.
You really can&amp;rsquo;t over-estimate what suckers business people are.
I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about people who create things or improve things. Guys like Steve Jobs and Donald Trump built great businesses. But they weren&amp;rsquo;t business people. They were builders. Running a business was a necessary evil that allowed them the freedom to build what they wanted to build. They were great businessmen because they cared about the work their companies did.

                How will history remember the Tea Party movement of 2009 to 2016? The answer to that question depends on what we do next.
The Tea Party movement was an antagonistic movement. We opposed bad stuff. We sought punishment for bad actors. We saw that the experts were wrong, and we pointed out their folly. Like William F. Buckley&amp;rsquo;s charter for National Review, we stood athwart history, yelling &amp;ldquo;STOP!&amp;rdquo; At its heart, the Tea Party movement opposed a corrupt and insulated establishment class.
