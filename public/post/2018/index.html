                Millennials seem to believe anything that comes from the mouth of an &amp;ldquo;expert.&amp;rdquo; Even the older Millennials are probably too green to realize that listening to experts will produce worse results than going with your gut.
It works like this . . . when we go with our gut (or some non-expert&amp;rsquo;s suggestion), we build in a wide margin for error. We recognize the fallibility of our own judgment and proceed with due caution.

                Fasting is probably the healthiest thing you can do for yourself. It&amp;rsquo;s also the cheapest healthy thing you can do. Unlike most diets and exercise plans, supplements, and, especially, trips to a doctor, fasting actually saves money. When you fast, you don&amp;rsquo;t eat.
Further, fasting is the simplest thing you can do to improve your physical and mental health. There are only two things to remember:
 Don&amp;rsquo;t eat. Drink some water.

I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when I heard it the second time, phrased slightly differenlty: &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t be alive when . . . .&amp;rdquo;

I spent all day moving my blog from a self-hosted Wordpress site to a Hugo static site. Since I no longer support advertising, I don&amp;rsquo;t need all the weight of Wordpress. Plus, managing a blog through Github is actually easier for me. I use git professionally. And I pretty much think in Markdown at this point.
The final reason for the move is the change in direction for this blog.

Talking about the possibility of Democrats seizing control of the US House of Representatives, he said, &amp;ldquo;could happen . . . could happen.&amp;rdquo;
But the killer line we all must remember came next: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it.

Democrats use refugees like pawns in their perverted and wicked quest for power.
Once upon a time, nearly all asylum seekers were turned away by the United States. These were times when Democrats ran the White House or both Houses of Congress.
Most recently, the Obama administration banned all asylum seekers from Cuba.

                Amendment 1 would turn over Missouri&amp;rsquo;s state and federal gerrymandering to an unelected demographer. This means there&amp;rsquo;s an 8 to 1 chance (87.5%) that the demographer will be a Democrat. Demography is a social science. Social science majors are mostly far left or liberal. Only a handful of social science majors call themselves conservative:
 A 2015 study by psychologist José Duarte, then at Arizona State University, and his colleagues in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, entitled “Political Diversity Will Improve Social Psychological Science,” found that 58 to 66 percent of social scientists are liberal and only 5 to 8 percent conservative and that there are eight Democrats for every Republican.

I should have paid more attention to Scott Adams in those days. Scott used pure statistical reasoning to conclude that the packages probably came from a crazy Trump supporter: base cases. There are more crazy people than there are brilliant criminal strategists who hate Trump.

Unless you&amp;rsquo;re insane. Any sane person would know that a (failed) mail-bomb plot targeting a bunch of Democrats and leftists will only make conservatives look bad.

                I get the feeling a lot of people think mid-term elections are like pre-season hockey. These people think the only election that counts is the presidential election.
These people are, frankly, idiots. Sorry. They are.
What&amp;rsquo;s at stake in less than two weeks is huge. One of the biggest mid-term elections in your lifetime. If you want it reduced to a simple either/or, here it is.
Donald Trump will be an unstoppable swamp drainer and job creator or a lame duck.

                I keep hearing the media say terrible things about women who live in suburbs and went to college. According to everyone from CNN to the Cook Political Report, these college-educated suburban women have no control over their emotions or their hormones. They self-sabotage and sabotage their families just to quell their own emotional urges. In other words, the media say college-educated suburban women are all hysterical. That&amp;rsquo;s a terrible, sexist thing for the CNN to say about these women.

                You probably heard that a bunch of witches are gathering in New York City today to put hexes on Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump, and others. Don&amp;rsquo;t take this lightly. Father Richard Heilman and folks at the Holy League have asked Christians to pray the Lorica of St. Patrick for Justice Kavanaugh, substituting &amp;ldquo;Brett Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Justice Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; for the first person pronouns.
This is a powerful prayer that&amp;rsquo;s more than 1,500 years old!

                One week after Archbishop Carlo Viganò released his bombshell letter, it looks obvious that Pope Francis admits the key allegation: Francis knew McCarrick to be a serial molester, and he returned McCarrick to public ministry anyway. As we&amp;rsquo;ll see later in this post, Pope Francis has a pattern of letting molesters and their protectors off the hook.
Speaks for Itself Did the pope admit to the horrendous allegations directly? Not directly.

                &amp;ldquo;Good luck with your evangelism,&amp;rdquo; my wife said.
We were discussing my plan to become a Catholic Street Evangelist. My first prayer station event is September 16 under the tutelage of a seasoned team leader.
&amp;ldquo;Why do you say it like that?&amp;rdquo; I asked her.
&amp;ldquo;This is kind of a bad time to be out trying to bring people into the Catholic church, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo;
She had a point.
The church has been in sort of a losing streak of late.

I&amp;rsquo;m talking about his recent series of letters and clarifications regarding how Catholics should express their obedience to the pope. Jim is partially right and partially off base.
What Jim Towey Gets Right Jim is right that that conservative Catholics need to be very gracious and obedient when they challenge the pope&amp;rsquo;s formal teaching on matters like the death penalty.

                One man can confirm or deny the central allegation against Pope Francis. The Catholic Church needs that man to step up now.
In an 11-page letter by former US Nuncio (ambassador) Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, Pope Francis is accused of ignoring warnings about Cardinal Timothy McCarrick. Viganò claims he personally delivered the warning to Pope Francis in 2013. The pope allegedly ignored the warning and the dossier on McCarrick in 2013.

 Pope Francis ignored evidence of crimes and overturned punishment imposed by Pope Benedict on the wicked and disgraced Cardinal McCarrick. That&amp;rsquo;s according to a former papal nuncio and corroborated by a former first counselor to the nunciature to the United States speaking on the record. The two men have direct knowledge of the matter.
Pope Francis refused to comment on the allegations that he personally covered up McCarrick&amp;rsquo;s crimes.

                Thousands of religions have sprung up around the world. Most lasted less than a generation. Some lasted longer. Only five have shown the stability and breadth to be called &amp;ldquo;world religions.&amp;rdquo; They are Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam.
The Eastern religions—Buddhism and Hinduism—compartmentalize faith from daily life. They protect believers from the risks of a leap of faith. Philosopher Mortimer Adler dismissed Eastern religions because of this &amp;ldquo;logic-tight compartmentalization.&amp;rdquo; Religions that segregate faith from action dismiss believers of the need to take a leap of faith.

Today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel reading comes from John 6. John chapter 6 is all about the bread of life. In it, Jesus shocks his Jewish followers by announcing that they must eat his flesh and drink his blood to achieve eternal life.
When some of his disciples challenged this formula for immortality, Jesus doubled down, saying:
 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.

Archbishop Robert Carlson of St. Louis asked Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Attorney General, Josh Hawley, to review all of the archdiocese&amp;rsquo;s records regarding abuse cases. Hawley agreed to the Archbishop&amp;rsquo;s request.
Archbishop Carlson deserves our praise and respect for his openness and honesty.

The communists in Russia outlawed religion. While some religions continued to operate, the government seemed to have a particular hatred of Catholics. Russian communists were familiar with the unique power of priests to consecrate the sacrifice and administer sacraments.

                Because of my sinfulness and selfishness, I was out of communion with the blessed sacrament for most of my adult life. To anyone who&amp;rsquo;s never been excommunicated, you cannot imagine the pain and humiliation of being in that state.
Being a coward, I avoided mass. I was too embarrassed. Week after week, my neighbors would see me not going to communion. I&amp;rsquo;d have to get up and let the communicants through, then kneel back down, often alone.

In that workshop, we cite a lot of behavioral science research. We also point out that some behavioral science research is bogus. Up to 60 percent by a recent study (which might have been bogus itself.) So how do you know good science from bad?

So, eventually, God gave up the comforts of heaven and most of the perks of being God to become a man on earth and show us how to do it right. Instead of thanking Him for the tutoring, we ridiculed, tortured, and murdered Him.

In 2014, I wrote:
 I don’t buy the idea that the death penalty is no deterrent. I don’t buy the notion that the death penalty should be banned. I think the availability of such a punishment serves its purpose.

                You made it. If you began the Fast with me, today is the last day of skipping breakfast and lunch. (Unless you decide to makeone-meal-a-day a permanent habit.)
What Fasting Can Do Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened to you during the fast (if you followed the prescription):
 You probably lost about five pounds. Your pants feel looser. You pull your belt a notch tighter. You saved money. (I saved $98.)  You learned that food is an option most of the time.

                Matt Doell pretending to be a Republican is the greatest display of cross-dressing since the Broadway premiere of La Cage Aux Folles.1
If you live in Missouri House district 110 (Eureka, Pacific, Wildwood), Matt Doell has been molesting your mailbox with personal attacks on his opponent, Dottie Bailey. (Read voter reactions to Doell&amp;rsquo;s dirt campaign here and here.)
You might have noticed that Doell (I call him Droopy) never attacks Dottie&amp;rsquo;s positions on issues like jobs, education, the Second Amendment, taxes, crime, etc.

                Personally, I like Jeff Roe, the political consultant.
He called me the night before Ted Cruz announced his run for president. I was honored, frankly. As Senator Cruz&amp;rsquo;s campaign manager, Mr. Roe had much bigger fish to fry that night. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that Jeff holds no grudges. He genuinely cares about the opposing candidates even while he viciously destroys their careers. I have no doubt Mr. Roe has many great qualities as a person, and I know he has amazing talents as a political operative and strategist.

Voters in House District 110 are asking why they received such a &amp;ldquo;disgusting&amp;rdquo; flyer from candidate Matt Doell.
Answer: Probably because he&amp;rsquo;s losing badly.
Matt Doell has decided to get dirty. And personal. And mean. (Horrible internals?)
While Dottie Bailey has knocked doors, attended coffees, and generally met with voters, Matt Doell rubbed elbows with hot-shots and union bosses and avoided anything that looks like an &amp;ldquo;ordinary person.

But the MEC shot Doell down like a hovering duck.
From the MEC&amp;rsquo;s official &amp;ldquo;Wah-wah&amp;rdquo; letter to the Doell campaign:
 Therefore, the Commission is not accepting this complaint.
 Doell&amp;rsquo;s failed complaint centers on my blog posts that criticize his performance as a member of the Rockwood School Board. For your convenience, here&amp;rsquo;s the list of my blogs criticizing Rockwood during Doell&amp;rsquo;s seven-year tenure:

                Many years ago, a company hired a new president.
After several months on the job, this new president learned that most of his employees couldn&amp;rsquo;t pick him out of a line-up. He spent so much time in his office or in meetings or traveling that he rarely met with the people who reported to him.
To fix this problem, he set up a series of lunches. They were off-site at restaurants around town.

                One of the candidates for Missouri House District 110 (Eureka, Wildwood, and Pacific) sent out a mailer to voters today. The mailer talks about &amp;ldquo;local control&amp;rdquo; of education, and many other fine platitudes that poll well. In other news,** while this candidate was on the Rockwood School District board of directors** (the district that serves most of Eureka, Wildwood, and Pacific), **bad things happened**. Like this:
 The Rockwood School District overpaid its longtime construction management company by more than $1.

                I invite you to join a centuries-old tradition: fasting for a cause. Moses and Jesus fasted for 40 days. But this Primary Fast will last only 14. Some fasts require that you eat nothing during the fast. But this Primary Fast lets you eat one full, wonderful meal a day. Did you know that General Stanley McChrystal has lived on just one meal a day for decades. And one meal a day was enough to drive him through the war against al Qaeda.

                One of the candidates running for the state House of Representatives in District 110 has been on the Rockwood School Board since 2011. In a campaign mailer, this candidate claims he&amp;rsquo;s cut taxes in the district. Is that true?
Well, it&amp;rsquo;s true that the property tax rate in Rockwood has been reduced twice during his tenure. But that&amp;rsquo;s not even close to the whole picture. Since the 2010-2011 school year, when this candidate joined the board, Rockwood has raised taxes 5 times.

                Some people complain about politicians not representing their constituents well. I disagree. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my life, all politicians do a great job of representing their constituents. They really do.
If I&amp;rsquo;m right about politicians being 100% true to their constituents, then why are so many voters so unhappy with the people they voted for? It&amp;rsquo;s simple: the voters aren&amp;rsquo;t every politician&amp;rsquo;s constituents. That&amp;rsquo;s right. Not all politicians consider the people who vote for them constituents.

                My mom and dad have two anniversaries. One anniversary celebrates the day my uncle Bob drove them to Hot Springs, Arkansas to elope. The other celebrates the day about a week later when, having learned of their civil nuptials, my grandfather ordered them to go see Father English and set themselves right with the church.
Like father, like son, I guess. Except, the kid&amp;rsquo;s a lot slower. Fifteen years slower.

                It&amp;rsquo;s time. Powerful and corrupt people want to undo the 2016 election. In Washington. In Missouri.
Win or lose, Americans deal with the results of elections. Our commitment to open, public government, of the people, by, the people, for people, has sustained this nation. And made it the greatest nation in the history of humanity.
But dark forces in Missouri want to turn your government into their private club. A club managed by corrupt business who rely on tax dollars to keep their failed enterprises afloat.

back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
but all he kept talking about was Glory Days

&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s this Faughn guy&amp;rsquo;s role in the Greitens&amp;rsquo; investigation?&amp;rdquo; someone asked.
Faughn is the publisher of Missouri Times and a former mayor of Poplar Bluff, Missouri. Papers call him a &amp;ldquo;power broker.&amp;rdquo; Others call him the &amp;ldquo;Candy Man.&amp;rdquo;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the question. &amp;ldquo;Not sure,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;His paper hates Grietens, but that&amp;rsquo;s as much as know. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been to his weird, hidden party pad in Jefferson City.

                “The [Johnson] Treatment” could last anywhere from ten minutes or four hours and it would come whenever and wherever Johnson might find a fellow Senator or politician within his radius. “Its tone could be and included supplication, accusation, cajolery, exuberance, scorn, tears, complaint and the hint of threat.” All of these elements together brought out the spectrum of human emotions. Its velocity was breathtaking, and it was all in one direction.

                A great State Rep decides to give up his seat. The seat previously held by the Speaker of the House and a conservative legend. A seat in, perhaps, the most reliably conservative House district in St. Louis County.
Now, there&amp;rsquo;s a battle for that seat. A battle between a left-leaning Establishment Republican and a grassroots Conservative activist. An activist whose work for the right causes earned a star on Heritage Action&amp;rsquo;s Wall of Honor.

One of the old stories in the Eric Greitens category was my first comments on his book Resilience﻿. My old post talked about why it took me so long to finish the book. And it contained two short passages from the book.

When I read about Schaff&amp;rsquo;s latest endorxement of the Clean Missouri petition initiative, I believed the stories. This is dangerous stuff. If Clean Missouri becomes law, State Senator Rob Schaff&amp;rsquo;s proposal would flip our state legislature from Republican Red to a deep and dirty Democrat Blue.
