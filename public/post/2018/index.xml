      <title>Now Experts Are Worse Than Useless</title>

      <description>Millennials seem to believe anything that comes from the mouth of an &amp;ldquo;expert.&amp;rdquo; Even the older Millennials are probably too green to realize that listening to experts will produce worse results than going with your gut.
It works like this . . . when we go with our gut (or some non-expert&amp;rsquo;s suggestion), we build in a wide margin for error. We recognize the fallibility of our own judgment and proceed with due caution.</description>

      <title>2019: Year of the Fast</title>

      <description>Fasting is probably the healthiest thing you can do for yourself. It&amp;rsquo;s also the cheapest healthy thing you can do. Unlike most diets and exercise plans, supplements, and, especially, trips to a doctor, fasting actually saves money. When you fast, you don&amp;rsquo;t eat.
Further, fasting is the simplest thing you can do to improve your physical and mental health. There are only two things to remember:
 Don&amp;rsquo;t eat. Drink some water.</description>

      <title>Glad I Won&#39;t Be Around</title>

      <description>I was about five or six the first time I heard my mom say, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m glad I won&amp;rsquo;t be around to see it.&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what she was saying. Nonetheless, it felt ominous and unsettling. I let it go.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when I heard it the second time, phrased slightly differenlty: &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t be alive when . . . .&amp;rdquo;
I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what the &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo; was. It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter.</description>

      <description>This is the abbey church at St. Meinrad&amp;rsquo;s Archabbey in St. Meinrad, Indiana.
  My wife and I took a pilgrimage there this weekend. If you live in the St. Louis area, you&amp;rsquo;re only about three hours away from a fascinating piece of church history.
(Here&amp;rsquo;s St. Meinrad&amp;rsquo;s website.)
Mass I loved the mass. I won&amp;rsquo;t spoil it all for you, but I do want to let you know why I loved the mass.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s see if this works, shall we?
I spent all day moving my blog from a self-hosted Wordpress site to a Hugo static site. Since I no longer support advertising, I don&amp;rsquo;t need all the weight of Wordpress. Plus, managing a blog through Github is actually easier for me. I use git professionally. And I pretty much think in Markdown at this point.
The final reason for the move is the change in direction for this blog.</description>

      <description>Elect Hawley.
Retire that wicked witch of the swamp McCaskill so you can walk with a little pride, Missouri. I am 100% voting proudly for Josh Hawley for US Senate, and you will too. No need to say more. Vote for Hawley all the way and silently wonder what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t. (There&amp;rsquo;s something wrong. Say a prayer for them.)
I repeat: **Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s for Hawley 100%. **</description>

      <description>How will God answer our prayers to make America holy again?
For 17 days we&amp;rsquo;ve been praying, going to confession, going to mass as often as we can. Rosaries. Chaplet of St. Michael. Tomorrow, election day, our back-to-back novenas wrap up.
Fr. Heilman asked his Spiritual Warriors to do as many of these daily devotions as possible:
 Pray in a State of Grace (Go to Confession) Believe God will answer our prayers October 20 – October 28 – Novena #1 – Pray the St.</description>

      <title>Election Day Spiritual Warfare</title>

      <description>Polls open in less than 48 hours. History tells us how to win the election with spiritual warfare.
 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we are not contending against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, agains the world rulers of this present darkness, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.</description>

      <title>Perfect Words from Trump</title>

      <description>Even his supporters say President Trump&amp;rsquo;s speech is sometimes inelegant. Intentional or accidental, the president&amp;rsquo;s word choice often triggers his enemies and sometimes confuses his many supporters. But on Friday President Trump had the best words for sure.
Talking about the possibility of Democrats seizing control of the US House of Representatives, he said, &amp;ldquo;could happen . . . could happen.&amp;rdquo;
But the killer line we all must remember came next: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it.</description>

      <title>Democrats Hate Asylum Seekers From Commie Countries</title>

      <description>WARNING: College-educated suburban women should not read this article because it will punch holes in their unicorn-and-rainbows delusions.
Democrats use refugees like pawns in their perverted and wicked quest for power.
Once upon a time, nearly all asylum seekers were turned away by the United States. These were times when Democrats ran the White House or both Houses of Congress.
Most recently, the Obama administration banned all asylum seekers from Cuba.</description>

      <description>Lots, actually. But one Stoic practice that&amp;rsquo;s central to Christianity seems pertinent on All Hallow&amp;rsquo;s Eve: memento mori.
Remember your death. Remember, you will die. We all die. All the tech billionaires spending their fortunes trying to live forever will die. No matter how young and healthy you are, time is running through your hourglass. It will run out. And you probably won&amp;rsquo;t know when. For over a year I&amp;rsquo;ve carried a challenge coin that reminds me of my death:</description>

      <description>If you read a lot of business and personal improvement blogs, you know they feed a lot of tips for living a better life. By &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; they mean making more money, getting a promotion, being more productive, whatever.
Are those things really what makes life better? If so, why do so many successful people burn out? John Belushi, River Phoenix, Amy Winehouse, Janice Joplin, Michael Jackson. Is it show business? Well, look what&amp;rsquo;s happening to Elon Musk.</description>

      <title>This could make Missouri a blue state fast</title>

      <description>Amendment 1 would turn over Missouri&amp;rsquo;s state and federal gerrymandering to an unelected demographer. This means there&amp;rsquo;s an 8 to 1 chance (87.5%) that the demographer will be a Democrat. Demography is a social science. Social science majors are mostly far left or liberal. Only a handful of social science majors call themselves conservative:
 A 2015 study by psychologist José Duarte, then at Arizona State University, and his colleagues in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, entitled “Political Diversity Will Improve Social Psychological Science,” found that 58 to 66 percent of social scientists are liberal and only 5 to 8 percent conservative and that there are eight Democrats for every Republican.</description>

      <description>A couple of days back I said the mail &amp;ldquo;bombs&amp;rdquo; looked like a false flag. But I left open the possibility of a crazy Republican. Boy, am I glad I gave myself that out.
I should have paid more attention to Scott Adams in those days. Scott used pure statistical reasoning to conclude that the packages probably came from a crazy Trump supporter: base cases. There are more crazy people than there are brilliant criminal strategists who hate Trump.</description>

      <description>Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a false flag. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not. But it looks like a false flag.
All these mail bombs I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. You have to ask yourself: &amp;ldquo;who would do this two weeks before an election?&amp;rdquo;
If you&amp;rsquo;re a conservative, do you do something that&amp;rsquo;s bound to inspire sympathy for lefties right before an election? No.
Unless you&amp;rsquo;re insane. Any sane person would know that a (failed) mail-bomb plot targeting a bunch of Democrats and leftists will only make conservatives look bad.</description>

      <description>I get the feeling a lot of people think mid-term elections are like pre-season hockey. These people think the only election that counts is the presidential election.
These people are, frankly, idiots. Sorry. They are.
What&amp;rsquo;s at stake in less than two weeks is huge. One of the biggest mid-term elections in your lifetime. If you want it reduced to a simple either/or, here it is.
Donald Trump will be an unstoppable swamp drainer and job creator or a lame duck.</description>

      <description>I keep hearing the media say terrible things about women who live in suburbs and went to college. According to everyone from CNN to the Cook Political Report, these college-educated suburban women have no control over their emotions or their hormones. They self-sabotage and sabotage their families just to quell their own emotional urges. In other words, the media say college-educated suburban women are all hysterical. That&amp;rsquo;s a terrible, sexist thing for the CNN to say about these women.</description>

      <description>You probably heard that a bunch of witches are gathering in New York City today to put hexes on Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump, and others. Don&amp;rsquo;t take this lightly. Father Richard Heilman and folks at the Holy League have asked Christians to pray the Lorica of St. Patrick for Justice Kavanaugh, substituting &amp;ldquo;Brett Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Justice Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; for the first person pronouns.
This is a powerful prayer that&amp;rsquo;s more than 1,500 years old!</description>

      <description>No, it&amp;rsquo;s not more money. Nor better ads. Nor snarkier tweets. Nor more Facebook friends. Keeping the US House of Representatives out of the hands of the #AngryDemocratMob requires supernatural help. We cannot do it alone.
The other side has supernatural help. The other side cooperates with Satan for power on earth. Therefore, our battle is not with mere mortals alone, but with demons working in concert with men. Even if we were to assemble a vast army of mere mortals, we will lose.</description>

      <description>In less than two years, Donald J. Trump has already achieved more as President of the United States than most of his predecessors did in eight or more years.  Trump has eliminated more federal regulations than all past presidents combined Trump pushed through Congress one of the largest tax cuts in history Trump has renegotiated numerous trade agreements, including NAFTA Trump has reinvigorated American manufacturing Trump has sparked the strongest economy in US history Trump has reduce unemployment for blacks and Hispanics to their lowest levels in history Trump has achieved a remarkable 35% favorability rating among blacks, the highest for a Republican in modern times Trump has placed on the Supreme Court two solidly conservative jurists Trump has given Republicans the courage to stand up to evil progressives Trump has reunited the warring factions of the Republican base Trump has changed Americans&amp;rsquo; expectations of the office of president Trump has redefined what it means to be presidential Trump has exposed America&amp;rsquo;s domestic enemies and left vulnerable  Even those who viscerally hate Donald Trump—and there are many—cannot deny that Trump&amp;rsquo;s impact on the USA and on the world exceeds even his impact on the New York City skyline.</description>

      <description>I predicted that Judge Brett Kavanaugh would be rejected by the Senate. I was wrong. In a few minutes from the time I write, the Senate will confirm Judge Kavanaugh by a vote of 50 ayes to 48 nays. One Republican will vote &amp;ldquo;present.&amp;rdquo;
What went wrong? I underestimated the courage and fortitude of three Senators: Republicans Jeff Flake and Susan Collins, and Democrat &amp;ldquo;Lonely&amp;rdquo; Joe Manchin. I truly believed Flake would put his hatred of Donald Trump before the good of the country and vote nay.</description>

      <description>The trains to Auschwitz ran on time. Brutal dictatorships love efficiency. Stalin. Hitler. Mao. Pol Pot. The best mass murderers are efficient. Psychopaths feed on efficiency. They kill because killing is the most efficient means to their end. They kill to rid society of inefficient people. People who introduce inefficiencies to the system. People who get in the way.
Democracy is inefficient. As are all republics. (A republic is any form of government that&amp;rsquo;s open to the public.</description>

      <description>Very scary thought: If the Democrats take over the House and Senate in January, they could impeach both Trump and Pence and try them in the Senate at the same time making Nancy Pelosi president.
You&amp;rsquo;ve Never Lived in a Time Like This One I&amp;rsquo;m almost old enough to remember the Democrat National Convention of 1968. Almost. What a show. Hippies and Yippies marching, tear gas, Mayor Daley, Buckley threatening to punch Gore Vidal on live TV.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I missed it.
A 54-day novena for our nation. It ends on October 7 with the Rosary Coast-to-Coast. Which means it started before I learned of either. But that&amp;rsquo;s okay. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to do the novena to do say the Rosary. Just show up at any of the Rosary stations around the area at 3:00 on October 7. I&amp;rsquo;m helping organize one location at the Black Madonna Shrine in Eureka/Pacific area.</description>

      <description>Scott Adams predicts Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed. I don&amp;rsquo;t. I predict his nomination won&amp;rsquo;t get out of committee. Jeff Flake of the judiciary committee will vote no. Trump will have to nominate someone else. He&amp;rsquo;ll nominate Amy Coney Barrett. There will be no hearing for Judge Amy. Diane Feinstein will have no opportunity to spew her anti-Catholic bigotry.
She will pass the committee about 72 hours after the Senate receives the nomination.</description>

On October 7, Christians around the world will unsheathe the most powerful weapon with which God has ever armed his people. We will, together, wage a great battle in the spiritual war of our age. What is this weapon? What is the spiritual war? If you&amp;rsquo;re paying attention at all, you know the spiritual war we&amp;rsquo;re all in.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve had one live in my house. You underestimate the depths of their hatred for America. They hate it. They hate us. They especially hate themselves. When you hate yourself, nothing is beneath you. When you hate yourself, you debase yourself. When you hate yourself, you are capable and willing to do anything.</description>

      <description>The holy Rosary is a powerful weapon!
St. Josemaria Escriva
 On Sunday, October 7 at 3:30 p.m. Central (and simultaneously across the USA and the whole world), millions will say the Rosary in unison. Will you join us?
 We are at war. A war without borders, where no man is exempt but where most haven’t recognized, let alone been trained, to fight. Casualties often go unseen, but very few are left unwounded.</description>

A few decades ago, it still applied to the training of young humans, but that&amp;rsquo;s passè now. Yet, of all the minor virtues, this one seems the most lacking, the most valuable, and most difficult for libertarians like me. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of obedience. My Lesson in Obedience Obedience, like many other virtues, is easy to talk about and difficult to execute.</description>

      <description>Stella Is My Teacher This is probably disturbing to theologians and apologists, but it makes sense to me. When I struggle with how to relate personally to Christ, I think of the way my dog relates to me. And when I wonder how God feels about me, I think about how I feel about my dog. Dogs treat their people the way we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to treat God. And we respond to dogs in a way that teaches us how God responds to us.</description>

      <description>A faction in America seems hellbent on destroying the country in order to save it from Donald Trump. What do we owe them?
For many years, I wrote and preached that we owe them contempt and anger. That we must fight them tooth and nail. And that we must prevail.
And we did. And our victories led to bigger battles. The thrill of victory proved fleeting.
Don&amp;rsquo;t you hope for a victory that lasts?</description>

      <description>You might think I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty hard on Pope Francis lately. I&amp;rsquo;ve questioned whether his refusal to deny Archbishop Viganò&amp;rsquo;s accusations. And I&amp;rsquo;ve indicated that, if the allegations are true, the pope&amp;rsquo;s resignation might be the best thing for the Church.
Please understand that my posts are about seeking justice for the many victims of this scandal, includes the many faithful who never directly abused by a priest but, nonetheless, have been harmed by the scandal.</description>

      <description>One week after Archbishop Carlo Viganò released his bombshell letter, it looks obvious that Pope Francis admits the key allegation: Francis knew McCarrick to be a serial molester, and he returned McCarrick to public ministry anyway. As we&amp;rsquo;ll see later in this post, Pope Francis has a pattern of letting molesters and their protectors off the hook.
Speaks for Itself Did the pope admit to the horrendous allegations directly? Not directly.</description>

We were discussing my plan to become a Catholic Street Evangelist. My first prayer station event is September 16 under the tutelage of a seasoned team leader.
&amp;ldquo;Why do you say it like that?&amp;rdquo; I asked her.
&amp;ldquo;This is kind of a bad time to be out trying to bring people into the Catholic church, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo;
She had a point.
The church has been in sort of a losing streak of late.</description>

      <description>God bless Jim Towey and the work of his school, Ave Maria University. I am confident that he is confused, and we should pray for clarity.
I&amp;rsquo;m talking about his recent series of letters and clarifications regarding how Catholics should express their obedience to the pope. Jim is partially right and partially off base.
What Jim Towey Gets Right Jim is right that that conservative Catholics need to be very gracious and obedient when they challenge the pope&amp;rsquo;s formal teaching on matters like the death penalty.</description>

      <description>One man can confirm or deny the central allegation against Pope Francis. The Catholic Church needs that man to step up now.
In an 11-page letter by former US Nuncio (ambassador) Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, Pope Francis is accused of ignoring warnings about Cardinal Timothy McCarrick. Viganò claims he personally delivered the warning to Pope Francis in 2013. The pope allegedly ignored the warning and the dossier on McCarrick in 2013.</description>

 Pope Francis ignored evidence of crimes and overturned punishment imposed by Pope Benedict on the wicked and disgraced Cardinal McCarrick. That&amp;rsquo;s according to a former papal nuncio and corroborated by a former first counselor to the nunciature to the United States speaking on the record. The two men have direct knowledge of the matter.
Pope Francis refused to comment on the allegations that he personally covered up McCarrick&amp;rsquo;s crimes.</description>

      <description>Thousands of religions have sprung up around the world. Most lasted less than a generation. Some lasted longer. Only five have shown the stability and breadth to be called &amp;ldquo;world religions.&amp;rdquo; They are Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam.
The Eastern religions—Buddhism and Hinduism—compartmentalize faith from daily life. They protect believers from the risks of a leap of faith. Philosopher Mortimer Adler dismissed Eastern religions because of this &amp;ldquo;logic-tight compartmentalization.&amp;rdquo; Religions that segregate faith from action dismiss believers of the need to take a leap of faith.</description>

      <description>Why do you stay a Catholic?
Today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel reading comes from John 6. John chapter 6 is all about the bread of life. In it, Jesus shocks his Jewish followers by announcing that they must eat his flesh and drink his blood to achieve eternal life.
When some of his disciples challenged this formula for immortality, Jesus doubled down, saying:
 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</description>

Archbishop Robert Carlson of St. Louis asked Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Attorney General, Josh Hawley, to review all of the archdiocese&amp;rsquo;s records regarding abuse cases. Hawley agreed to the Archbishop&amp;rsquo;s request.
Archbishop Carlson deserves our praise and respect for his openness and honesty.</description>

      <description>I heard a story a long time ago. From a woman who escaped the Soviet Union and came to America.
She told us how lucky we are in America to have priests. She urged us to pray in thanksgiving every day that we have priests.
The communists in Russia outlawed religion. While some religions continued to operate, the government seemed to have a particular hatred of Catholics. Russian communists were familiar with the unique power of priests to consecrate the sacrifice and administer sacraments.</description>

      <description>Because of my sinfulness and selfishness, I was out of communion with the blessed sacrament for most of my adult life. To anyone who&amp;rsquo;s never been excommunicated, you cannot imagine the pain and humiliation of being in that state.
Being a coward, I avoided mass. I was too embarrassed. Week after week, my neighbors would see me not going to communion. I&amp;rsquo;d have to get up and let the communicants through, then kneel back down, often alone.</description>

This morning, I tried to listen in silence for God&amp;rsquo;s answers to my questions.
What do we say about the news out of Pennsylvania? How do we answer those who taunt and ridicule the Church? How do we settle our anger at the priests and bishops and cardinals who protected the pederasts for decades? How do we reconcile the hideous criminality of those men with the uncountable graces God freely gave them through the many sacraments they&amp;rsquo;ve received?</description>

In that workshop, we cite a lot of behavioral science research. We also point out that some behavioral science research is bogus. Up to 60 percent by a recent study (which might have been bogus itself.) So how do you know good science from bad?
Look for consistency. I&amp;rsquo;ll give you an example.</description>

      <description>God made man and woman, and man and woman screwed everything up. So, eventually, God gave up the comforts of heaven and most of the perks of being God to become a man on earth and show us how to do it right. Instead of thanking Him for the tutoring, we ridiculed, tortured, and murdered Him.
Lucky for us, a few guys took notes while Jesus was here. And they published them.</description>

      <description>Just a short note to wish my friend Jim a happy birthday.
Jim doesn&amp;rsquo;t know this, but several years ago he planted a seed in my heart that has broken through the crust of the earth and is now starting to bloom. For his birthday, I want him to know how grateful I am for his wisdom.
When Jim was in St. Louis, he helped a great deal in getting the St.</description>

      <description>Last week, Pope Francis approved a change to the Catechism of the Catholic Church.
Longtime readers might recall that my views on the death penalty are a bit nuanced. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t always have the courage to express it.
In 2014, I wrote:
 I don’t buy the idea that the death penalty is no deterrent. I don’t buy the notion that the death penalty should be banned. I think the availability of such a punishment serves its purpose.</description>

      <description>Not all television is bad.
Yesterday, I wrote about a dark and unpleasant future. [Read &amp;ldquo;What Should We Do Next?&amp;quot;] I wrote about the possibility of rapid social decay into civil war or oppression of Christians, Jews, and political conservatives. Essentially, the downfall of Western Civilization.
Some people would expect me to recommend that we all prepare for combat. I don&amp;rsquo;t. I do recommend people prepare for hardship. (I&amp;rsquo;ll write about how in the future.</description>

      <description>Happiness Did you know that the word &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;blessed?&amp;rdquo;
Neither did I. But when I heard this on EWTN Radio the other day, I remembered there are two translations of the Beatitudes. One version goes with &amp;ldquo;Blessed are . . .&amp;rdquo; and the other with &amp;ldquo;Happy are . . . .&amp;rdquo; So, I guess it&amp;rsquo;s true. The words are interchangeable.
Happiness, then, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean walking around in some lithium-induced state of bliss.</description>

      <description>Dottie Bailey defeated Rockwood School Board President Matt Doell in the Republican primary for Missouri House District 110. Dottie now faces Democrat Cody Kelley in November.
Dottie is a phenomenal campaigner. She knocked on over 4,000 doors between April and August. Her efforts resulted in an enormous 19 percentage-point win despite being outspent by her opponent. Making Dottie&amp;rsquo;s more impressive is the fact that Doell had been elected to the Rockwood board three times while this was Dottie&amp;rsquo;s first race ever.</description>

What Fasting Can Do Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened to you during the fast (if you followed the prescription):
 You probably lost about five pounds. Your pants feel looser. You pull your belt a notch tighter. You saved money. (I saved $98.)  You learned that food is an option most of the time.</description>

The job is easy. Wear a Dottie Bailey t-shirt in front of a polling place. As voters approach, say &amp;ldquo;Thank you for coming out to vote today, and we appreciate your support for Dottie Bailey.
Why Dottie Dottie is the true conservative, grassroots activist in the race. Her primary opponent is an old nemesis of the Tea Party.</description>

      <description>Matt Doell pretending to be a Republican is the greatest display of cross-dressing since the Broadway premiere of La Cage Aux Folles.1
If you live in Missouri House district 110 (Eureka, Pacific, Wildwood), Matt Doell has been molesting your mailbox with personal attacks on his opponent, Dottie Bailey. (Read voter reactions to Doell&amp;rsquo;s dirt campaign here and here.)
You might have noticed that Doell (I call him Droopy) never attacks Dottie&amp;rsquo;s positions on issues like jobs, education, the Second Amendment, taxes, crime, etc.</description>

      <description>Personally, I like Jeff Roe, the political consultant.
He called me the night before Ted Cruz announced his run for president. I was honored, frankly. As Senator Cruz&amp;rsquo;s campaign manager, Mr. Roe had much bigger fish to fry that night. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that Jeff holds no grudges. He genuinely cares about the opposing candidates even while he viciously destroys their careers. I have no doubt Mr. Roe has many great qualities as a person, and I know he has amazing talents as a political operative and strategist.</description>

Voters in House District 110 are asking why they received such a &amp;ldquo;disgusting&amp;rdquo; flyer from candidate Matt Doell.
Answer: Probably because he&amp;rsquo;s losing badly.
Matt Doell has decided to get dirty. And personal. And mean. (Horrible internals?)
While Dottie Bailey has knocked doors, attended coffees, and generally met with voters, Matt Doell rubbed elbows with hot-shots and union bosses and avoided anything that looks like an &amp;ldquo;ordinary person.</description>

      <description>Matt Doell made a desperate attempt to sick the MEC on Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View. Makes me so happy.
But the MEC shot Doell down like a hovering duck.
From the MEC&amp;rsquo;s official &amp;ldquo;Wah-wah&amp;rdquo; letter to the Doell campaign:
 Therefore, the Commission is not accepting this complaint.
 Doell&amp;rsquo;s failed complaint centers on my blog posts that criticize his performance as a member of the Rockwood School Board. For your convenience, here&amp;rsquo;s the list of my blogs criticizing Rockwood during Doell&amp;rsquo;s seven-year tenure:</description>

** $1.2 million wasted in double payments ** Contracts awarded to a construction company that had one of its executives on the board ** Feeble, &amp;ldquo;arrogant&amp;rdquo; response to the audit from board members ** Bad management!
But the worst example of cronyism and arrogance went largely unreported. (The great Elliott Davis caught it, though. Video to follow.)

      <description>Many years ago, a company hired a new president.
After several months on the job, this new president learned that most of his employees couldn&amp;rsquo;t pick him out of a line-up. He spent so much time in his office or in meetings or traveling that he rarely met with the people who reported to him.
To fix this problem, he set up a series of lunches. They were off-site at restaurants around town.</description>

      <description>I invite you to join a centuries-old tradition: fasting for a cause. Moses and Jesus fasted for 40 days. But this Primary Fast will last only 14. Some fasts require that you eat nothing during the fast. But this Primary Fast lets you eat one full, wonderful meal a day. Did you know that General Stanley McChrystal has lived on just one meal a day for decades. And one meal a day was enough to drive him through the war against al Qaeda.</description>

      <description>One of the candidates running for the state House of Representatives in District 110 has been on the Rockwood School Board since 2011. In a campaign mailer, this candidate claims he&amp;rsquo;s cut taxes in the district. Is that true?
Well, it&amp;rsquo;s true that the property tax rate in Rockwood has been reduced twice during his tenure. But that&amp;rsquo;s not even close to the whole picture. Since the 2010-2011 school year, when this candidate joined the board, Rockwood has raised taxes 5 times.</description>

      <description>Some people complain about politicians not representing their constituents well. I disagree. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my life, all politicians do a great job of representing their constituents. They really do.
If I&amp;rsquo;m right about politicians being 100% true to their constituents, then why are so many voters so unhappy with the people they voted for? It&amp;rsquo;s simple: the voters aren&amp;rsquo;t every politician&amp;rsquo;s constituents. That&amp;rsquo;s right. Not all politicians consider the people who vote for them constituents.</description>

If you want to be as great as the founding fathers or as prolific as Tolkien and Lewis, get off social media and get to a bar. I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you why.

      <description>Governor Eric Greitens resigned. Friend of the lobbyists, Mike Parson, became Missouri&amp;rsquo;s governor. In the words of someone who knows the new governor well, Mike Parson will &amp;ldquo;sell everything that isn&amp;rsquo;t nailed down.&amp;rdquo;
For those of us who believe in limited government that doesn&amp;rsquo;t put its thumb on the scale of achievement, it&amp;rsquo;s time to panic and despair, right?
Wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s never time to panic or despair. And we know this from two of the greatest philosophers of all time, Epictetus and Seneca.</description>

      <description>My mom and dad have two anniversaries. One anniversary celebrates the day my uncle Bob drove them to Hot Springs, Arkansas to elope. The other celebrates the day about a week later when, having learned of their civil nuptials, my grandfather ordered them to go see Father English and set themselves right with the church.
Like father, like son, I guess. Except, the kid&amp;rsquo;s a lot slower. Fifteen years slower.</description>

      <description>Remember this?
   I&amp;rsquo;m sure you have some cosmic rationale
But here you are with your faith
And your Peter Pan advice
You have no scars on your face
And you cannot handle pressure
The pressure
Pressure
1, 2, 3, 4 Pressure!

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time. Powerful and corrupt people want to undo the 2016 election. In Washington. In Missouri.
Win or lose, Americans deal with the results of elections. Our commitment to open, public government, of the people, by, the people, for people, has sustained this nation. And made it the greatest nation in the history of humanity.
But dark forces in Missouri want to turn your government into their private club. A club managed by corrupt business who rely on tax dollars to keep their failed enterprises afloat.</description>

      <description>I had a friend was a big baseball player
back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
but all he kept talking about was Glory Days

      <description>When you hide the name and simply list accomplishments, any reasonable person would agree that Donald Trump has done more good for the country than any president in living memory.
Economy ** African-America unemployment lowest in history ** Hispanic unemployment lowest in history ** Female unemployment lowest in 18 years ** Stock market up 35% since *election
** Manufacturing jobs growing for *first time in decades ** Steelworkers going to back to work after humiliating layoffs ** Regulatory cuts have reinvigorated dying industries ** Millions of new jobs planned across the country</description>

      <description>Scott Faughn&amp;rsquo;s name came up in conversation last week.
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s this Faughn guy&amp;rsquo;s role in the Greitens&amp;rsquo; investigation?&amp;rdquo; someone asked.
Faughn is the publisher of Missouri Times and a former mayor of Poplar Bluff, Missouri. Papers call him a &amp;ldquo;power broker.&amp;rdquo; Others call him the &amp;ldquo;Candy Man.&amp;rdquo;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the question. &amp;ldquo;Not sure,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;His paper hates Grietens, but that&amp;rsquo;s as much as know. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been to his weird, hidden party pad in Jefferson City.</description>

      <description>“The [Johnson] Treatment” could last anywhere from ten minutes or four hours and it would come whenever and wherever Johnson might find a fellow Senator or politician within his radius. “Its tone could be and included supplication, accusation, cajolery, exuberance, scorn, tears, complaint and the hint of threat.” All of these elements together brought out the spectrum of human emotions. Its velocity was breathtaking, and it was all in one direction.</description>

      <description>A great State Rep decides to give up his seat. The seat previously held by the Speaker of the House and a conservative legend. A seat in, perhaps, the most reliably conservative House district in St. Louis County.
Now, there&amp;rsquo;s a battle for that seat. A battle between a left-leaning Establishment Republican and a grassroots Conservative activist. An activist whose work for the right causes earned a star on Heritage Action&amp;rsquo;s Wall of Honor.</description>

      <description>This is the most important documentary of the decade.
https://youtu.be/X_AyP9SAEJc  What can you do? Start close to home.
Don&amp;rsquo;t tolerate intolerance. Don&amp;rsquo;t curb your tongue. And don&amp;rsquo;t elect whimps to government. Missouri&amp;rsquo;s legislature needs every person with spine it find.
You don&amp;rsquo;t want a mouse in the House.
And Dottie Bailey has no places for safe spaces.
If you live in Wildwood, Eureka, or Pacific areas, vote for Dottie Bailey.</description>

      <description>People have an innate sense of justice.   One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful,3 and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, “She is Bathsheba,the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.” 4 Then David sent messengers to get her.</description>

One of the old stories in the Eric Greitens category was my first comments on his book Resilience﻿. My old post talked about why it took me so long to finish the book. And it contained two short passages from the book.</description>

      <description>People who spend a lot of time in Jefferson City say Rob Schaff is so consumed with Governor Greitens that he&amp;rsquo;s completely lost his marbles. (I don&amp;rsquo;t know. Just telling you what I hear.)
When I read about Schaff&amp;rsquo;s latest endorxement of the Clean Missouri petition initiative, I believed the stories. This is dangerous stuff. If Clean Missouri becomes law, State Senator Rob Schaff&amp;rsquo;s proposal would flip our state legislature from Republican Red to a deep and dirty Democrat Blue.</description>

      <description>*Ninety-eight percent of Americans - plumbers, dentists, bus drivers - have skin in the game. We have to worry about the 2 percent - the intellectuals and politicians making the big decisions who don’t have skin in the game and are messing the whole thing up for everybody else. Thirty years ago, the French National Assembly was composed of shop owners, farmers, doctors, veterinarians, and small-town lawyers—people involved in daily activities.</description>

      <description>O Divine Poesy, goddess, daughter of Zeus, sustain for me this song of the various-minded man who, after he had plundered the innermost citadel of hallowed Troy, was made to stay grievously about the coasts of men, the sport of their customs, good and bad, while his heart, through all the sea-faring, ached with an agony to redeem himself and bring his company safe home. Vain hope – for them.</description>

      <description>We all thought it.
&amp;ldquo;This time, for sure, McCaskill goes down.&amp;rdquo;
We&amp;rsquo;ve thought it before and been disappointed. But this time is different, right? This time, we have that up-and-coming Attorney General who&amp;rsquo;s backed by conservatives and establishment Republicans alike. A guy equally at home at a Tea Party conference or a Jack Danforth backyard barbecue. This time, for sure.
But this time looks like another disappointment for Missouri Republicans hoping to send another Republican to the US Senate.</description>

      <description>I gave up news for Lent.  I also stayed away from blogging. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to have fewer opinions about fewer things. When you have a lot of opinions about a lot of things, nothing is more important than anything else. But that&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous. Some things are more important than others. Some questions must be answered before others.  So I gave up news for Lent, and I might never go back.</description>

      <description>Nothing has shaken my support for Eric Greitens.
People ask me if I&amp;rsquo;m sorry I supported him. Are you kidding?
Governor Greitens signed Right to Work. Something I&amp;rsquo;ve supported since it first appeared in the 1970s.
Governor Greitens strengthened Missouri&amp;rsquo;s strong Right to Life policies.
Governor Greitens is rebuilding Missouri jobs and wages.
Governor Greitens is doing exactly what we elected him to do for Missouri.
Is he perfect? Of course not.</description>

      <description>You probably would like to know how to spot a very stable genius. It&amp;rsquo;s a skill that can come in handy. (Free Bonus: I&amp;rsquo;ll point you to the funniest thing I ever read in my life. Just because I like you. But first . . .)
Well, today, Donald J. Trump gave us a lesson in genius detection.
With the MSM chanting &amp;ldquo;mentally unfit&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;stupid,&amp;rdquo; our very stable genius president took to his favorite persuasion tool, Twitter.</description>
