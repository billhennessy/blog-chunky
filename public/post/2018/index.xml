      <title>Now Experts Are Worse Than Useless</title>

      <description>Millennials seem to believe anything that comes from the mouth of an &amp;ldquo;expert.&amp;rdquo; Even the older Millennials are probably too green to realize that listening to experts will produce worse results than going with your gut.
It works like this . . . when we go with our gut (or some non-expert&amp;rsquo;s suggestion), we build in a wide margin for error. We recognize the fallibility of our own judgment and proceed with due caution.</description>

      <description>Fasting is probably the healthiest thing you can do for yourself. It&amp;rsquo;s also the cheapest healthy thing you can do. Unlike most diets and exercise plans, supplements, and, especially, trips to a doctor, fasting actually saves money. When you fast, you don&amp;rsquo;t eat.
Further, fasting is the simplest thing you can do to improve your physical and mental health. There are only two things to remember:
 Don&amp;rsquo;t eat. Drink some water.</description>

      <title>Glad I Won&#39;t Be Around</title>

      <description>I was about five or six the first time I heard my mom say, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m glad I won&amp;rsquo;t be around to see it.&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what she was saying. Nonetheless, it felt ominous and unsettling. I let it go.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when I heard it the second time, phrased slightly differenlty: &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t be alive when . . . .&amp;rdquo;
I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what the &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo; was. It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter.</description>

      <description>This is the abbey church at St. Meinrad&amp;rsquo;s Archabbey in St. Meinrad, Indiana.
  My wife and I took a pilgrimage there this weekend. If you live in the St. Louis area, you&amp;rsquo;re only about three hours away from a fascinating piece of church history.
(Here&amp;rsquo;s St. Meinrad&amp;rsquo;s website.)
Mass I loved the mass. I won&amp;rsquo;t spoil it all for you, but I do want to let you know why I loved the mass.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s see if this works, shall we?
I spent all day moving my blog from a self-hosted Wordpress site to a Hugo static site. Since I no longer support advertising, I don&amp;rsquo;t need all the weight of Wordpress. Plus, managing a blog through Github is actually easier for me. I use git professionally. And I pretty much think in Markdown at this point.
The final reason for the move is the change in direction for this blog.</description>
