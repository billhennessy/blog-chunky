                You might have thought I was paranoid for wondering if some people in the CIA and the Deep State are plotting a coup to overturn our recent election.
The Wall Street Journal seems to agree with my conclusion: a coup attempt is going on in America. Rogue actors within the CIA, all of the major leftist media (New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS), and probably major defense contractors seem to be involved, though the Wall Street Journal stops short of accusing advertisers.

                Call me paranoid, but it seems Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s chances of taking the oath of office for President are diminishing every day.
You might find yourself wondering why the CIA would plot a coup against Trump and his supporters. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t wondered about a CIA coup, you should.** Focus your awareness for a moment on what Trump means to the people of the Deep State.**
The Deep State involves those people and institutions that have insulated themselves from the consequences of elections.

                Many powerful interests around the world loathe Donald Trump and the people who elected him. There&amp;rsquo;s no disputing that.
One of those powerful interests is the Central Intelligence Agency. One of the CIA&amp;rsquo;s own, Evan McMullin, attempted to disrupt the election. Like Bay of Pigs and Saddam&amp;rsquo;s weapons of mass destruction, that CIA plot failed. Even George Will admits the CIA makes some horrible, deadly mistakes. And sometimes those mistakes come from seeing the results they want to see, not the results presented.

                No one saw this coming.
In the month since the election on November 8, America burst out of the longest economic malaise since the Great Depression. Historians will credit the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. Those historians will be right, of course, but how can that be? President Trump won&amp;rsquo;t take office until Friday, January 20, 2017. Today is December 8, 2016. Yet Trump has already transformed America more in four weeks than Barack Obama did in eight years.

He pulled out is cell phone and decided to call the cop again. But the phone buzzed in his hand before he could find the number.
“Hello,” Roger said.

“Hi. Ms. Mateo. Yeah, we met in August.”

                Kellogg sells mostly simple carbohydrates in the form of breakfast cereal and snacks. Their ad agencies make you think their foods are wholesome and safe. They&amp;rsquo;re not. They&amp;rsquo;re mostly simple carbohydrates (grains and sugar) that produce a glycemic shock when eaten. And foods that produce glycemic shock seem to be deadlier than cigarettes. At least that&amp;rsquo;s the suggestion from a recent study at the University of Texas.
The study of 2,000 lung cancer patients and 2,500 people without lung cancer should raise concern.

                Tonight, Donald Trump delivered what will become the new standard of presidential oratory in Cincinnati, OH. President-elect Trump thanked Ohio voters for a landslide victory in the state with a barnburner of a speech that rivaled his most animated and colorful rally speeches during the 2015-2016 campaign.
The art of the speech will never be the same.
Frequently breaking from prepared remarks, Trump attacked the dishonest media, mocked a leftist reporter who cried when Hillary lost, and reminded voters, &amp;ldquo;Folks, how many times did we hear this?

                Roger Thompson had completed his checklist. He’d learned from Jack Murphy, his friend and attorney, that the police sergeant seemed cooperative.
With his tasks out of the way, he knew it was time to deal with his wife, Natalie.
Natalie and Roger didn’t see eye to eye politically. Natalie described herself as a progressive. Even though they rarely discussed politics, Roger knew Natalie was politically active before they got married. She worked a lot of referendum campaigns in college and after.

Forty-two minutes later, Flanders was parked and walking into the lobby of modern, glass and stainless steel building.

                Jill Stein has raised nearly $7 million in an effort to overturn election results in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. She has no chance of winning any of those states, and Hillary Clinton has joined Team Stein.
So what&amp;rsquo;s the point?
Apparently,Stein and Clinton want the recounts to miss their December 19 deadline. December 19 is the Constitutionally mandated Electoral College vote. If the recounts are incomplete on the 19th, voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania will be disenfranchised, no candidate will have 270 electoral votes, and the election will be thrown to the US House of Representatives.

While you should read all of The Fourth Turning by generational historians William Strauss and Neil Howe, here&amp;rsquo;s one of their predictions for this point in time. The prediction was published in 1997:
 The economy will in time recover from its early and vertiginous reversals. Late in the Crisis, with trust and hope and urgency growing fast, it may even achieve unprecedented levels of efficiency and production.

                Every Constitutional conservative knows there&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as &amp;ldquo;states&amp;rsquo; rights.&amp;rdquo; Only people have rights. Governments have powers. People have the right to grant government powers. Governments have no power to assume powers not granted by the people. Anyone who says &amp;ldquo;states&amp;rsquo; rights&amp;rdquo; needs a basic course in political philosophy.
For years, a few conservatives mistakenly defended &amp;ldquo;states&amp;rsquo; rights&amp;rdquo; when they meant to say &amp;ldquo;federalism.&amp;rdquo; When conservatives made this error, the left jumped all over them.

                Roger, David, and Natalie, drove home from the hospital in relative silence. It was already dark at six-thirty. Traffic was still snarled as drivers got used to the end of daylight savings.
When they arrived home, David went to his bedroom and Natalie followed. The post-concussion protocol called for lots of rest, no electronics, and soft lighting. David went straight to bed.
Roger walked into his home office with a glass of whiskey.

“I’m Roger Thompson. My son David was brought here,” he said.
The woman at the desk smiled at him, then typed on her keyboard. “Can I see your driver’s license please?” she asked Roger.

Language changes. Sometimes those changes alter what things mean. And because of the odd way the brain deals with language, some changes create constant confusion in our heads.
Once upon a time, &amp;ldquo;the United States of America&amp;rdquo; was a plural noun. (I&amp;rsquo;ll prove it to you in a moment.) Careful writers and speakers would say &amp;ldquo;the United States are .

Trump&amp;rsquo;s influence on American culture can already be seen in marriage and divorce rates. According to Bloomberg, divorce is down to 35-year lows and marriage rates began pumping up during the recent campaign.

                Guest Post by Lee A. Presser
My friend Bill Hennessy wrote an excellent 11-12-16 blog analysis of Anglo-American history and how it relates to Mr. Trump’s victory (https://hennessysview.com/2016/11/12/how-the-second-born-twin-can-be-older-than-the-first/). After reading that blog I phoned him to add a tangential thought. Bill suggested I share the thought with you.
It took 561 years (from the Magna Carta to the Declaration of Independence) for the idea of limited government and political equality to infuse itself into Anglo-American culture.

                Trump&amp;rsquo;s win is far bigger than the vote. As British General Cornwallis said at the end of the movie &amp;lsquo;The Patriot,&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Everything will change . . . everything has changed.&amp;rdquo;
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about policy, you&amp;rsquo;re thinking really, really small. Trump&amp;rsquo;s influence is way bigger. Here are three ways Trump will change America for a generation.

                Have you ever noticed that twins have a pecking order? Even identical twins born minutes apart show a subtle seniority complex. Usually the first-born twin leads the second-born.
Makes you wonder how these Peterson twins will relate to each other, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?
Because of the time change at the end of daylight saving time, the second-born twin is officially older than the first. That&amp;rsquo;ll be interesting to watch. And if you find yourself pondering the oddness of those twins&amp;rsquo; birth order, you can easily find yourself pondering America&amp;rsquo;s little sister relationship to the UK.

                Adam Carolla noticed something I didn&amp;rsquo;t.
Carolla&amp;rsquo;s first reaction to the election results was this. Hillary Clinton built herself a Logan&amp;rsquo;s Run type palace for her would-be coronation. Donald Trump accepted the presidency in a room that might double as a Hometown Buffet.
Put another way, here&amp;rsquo;s what the winner&amp;rsquo;s auditorium:

                Sometimes I forget what originally drove me to call for a tea party protest in St. Louis.
One motivation was fear of missing out because a dozen other cities were planning protests. Another driver was a desire change the direction of the country. And at least some of it was the frustrated actor in me looking for an outlet.
Since two-thirds of those motivations appeal only to me, let’s focus on the middle one: change the country.

My answer: blank slate.
I have no expectations. None. I have preferences, but no expectations.
It&amp;rsquo;s kind of silly to expect something you have little or no control over. I have no control over James Comey or Loretta Lynch, much less the millions of American and non-Americans who will vote.

It&amp;rsquo;s easy to panic or get mad or dejected. Totally understandable. But that&amp;rsquo;s totally counterproductive, too. And being mad or acting dispirited is just what the elites want us to do.

                Yesterday I speculated that Barack Obama had grown sick of Hillary&amp;rsquo;s corruption, lies, and criminal disregard for the rule of law.
A lot of people thought I was nuts, that I was reading too much into the White House statement that discredited Hillary&amp;rsquo;s primary talking point about James Comey.
But today the Gateway Pundit reports that Michelle Obama has scrubbed all references** to Hillary Clinton from both of her Twitter timelines**.

                Since its revelation in WikiLeaks two weeks ago, Donna Brazile has been justly excoriated for cheating on behalf of Hillary Clinton by passing along a debate question.
However, an important aspect to this story has been overlooked. As the saying goes, it takes two to tango. Yes, Donna Brazile sent a critically beneficial piece of information - but Hillary Clinton accepted it.
Mrs. Clinton accepted it (stealing), used it (cheating), and said nothing (lying).

The same thing can happen in political &amp;ldquo;marriages.&amp;rdquo; That surface quality that attracted you—donors, influence, contacts, whatever—sometimes isn&amp;rsquo;t worth the price.

From Bill Richardson to Robby Mook, Clinton surrogates are reciting a strange and disturbing talking point: Voters have &amp;ldquo;baked in&amp;rdquo; Clinton&amp;rsquo;s life of crime.
[FLASHBACK: I gave James Comey the benefit of the doubt in July]
The talking point seems meant to keep Democrats from panicking over the FBI&amp;rsquo;s re-opened criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.

                As I pointed out last Saturday, a tiny faction of Missouri conservatives prefers Missouri&amp;rsquo;s pathetic status quo to true leadership and positive change. Those people apparently approve of Missouri&amp;rsquo;s horrible economy, weak schools, and declining stature in the country. And nowhere does Missouri&amp;rsquo;s decline stand out like San Diego, California.
Last week, I spent a few days bumming around San Diego with my son. He is stationed there in the US Navy.

Suppose you read that a scientific study proved dark blue socks look best with a gray suit. Then someone known for his remarkable sense of style shows up wearing purple striped socks with a gray suit. What would you do?
Before you answer that, consider this.
You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard that a handful of conservative activists are supporting the Democrat running for governor. Those misguided conservatives think the GOP nominee isn&amp;rsquo;t conservative enough.

Every election since 1960 has involved massive election rigging by Democrats. They laugh about it privately and act all offended by the accusation in public.
Republicans let it happen. Republicans like John McCain believe they have a &amp;ldquo;duty&amp;rdquo; to concede even if an election is rigged. They called &amp;ldquo;honorable.&amp;rdquo; But conceding a rigged election is actually a moral failing.

NeverTrumpers seem to believe that the act of voting is a sort of magic spell that can right all past wrongs. Psychologists call this &amp;ldquo;magical thinking.&amp;rdquo; Children do it. Magical thinking is the belief that we can change the outside world with our thoughts. Think of rain dances and crossed fingers. Or, as Dr. Ben Hunt explains, Fed policy.

If you answered &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to any of these questions, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably met Hillary Clinton. Hillary is likely a psychopath according to official FBI documents released Friday.
What is psychopathy? For the answer, let&amp;rsquo;s go to the book Almost a Psychopath (h/t Eric Barker):
 Psychopathy is a psychological condition in which the individual shows a profound lack of empathy for the feelings of others, a willingness to engage in immoral and antisocial behavior for short-term gains, and extreme egocentricity.

                Lying is tough business.
People believe lies with more details. Time, date, people, exact words, what people were wearing, sequences of events. All that. So liars usually provide some gripping details to make their lies more believable.
In casual conversation, this works. Once some sucker buys your lie, you&amp;rsquo;re pretty much in the clear. The problem comes when you broadcast your lie for maximum coverage. The more people who hear the lie, the more people try to verify those details.

                People in the media and the GOP are acting like they learned something on Friday. That&amp;rsquo;s when the Washington Post released an audio (later conjoined with video) of Donald Trump talking lewd about his exploits with women.
I say media people and Republicans are &amp;ldquo;acting&amp;rdquo; like they learned something, because they didn&amp;rsquo;t. We didn&amp;rsquo;t. Everybody who&amp;rsquo;s paid attention to the race (or pop culture) already knew how Trump is. Everybody knows Trump brags about his sexual prowess and how women melt around him.

                Today, Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) abandoned her party&amp;rsquo;s nominee to support a rape accomplice for President. Ann Wagner has lost her moral authority on all matters outside of her own home. I call on Mrs. Wagner to resign from the House of Representatives and to retire gracefully from public life.
Mrs. Wagner seems to believe that being a woman gives her some unique moral vantage point. She forgets that she&amp;rsquo;s not the only woman in America.

Maybe, but not likely. It&amp;rsquo;s more likely that the story dropped to cover up the latest Hillary email scandal. Gwen Ifill agrees (via Breitbart):
 we would have been paying attention a lot more tonight to some revelations from WikiLeaks about Hillary Clinton’s email — her latest email tranche from the State Department.

Well, Lester Holt gave it a try.
I want the statements back.
Last night, the debate began with a question and ended with an answer. No opening or closing. Without those framing statements, the whole thing felt like middle music—a name my colleague gave to the music in upscale hotel lobbies that just goes on and on.

The clearest example was on Lester Holt&amp;rsquo;s question on cyber security. Hillary went first and gave a long, robotic answer, hitting all the buzzwords her handlers made her memorize.
Trump countered with a similar answer. But Trump could have crippled Hillary with a single line:

As you ponder Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s fall from grace (even David Axelrod is trashing her now), you might remember Jimmy Carter&amp;rsquo;s collapse.
I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about his collapse on election night. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about one of the two incidents that psychologically destroyed Carter&amp;rsquo;s image as a leader. In a moment, I&amp;rsquo;ll remind you of the collapse.

  While most serious people dismissed the rumors about Clinton’s health that were being circulated by Donald Trump’s supporters, what happened Sunday morning will deepen suspicions both about her health and whether her campaign has been telling the truth about it.

                You might find yourself freaking out that NRA endorsed the Democrat for Missouri Governor instead of Republican Eric Greitens. If you think about it, though, the endorsement makes perfect sense from the NRA&amp;rsquo;s perspective.
You realize that the NRA is a lobbying firm, and lobbyists have an easier time working with an established asset like Koster than cultivating an outsider like Greitens. Recruiting and cultivating an asset is to a lobbyist as finding and selling a new customer is to a business.

Before Trump even woke up this morning, the Washington Post declared the future meeting a complete disaster that Trump will never recover from. The Post predicted a complete visual and verbal disaster even though there&amp;rsquo;s no historical evidence on which to base such a prediction.

 Disenchanted, but not apathetic. Caring about issues, although much more concerned about character.

It&amp;rsquo;s not, &amp;ldquo;act like a Republican and lose.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;pivot,&amp;rdquo; a word I detest. “Honey badger don’t give a s&amp;mdash;” is the Breitbart motto, and &amp;ldquo;the most dangerous political operative in America&amp;rdquo; is now running Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign.

The entire political world is reeling today with news that Donald Trump has named the incredible Stephen K.

                The Gateway Pundit, Jim Hoft, was pro-Trump long before I was. Like me, he&amp;rsquo;s fed up with the politically correct elites who profit while America burns. And Jim recognized long before I did that Donald Trump is the voice for American greatness, for the dignity of meaningful work, for the security of strong borders.
Jim Hoft will be among the featured speakers at the St. Louis area Tea Party for Trump on August 28, 2016 at Surdyke Harley-Davidson in Festus.

America’s fiscal year is October 1 to September 30. With two month left in FY16, the U.S. Treasury has already paid creditors $380,925,428,211.67 in interest costs. (That’s $381 Billion) https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm
The average interest rate was just over 2%. https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/pd/avg/2016/2016_07.htm
 It is expected that the last two month’s of this fiscal year, interest costs will increase another $45 to $66 Billion. The total FY16 interest cost may be between $426 and $447 Billion.

                France’s population had changed considerably since 1614. The non-aristocratic members of the Third Estate now represented 98 percent of the people but could still be outvoted by the other two bodies. In the lead-up to the May 5 meeting, the Third Estate began to mobilize support for equal representation and the abolishment of the noble veto–in other words, they wanted voting by head and not by status. While all of the orders shared a common desire for fiscal and judicial reform as well as a more representative form of government, the nobles in particular were loath to give up the privileges they enjoyed under the traditional system.

                You might be wondering why the Missouri Farm Bureau endorsed Democrat Chris Koster instead of Republican Eric Greitens. The Farm Bureau endorses Republicans about 99% of the time.
If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking it had to do with policy or personality, you&amp;rsquo;re thinking wrong. (And, no, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t because of Koster&amp;rsquo;s hair, Mark Reardon.) This was all about the establishment vs. the people. It&amp;rsquo;s about power and control. Greitens threatens the establishment.

                Why did Trump beat Ted Cruz? Probably the biggest reason is that Trump talks purpose while Cruz talks policy and principles.
When people hear Trump, they hear a purpose that aligns with their purpose. I know I do. And it&amp;rsquo;s similar to the purpose Arthur C. Brooks explained in his great book, The Conservative Heart.
Ted Cruz never seemed to have a purpose, just policies and principles. Cruz spoke of abstract principles and left it to the people to figure out if those principles would make their lives better or worse.

                Navy SEAL Eric Greitens won the first political race of his life. Few first timers win a major party&amp;rsquo;s nomination for governor of a state. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably hear just how rare Greitens&amp;rsquo;s feat was. But not tonight. I want to tell some stories.
Eric Greitens gave up a morning of this campaign to talk to one of my kids. That kid is a man now. He&amp;rsquo;s in the Navy at a helo combat squadron in San Diego.

If you&amp;rsquo;re a Republican and you follow the advice of the Democratic Governors Association, you won&amp;rsquo;t vote for Eric Greitens. The DGA wants Democrat Chris Koster to win, so Democrats are telling Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Republicans not to nominate Greitens. Democrats believe Greitens beats Koster in November.

 Things just got weirder in Missouri. After the stunning revelation that people associated with John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s campaign did, in fact, produce a false, negative video attacking Eric Greitens, you might be wondering what&amp;rsquo;s going on?

                Contrasts.
Two Politico stories, just weeks apart, demonstrate the remarkable contrasts between the two candidates for president.
The headline of the Trump story tells it all:
 Trump raised $32 million with RNC, but kept only a fraction.
 And the Hillary story:
 Leaked emails show officials tried to obscure the fact that Clinton allowed states to keep only a tiny fraction of proceeds from joint fundraising.
 Trump is on Team America.

Donald Trump is the anti-myth, the truth-teller, the blunt reporter of reality on reality&amp;rsquo;s terms. And his speech, his reality manifesto, stole the hearts of thevast majority of Americas.
So many myths dispelled.

The Pledge thing is a goodly part of it.
Simply put, the parties to the Pledge Ted Cruz signed were only Ted Cruz and the RNC (by extension, you can probably include the delegates and voters, too).
The Pledge promised support, including data, from the RNC in exchange for Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s endorsement of the eventual nominee.

Today Cruz proved himself to be Lyin&amp;rsquo; Ted again.
After swearing that his non-endorsement was all about &amp;ldquo;freedom and the Constitution,&amp;rdquo; he admitted today that he broke his oath of support solely because Trump insulted his wife and his father. For Ted, this was personal, not business.
Ted could have told us it was personal last night. But he lied instead. He could have said something else, too.

                You&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking that Ted Cruz made Donald Trump look bad last night. And he did. Ted Cruz had a prime time speaking slot and he failed to endorse his party&amp;rsquo;s nominee for president. Hillary Clinton will use it.
A lot of people are saying Trump shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have invited him to speak unless Cruz agreed to endorse Trump. But Trump didn&amp;rsquo;t even ask for Cruz&amp;rsquo;s endorsement. Trump just offered Ted the prime time spot, and Ted took it.

In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t hear, Donald Trump waived his right to review Senator Cruz&amp;rsquo;s speech in advance, the first time that&amp;rsquo;s happened in our lifetimes according to Tucker Carlson. Mr. Trump respects Senator Cruz enough to let the senator say whatever he wants.

They make this claim knowing full well that Trump is ahead of Romney in every poll and with every demographic group.

Now, in this foul year of our Lord twenty-sixteen, just over 300,000 people call the city home. A 70 percent decline!
And I&amp;rsquo;m not one of them. For several reasons that no reasonable person could argue with.

                When a person declares himself &amp;ldquo;NeverTrump,&amp;rdquo; he thinks he&amp;rsquo;s making a political statement. Or a moral one. But he&amp;rsquo;s not. He&amp;rsquo;s making a psychological commitment that&amp;rsquo;s very difficult and painful to break.
Identity is the highest, most powerful form of persuasion. Identity also drives our decisions in parts of the brain we don&amp;rsquo;t really have conscious control over. I realize many conservatives reject brain science, but, for those of you who are open to learning, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain as best I can in a moment.

Now we know: to be anti-Trump is to be pro-abortion and pro-race war. To be anti-Trump is to support violence against police officers, especially white police officers. That&amp;rsquo;s because Hillary is all those things, and to be anti-Trump is, logically, to be pro-Hillary. (If they both live until January 20, either Clinton or Trump will be the next president.

You, like me, probably know you&amp;rsquo;re not responsible for what anyone else does, and other people&amp;rsquo;s behavior doesn&amp;rsquo;t excuse your behavior. You agree with that, don&amp;rsquo;t you?

Let&amp;rsquo;s play the imagine game. Imagine Comey decided to refer Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s crimes to the Department of Justice for prosecution. What would happen?

                A lot of people seem to be mad at Trump. You might be one of them.
You probably think you know why you’re mad at him. For instance, you might not like what he said about the judge in a lawsuit he’s involved with. Or maybe you didn’t like what he said about Rosie O’Donnell. You might even be mad that he said Saddam Hussein was a bad man who was good at killing terrorists.

A lot of people who grew up with dogs suffered emotional trauma when something bad happened to their dog. Imagine how you&amp;rsquo;d feel if you were seven or eight and you left the gate open and the dog got out and got hit by a car.

                When the BBC called Brexit for LEAVE at about 12:30 a.m. CDT today, I thought first of my friend Mike Flynn. Mike had a keen sense of history. He put the Tea Party movement into proper perspective, as he did with all events. Mike kept us from overstating both the Tea Party&amp;rsquo;s effect and its potential. Or he put them in context and reminded us that our potential depends on ourselves, not outside forces.

                As an American, I am proud of the people from whose loins our nation sprang. United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union. The Brits rejected globalist, elitist threats and insults to vote for independence. Like America did in 1776.
Savor this moment in history. You were alive to see a nation reject foreign tyranny. Every Brit who voted LEAVE showed courage and love of freedom. God bless them all.

                Some people say they&amp;rsquo;re afraid of Donald Trump for bizarre reasons. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard he&amp;rsquo;s a dictator, a fascist, a genocidal maniac, and a lousy businessman. If any of that is true, there&amp;rsquo;s no evidence of it, so he must also own all the media already. And the internet. In fact, if Trump is a lousy businessman who managed to bungle his way to a $10 billion fortune, he must really bad at dictatoring, because he hasn&amp;rsquo;t even conquered his home country in 70 years.

There are about 320 million people in the United States. About one percent are Muslims. By comparison, about 2.5 percent of Americans are Jewish. It&amp;rsquo;s safe to say, then, that there are about 2.

See, Lyndon Johnson was a Democrat, and he proposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Most Democrats violently opposed the bill. But most Republicans supported it. The bill passed, of course, and it survived many Supreme Court challenges.
The Civil Rights Act&amp;rsquo;s aim was to wring racist behavior out of American life.

The answer to my opening question is &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo; Many judges have presided unfairly over trials. For example, many blacks were sent to prison when the same evidence would have exonerated a white defendant. We all know that.

                The god of Memorial Day is Janus, looking to the future as well as the past.
Memorial Day looks back, but it also warns of something coming. The list of war dead is incomplete. It always will be.
Each generation looks at its wars and finds something final, but the end never comes. Memorials never end while man roams the earth.
When I see the Vietnam Memorial, with its rows and ranks of lost warriors, I see, too, the invisible ledger that stretches to the horizon.

Trump vs. Sanders would be the most watched political event ever.

                Donald Trump just exploded the heads of professional talkers on CNN. It was honestly funny.
Trump reached 1,237 delegates today, clinching the nomination of the Republican Party. He will be the 45th President of the United States, and his press conferences will be the most popular show on television. It will be huge, believe me. And after the press conference, Trump did something that might have sealed the deal with American voters.

                After the 1998 Rams season, I walked into City Limits bar or Brothers bar or whatever its name was then. It&amp;rsquo;s a strip mall bar in Wildwood. Cindy Schuenke was tending bar, and we started talking about the Rams&amp;rsquo; dismal season. She said they were hopeless, but I disagreed. &amp;ldquo;They are four players away,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;A quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a defensive end.&amp;rdquo;
Later in the year, but before the season, the Rams acquired Trent Green (and Kurt Warner) at QB, Marshall Faulk at RB, Adam Timmermann at offensive guard, and Grant Wistrom moved up to start at defensive end.

People write &amp;ldquo;President Trump&amp;rdquo; three times as much as they write &amp;ldquo;President Clinton.&amp;rdquo; For every one person who writes &amp;ldquo;President Trump&amp;rdquo; in a column, blog, tweet, or Facebook post, hundreds of thousands more say or think &amp;ldquo;President Trump&amp;rdquo; every day.
That&amp;rsquo;s how I predicted Trump winning by a landslide. I watched what people say and do.

                Say what you want about Donald Trump, the customer service at his properties is insanely great. And The Donald personally sets the standard for that service. He also inspects it, and he has a sick level of attention to detail. Donald Trump doesn&amp;rsquo;t miss a thing when it comes to providing a perfect environment for his guests and residents.
The opposite is true of the TSA. Like most government-run operations, the TSA sucks at customer service.

Lately, though, most of that &amp;ldquo;principles&amp;rdquo; talk is about how Donald Trump has caused good conservatives to abandon their principles.
Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s true. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to believe it.
The one principle that many conservatives have abandoned and encouraged others to abandon: keeping your word.
The lead advocate for abandoning this principle of keeping one&amp;rsquo;s word is Jonah Goldberg of National Review and the American Enterprise Institute.

                You might have noticed that my predictions have been remarkably accurate lately, have you not?
For example, on Sunday, May 1, I predicted Ted Cruz would suspend his campaign after getting trounced in Indiana. Two days later, Cruz lost the Indiana primary to Donald Trump 53 to 36. At the time I wrote, many pundits and pollster still believed Cruz could win that Indiana race, and everyone believed Cruz was telling the truth when he said repeatedly he was staying in the race to Cleveland unless Trump reached 1,237 delegates before then.

House Speaker Paul Ryan has set aside Thursday for meetings with his party&amp;rsquo;s nominee for President. Every nominee for president meets with the senior members of his party&amp;rsquo;s Congressional caucus, so there&amp;rsquo;s nothing odd about the meeting.

Contrasts and comparisons.

World leaders expect Trump to win, and they are lining up to make all his crazy assertions look like brilliant predictions.
Former Mexico president Vicente Fox apologized to Trump, and Trump graciously accepted. That&amp;rsquo;s a sign that Mexicans expect Trump to become the next US president.

                Let&amp;rsquo;s regress in time to the 1980s.
Remember C. Everett Koop, the Surgeon-General who launched the Safe Sex movement? Koop wanted to curtail the spread of AIDS. The Safe Sex movement started slowly and originally focused on non-monogamous gay men. By 1987, though, everyone was doing it. (Or not doing &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; as the case may be.) A February 17, 1987 New York Times headline declared &amp;ldquo;Safe Sex Movement Gains Favor Among Heterosexuals.

Your work is done, now, so you sit in your favorite outdoor chair and take in the relaxing, comfortable view. Smell the freshness of spring wildflowers.

Folks, this is the war we&amp;rsquo;re fighting. It&amp;rsquo;s the war that pits innovation against entrenched incumbents. It&amp;rsquo;s the too small to survive against too big to fail. And it&amp;rsquo;s the reason we call ourselves conservatives.

In 2012, I pretended I believed Mitt Romney would win. But I knew better. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the heart to tell the truth to the volunteers banging doors and working call lists from our election office in South County.
But I knew Romney would lose. I suspected the GOP would not regain the Senate.
When some of our hardest workers showed up to help break down the office and move our belongings, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t look at them.

                That was a strategic kill-shot, to borrow Scott Adams&amp;rsquo;s word. And it changes everything for conservatives.
After a so-so debate performance and in the middle of a 16-hour verbal assault from Marco Rubio, Trump went nuclear. But not the way everyone would expect Trump to go nuclear.
Trump didn&amp;rsquo;t need to invent a brilliant new put-down line to counter Marco. Instead, he calmly introduced Chris Christie to 10,000 fans in Texas.

Glenn Beck, Erick Erickson, and other Republicans have convinced a lot of people that we are doomed if Donald Trump wins the Republican nomination. I know some people who are nearly incapacitated with fear and grief after last night&amp;rsquo;s Nevada caucuses. Because they listen to Glenn Beck. Sad!

Glenn Beck&amp;rsquo;s theology is very different from mine.
In 2010, I worried that Glenn Beck was doing more harm than good. For days, I&amp;rsquo;d watched Beck tell his watchers that the world was ending and they would be crushed. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I wrote:
 Beck offers no solutions. At least, he hasn’t in the past two days.

 Cleaning up the practice of Jefferson City’s revolving door is the reason for Rep. Caleb Rowden’s House Bill 1979 (carried in the Senate by Sen. Bob Onder). It puts in place a one year cooling off period that will make legislators sit out for at least a year before lobbying.

                Ted Cruz has a powerful strategy available to him. This strategy could not only determine the winner of the Republican convention but put Cruz in position to influence policy for generations.
But it&amp;rsquo;s probably not what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to lay out some assumptions, many of which you could disagree with. That&amp;rsquo;s okay. But for the purposes of this post, let&amp;rsquo;s stipulate:
*1. Ted Cruz believes, like Glenn Beck, that Donald Trump would make a worse president than Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, or Bernie Sanders.

This back door would allow the FBI to access the content of the San Bernardino terrorists’ phone, possibly exposing more terrorists. That would be a good thing.
But Apple never built a back door to the iPhone because no one can control the keys to such portals. If Apple builds it, every government spy agency in the world will be able to read your texts, see where you’ve been, and listen to your phone calls.

Surface thinkers ignored most of the content. I warned you about this early on. I decided against a deep examination of conservatism because people don&amp;rsquo;t care. Instead, I wrote a rather tongue-in-cheek story about why definitions of conservatism don&amp;rsquo;t matter.
Deep thinkers got the tongue-in-cheek shtick. Maybe they rolled their eyes at my cheap attempt at being clever.

Figuring out whether Greitens is a conservative or not requires a lot of thinking, a lot of writing, and a lot of clear analysis from readers. I won&amp;rsquo;t waste time on the first two because I won&amp;rsquo;t get the last no matter what.

The American people get to decide who moves into the United States. If immigrants are coming for a free meal, we don’t need them. If immigrants are coming for free healthcare, we don’t need them. If immigrants are coming for free housing, we don’t need them. If immigrants are coming and their presence in the United States increases the public debt, we definitely don’t need them.
If immigrants come here to improve their lives and the lives of their family members WITHOUT becoming a burden on American society, we will seriously consider their application.

                I re-read Ronald Reagan&amp;rsquo;s announcement speech the other day.
Delivered November 13, 1979, these are the words that launched the greatest presidency of my lifetime.
Notice the natural humanity in Reagan&amp;rsquo;s words. He didn&amp;rsquo;t browbeat people with abstract concepts like the Constitution or liberty. Instead, he spoke about the real lives of ordinary Americans. And the everyday life of an America that lived up to its ideal. And notice the complete lack of pomposity, vanity, and vulgarity so prevalent in the frontrunners of 2016.

Nothing distinguishes me from Protestants more profoundly than that concept: the magisterium, or the teaching authority, of the church.

Those philosophical and political founders interpreted and organized ancient philosophy for England and America.

It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to go Machiavellian during primaries. Even during general elections after primaries. But there&amp;rsquo;s a great danger for the grassroots.
**If we don&amp;rsquo;t hold candidates accountable during the race when we have all the leverage, how can we possibly hold office-holders accountable? **

But it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. Instead, Trump managed to show humility and graciousness without giving up his signature bravado. Pretty brilliant. As Romney and Rove learned in 2012, though, air power will not win many races.

                This &amp;ldquo;VOTING VIOLATION&amp;rdquo; controversy says bad things about the Cruz campaign.
(BTW, Rubio&amp;rsquo;s campaign sent a similar, but less creepy, mailer, too. So far, I have not seen a large number of complaints about the Rubio mailer.)
And I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the ethics of publicly shaming people who vote sporadically. I&amp;rsquo;m talking two gross electioneering violations from a campaign that markets itself as the most scientifically advanced in history. With the mailer Team Cruz showed a lack of strategic understanding of the science and compounded their ignorance by apparently making up numbers.

After reading some of National Review&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Against Trump&amp;rdquo; issue,I wrote blog post. To me the NR issue showed the magazine is out of touch with voters. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about traditional, reliable, motivated, and informed primary voters.** I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the broader pool of voters who vote in general elections every four, eight, or twelve years** and occasionally in local elections.

It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand how late-deciders tend to vote. This knowledge (especially in Iowa and New Hampshire) could decide the outcome.
Primary voters tend to decide whom to for at the last minute.
In 2008, 16 percent of voters said they made their choice on election day. Which means we have a long way to go to know how Iowa will turn out.

Psychologists and sociologists attributed the genre&amp;rsquo;s popularity to the people&amp;rsquo;s need to assimilate nuclear holocaust.

                On New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve, male Muslim refugees rampaged across Europe.
They didn&amp;rsquo;t use guns and bombs. They used their bodies. On women.
This created a political-correctness nightmare for Europe&amp;rsquo;s leaders. On the one hand, the victims were women, and no means no, and we must always believe a woman who accuses a man of sexual predation (unless the man is Bill Clinton in which case we destroy the woman).
On the other hand, the assailants .

                THE SECOND COMING --William Butler Yeats Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity. Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand.

                You have another chance to improve government and fight petty tyranny by supporting Senator Eric Schmitt&amp;rsquo;s latest bill to hold local government accountable.
Last year, Senator Schmitt became the champion of responsible local government with SB-5, a bill designed to end &amp;ldquo;taxation by citation&amp;rdquo; in local governments.
This year, Senator Schmitt is back to close a loophole that some cities are exploiting to suck more money out of residents who can least afford it.

                I figured it out about the same time Ben Hochman of the Post Dispatch did: Stan Kroenke wrote a letter designed to force the owners to move the Rams to Los Angeles right now.
The acrimony created by Kroenke&amp;rsquo;s relocation request letter makes the situation in St. Louis untenable for the team and its owner. In short, Kroenke calls St. Louis a second-rate, economically depressed, crime-infest toilet of a city full of people so obsessed with baseball that no other sports franchise has the ability to compete for entertainment dollars.

                Last year about this time, Business Insider asked 13 Wall Street analysts where the S&amp;amp;P 500 would stand at close of trading today.
For background, the S&amp;amp;P 500 began the year at 2058.9. The mean guess for closing number was 2212 with a standard deviation of 83.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the ugly chart: Three of the guesses&amp;ndash;Oppenheimer, RBC, and Fundstrat&amp;ndash;were more than 3 standard deviations from the actual close of 2050.
Fundstrat&amp;rsquo;s Tom Lee, the most overzealous guesser, expected capex to drive the S&amp;amp;P 500 t0 a whopping 2325.
