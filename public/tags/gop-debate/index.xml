      <description>I like to say I hate electoral politics.
Maybe I just want people to think I&amp;rsquo;m the kind of person who hates electoral politics. (We are all capable of being wrong about ourselves.)
I have to say, briefly, that this was the most encouraging Republican debate since . . . 1980? These are all serious people, and I&amp;rsquo;m including Trump. They all love America, and not just what they might get from America.</description>
