      <description>A recurring theme in the Old Testament went something like this: the people of God (Jews) face a temporal crisis. The people of God surrender to a pagan nation, paying tribute to both the foreigners and to their gods.
Most of the chosen people assimilate with their earthly masters. During the Babylonian Exile, they largely abandoned circumcision and most of the Mosaic laws. The Temple was given over to orgies and terrible sacrilege.</description>

      <description>Thank you to everyone who replied to the 2020 Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View (totally self-serving) Survey. Here are the results:
New Blog Design On a scale of 1 to 10, readers give the new design a score of 8.95. I&amp;rsquo;ll round that up to 9.0. Thank you!
What Topics Do You Want to See Covered? Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t ask permission to post your responses to these questions, I&amp;rsquo;m going to summarize. I list these topics in the form of questions that I can answer later with posts.</description>
