      <description>Can you guess Stephen K. Bannon&amp;rsquo;s mantra at Breitbart? It&amp;rsquo;s not, &amp;ldquo;act like a Republican and lose.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;pivot,&amp;rdquo; a word I detest. “Honey badger don’t give a s&amp;mdash;” is the Breitbart motto, and &amp;ldquo;the most dangerous political operative in America&amp;rdquo; is now running Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign.

      <description>The Gateway Pundit, Jim Hoft, was pro-Trump long before I was. Like me, he&amp;rsquo;s fed up with the politically correct elites who profit while America burns. And Jim recognized long before I did that Donald Trump is the voice for American greatness, for the dignity of meaningful work, for the security of strong borders.
Jim Hoft will be among the featured speakers at the St. Louis area Tea Party for Trump on August 28, 2016 at Surdyke Harley-Davidson in Festus.</description>
