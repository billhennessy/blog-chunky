      <description>Okay, let me explain this in the simplest possible way&amp;hellip;
 you&amp;hellip;are&amp;hellip;an&amp;hellip;idiot.
&amp;ndash;Scott Adams, Dilbert
 Lately&amp;hellip;the Peter Principle has given way to the &amp;ldquo;Dilbert Principle.&amp;rdquo; The basic concept of the Dilbert Principle is that the most ineffective workers are systematically moved to the place where they can do the least damage: management.

      <description>They. Don&amp;rsquo;t. Care.
The conservative war against Trump won&amp;rsquo;t work.
I get why National Review and The Weekly Standard devote whole issues of magazines to Trump&amp;rsquo;s lack of conservative bonafides. I appreciate it. Their work is important. **But their tactic will prove completely useless in defeating Trump. **In fact, the fight is already over, and the cover story proves it.
Conservative magazines&amp;ndash;online or on paper&amp;ndash;are supposed to weigh events and people against conservative principles and pass judgment.</description>
