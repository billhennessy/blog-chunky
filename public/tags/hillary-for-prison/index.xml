      <description>You might have dated someone who was amazingly good looking. Everything&amp;rsquo;s great. For awhile. Then you get to know the person. A little too well. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s on a weekend trip. Or, God forbid, when you move in together. Then you realize looks aren&amp;rsquo;t everything.
The same thing can happen in political &amp;ldquo;marriages.&amp;rdquo; That surface quality that attracted you—donors, influence, contacts, whatever—sometimes isn&amp;rsquo;t worth the price.
Just ask Barack Obama.</description>
