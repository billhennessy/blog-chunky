      <description>Without power, principles are platitudes.
Consider this a favor to the Freedom Caucusers. Those folks can&amp;rsquo;t see past the end of their own principles.
Knowing the Freedom Caucus people pretty well, I know they&amp;rsquo;re very happy with Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. I know they&amp;rsquo;d be very miserable if Gorsuch were rejected and Trump had to nominate someone who could win a few Democrat votes.
It&amp;rsquo;s all about power.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I placed blame for the healthcare debacle at Speaker Ryan&amp;rsquo;s feet. I also wrote that I expected the Republican establishment to blame the tea party. To blame us for aborting the Trump presidency in his first 100 days.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to beat the establishment to that punch a little. Because the Freedom Caucus and some of my favorite action organizations looked a little juvenile in this debate. Juvenile and stupid.</description>
