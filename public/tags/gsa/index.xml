      <description>There are two kinds of people in America: those who grow up to become productive adults, and those who become bureaucrats.
The GSA scandal lit up the 3 Stooges mentality of the &amp;ldquo;men and women&amp;rdquo; who would run every aspect of your life if Obama and his czars get their way.

Jeff Neely&amp;rsquo;s the guy Thomas Jefferson had in mind when wrote:
 He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.</description>

      <description>Let me get this straight. Secret Service Agents and some military guys brought more than 20 &amp;ndash; count &amp;lsquo;em, _twenty _&amp;ndash; hookers to a hotel in Cartagena, Columbia. The Americans were drinking&amp;ndash;a lot, according to hotel staff. When the girls were ready to leave, apparently, the Americans refused to pay.
I guess these soldier or sailors or Marines don&amp;rsquo;t watch enough movies. They&amp;rsquo;d know how hookers act when they don&amp;rsquo;t get paid.</description>
