      <description>For the past seventeen months, Alex Rife has covered the conservative movement with the highest quality video available. His work even got me on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.
For Alex to continue his video apostolate, he needs our help.
I just joined his network for $5 a month. I hope you will, too. Today.
Alex has invested thousands of dollars and thousands of hours of his time in our mission.</description>
