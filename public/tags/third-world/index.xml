      <description>For years voters have complained that politicians and parties say anything to get a vote. People have longed for the days of plain talk and honesty.

  The Democrats rejected any reference to God.
  The Democrats rejected Jerusalem as Israel&amp;rsquo;s capital.
  The question is: can you trust them? Do Democrats really reject God and reject Jerusalem as the center of Israeli political life?</description>
