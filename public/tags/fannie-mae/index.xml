      <description>The current economic mess is a gift of the DNC. Massechusetts Congressman Barney Frank (D) bears the lion&amp;rsquo;s share of guilt. Charles Schumer (D-NY), Maxine Waters (D-CA), and William Clay (D-MO) rank near the top of the list.

Just another sign that democracy in America is over. In November, Change.gov banned conservatives from asking questions or offering suggestions to Barack Obama.
