      <description>Yesterday I speculated that Barack Obama had grown sick of Hillary&amp;rsquo;s corruption, lies, and criminal disregard for the rule of law.
A lot of people thought I was nuts, that I was reading too much into the White House statement that discredited Hillary&amp;rsquo;s primary talking point about James Comey.
But today the Gateway Pundit reports that Michelle Obama has scrubbed all references** to Hillary Clinton from both of her Twitter timelines**.</description>

      <description>When did first ladies become dictators?
Seriously. The president&amp;rsquo;s family has no more authority than anyone else. The reason people show contempt for activist spouses of presidents is the same reason history hates Marie Antoinette.
I know, the all-Democrat Congress passed the school nutrition law in 2010, but Michelle Obama wrote it.
Michelle Obama has dictated that no tasty foods may enter any school property. That ban includes school bake sales and snack shops which has PTOs scrambling to replace lost income.</description>

      <description>Think of a four letter word to describe Michelle Obama, who has loathed America her entire life. Black Five nails it.
