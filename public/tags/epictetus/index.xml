      <description>&amp;ldquo;Some things we can control, some we can’t. We can control our attitudes, opinions, goals and desires – choices of our own. We can’t control health, wealth, fame or power – things we can’t have by choosing them.&amp;rdquo; —Epictetus
 Freedom begins with understanding what we control and we do not. Yet very few people even begin to consider this essential dichotomy.
Even in the complete absence of &amp;ldquo;administration&amp;rdquo; as Tocqueville observed in early 19th century America, no one was free who failed to understand Epictetus&amp;rsquo;s control dichotomy: some things are under our control, some are not.</description>
