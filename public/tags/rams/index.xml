      <description>You thought Stan Kroenke wanted a team in Los Angeles? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. I think Stan is playing a long con. And I think it&amp;rsquo;s a brilliant strategy.
Los Angeles is a terrible market for football teams, but it&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic market for the NFL. It would be a perfect place to build a permanent home for the Super Bowl. Los Angeles has fantastic weather, great attractions, and a huge pool of football fans, fans of every team in the NFL.</description>

      <title>Kroenke&#39;s Brilliant Move</title>

      <description>I figured it out about the same time Ben Hochman of the Post Dispatch did: Stan Kroenke wrote a letter designed to force the owners to move the Rams to Los Angeles right now.
The acrimony created by Kroenke&amp;rsquo;s relocation request letter makes the situation in St. Louis untenable for the team and its owner. In short, Kroenke calls St. Louis a second-rate, economically depressed, crime-infest toilet of a city full of people so obsessed with baseball that no other sports franchise has the ability to compete for entertainment dollars.</description>
