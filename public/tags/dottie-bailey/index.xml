      <description>The one who has the bride is the bridegroom; the best man, who stands and listens for him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom’s voice. So this joy of mine has been made complete. (Johhn 3:29)
 Yesterday, January 9, 2019, was a watershed day for everyone who ever associated with the St. Louis Tea Party Coalition. Your own Dottie Bailey was sworn in as Representative of the 110th State House district of Eureka, Wildwood, and Pacific.</description>

      <description>How will God answer our prayers to make America holy again?
For 17 days we&amp;rsquo;ve been praying, going to confession, going to mass as often as we can. Rosaries. Chaplet of St. Michael. Tomorrow, election day, our back-to-back novenas wrap up.
Fr. Heilman asked his Spiritual Warriors to do as many of these daily devotions as possible:
 Pray in a State of Grace (Go to Confession) Believe God will answer our prayers October 20 – October 28 – Novena #1 – Pray the St.</description>

      <title>Dottie Bailey Won</title>

      <description>Dottie Bailey defeated Rockwood School Board President Matt Doell in the Republican primary for Missouri House District 110. Dottie now faces Democrat Cody Kelley in November.
Dottie is a phenomenal campaigner. She knocked on over 4,000 doors between April and August. Her efforts resulted in an enormous 19 percentage-point win despite being outspent by her opponent. Making Dottie&amp;rsquo;s more impressive is the fact that Doell had been elected to the Rockwood board three times while this was Dottie&amp;rsquo;s first race ever.</description>

      <title>Primary Fast: Day 14</title>
      <link>https://hennessysview.com/2018/08/06/primary-fast-day-14/</link>

      <description>You made it. If you began the Fast with me, today is the last day of skipping breakfast and lunch. (Unless you decide to makeone-meal-a-day a permanent habit.)
What Fasting Can Do Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened to you during the fast (if you followed the prescription):
 You probably lost about five pounds. Your pants feel looser. You pull your belt a notch tighter. You saved money. (I saved $98.)  You learned that food is an option most of the time.</description>

      <title>Doell&#39;s Soul Roe&#39;s Latest Victim</title>

      <description>Personally, I like Jeff Roe, the political consultant.
He called me the night before Ted Cruz announced his run for president. I was honored, frankly. As Senator Cruz&amp;rsquo;s campaign manager, Mr. Roe had much bigger fish to fry that night. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that Jeff holds no grudges. He genuinely cares about the opposing candidates even while he viciously destroys their careers. I have no doubt Mr. Roe has many great qualities as a person, and I know he has amazing talents as a political operative and strategist.</description>

      <title>Bad Judgment on Rockwood School Board (or something worse?)</title>
      <link>https://hennessysview.com/2018/07/31/bad-judgment-rockwood-school-board/</link>

      <description>Everyone remembers the horrible audit of the Rockwood School District.
** $1.2 million wasted in double payments ** Contracts awarded to a construction company that had one of its executives on the board ** Feeble, &amp;ldquo;arrogant&amp;rdquo; response to the audit from board members ** Bad management!
But the worst example of cronyism and arrogance went largely unreported. (The great Elliott Davis caught it, though. Video to follow.)
Rockwood Board&amp;rsquo;s Secret Response The late auditor Tom Schweich released Rockwood&amp;rsquo;s horrible audit on February 28, 2013.</description>

      <title>Quick Math Facts on Rockwood School District Tax History. UPDATE: RDS Servers Bouncing?</title>

      <description>One of the candidates running for the state House of Representatives in District 110 has been on the Rockwood School Board since 2011. In a campaign mailer, this candidate claims he&amp;rsquo;s cut taxes in the district. Is that true?
Well, it&amp;rsquo;s true that the property tax rate in Rockwood has been reduced twice during his tenure. But that&amp;rsquo;s not even close to the whole picture. Since the 2010-2011 school year, when this candidate joined the board, Rockwood has raised taxes 5 times.</description>

      <title>All Politicians Treat Constitutents Well</title>

      <description>Some people complain about politicians not representing their constituents well. I disagree. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my life, all politicians do a great job of representing their constituents. They really do.
If I&amp;rsquo;m right about politicians being 100% true to their constituents, then why are so many voters so unhappy with the people they voted for? It&amp;rsquo;s simple: the voters aren&amp;rsquo;t every politician&amp;rsquo;s constituents. That&amp;rsquo;s right. Not all politicians consider the people who vote for them constituents.</description>

      <title>Doc of the Decade Is Almost Here. Watch the Trailer</title>

      <description>This is the most important documentary of the decade.
https://youtu.be/X_AyP9SAEJc  What can you do? Start close to home.
Don&amp;rsquo;t tolerate intolerance. Don&amp;rsquo;t curb your tongue. And don&amp;rsquo;t elect whimps to government. Missouri&amp;rsquo;s legislature needs every person with spine it find.
You don&amp;rsquo;t want a mouse in the House.
And Dottie Bailey has no places for safe spaces.
If you live in Wildwood, Eureka, or Pacific areas, vote for Dottie Bailey.</description>

      <title>A Candidate With Skin in the Game</title>

      <description>*Ninety-eight percent of Americans - plumbers, dentists, bus drivers - have skin in the game. We have to worry about the 2 percent - the intellectuals and politicians making the big decisions who don’t have skin in the game and are messing the whole thing up for everybody else. Thirty years ago, the French National Assembly was composed of shop owners, farmers, doctors, veterinarians, and small-town lawyers—people involved in daily activities.</description>
