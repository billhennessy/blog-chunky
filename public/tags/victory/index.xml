      <description>For the past four years. conservatives have worried more about being right while liberals worried about winning.
We all know how that worked out.
It doesn’t matter how right you are if you’re powerless.Right now we are.
Satisfied?
I didn’t think so.

After four years of 5,000 Leap and Constitution study groups, of Constitutional workshops, and rallies in the park, let’s make a vow to ourselves and to each other: We’re Done With Losing.</description>

      <description>A couple years ago, a lot of folks believed that victory in 2010 would be a cakewalk. Led by Tea Party activists, the GOP picked up over 800 legislative seats, state and federal, in the 2010 off-year election. Rumors of the Republican Party&amp;rsquo;s death had been greatly exaggerated.
  
Or so it seemed.
Novels and action movies involve a hero&amp;rsquo;s quest. The main character hopes to accomplish something. Dorothy wants to return to Kansas.</description>

      <description>_**&amp;ldquo;For over a thousand years Roman conquerors returning from the wars enjoyed the honor of triumph, a tumultuous parade. In the procession came trumpeteers, musicians and strange animals from conquered territories, together with carts laden with treasure and captured armaments. The conquerors rode in a triumphal chariot, the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him. Sometimes his children robed in white stood with him in the chariot or rode the trace horses.</description>

      <description>On November 5, 1980, ABC News Nightline was devoted to the aftermath of the election. Ronald Reagan won 51-41 over incumbent Jimmy Carter. Republicans took the Senate and picked up 30+ seats in the house.
The YouTube clip below shows us only the beginning of the program. But it’s a great reminder of what lies ahead for movement conservatives. Well, what lies ahead IF we continue to focus on moving the conversation toward first principles and away from the class warfare and Balkanization that Democrats love so much.</description>
