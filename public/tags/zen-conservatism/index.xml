      <description>** You Can Order My Book Online Today **Zen Conservatism is now available in paperback.
    I began this book in December 2008, just after the election. My goal was to produce a book that would inspire people to restore our republic. At the time, conservatives were disheartened, dismayed, and distracted.
Then the Tea Party movement began, and I had to put my book project on hold. But thanks to your work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to return to my project.</description>

      <description>My new ebook, Zen Conservatism, will be available for download ($9.50) within the week. To prepare, I’ve posted the first chapter which you can download for free.
Here’s more about the book:
You consider yourself a patriot and a proud American.
You have become more and more concerned about the direction your country is headed.
You wish you could just yell “STOP!” –and someone would listen.
“Zen Conservatism,” was written for you.</description>
