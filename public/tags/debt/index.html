America’s fiscal year is October 1 to September 30. With two month left in FY16, the U.S. Treasury has already paid creditors $380,925,428,211.67 in interest costs. (That’s $381 Billion) https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm
The average interest rate was just over 2%. https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/pd/avg/2016/2016_07.htm
 It is expected that the last two month’s of this fiscal year, interest costs will increase another $45 to $66 Billion. The total FY16 interest cost may be between $426 and $447 Billion.

                The greatest mob movie of all time was Get Shorty. (Please, don’t argue.) The whole movie revolved around this exchange:
 Ronnie Wingate: Excuse me bro&amp;rsquo;, but who the fuck are you? Chili Palmer: I&amp;rsquo;m the one tellin&amp;rsquo; you how it is&amp;hellip;
 Last Sunday, Greece was Chili Palmer. A few days later, Angela Merkel is.

Funny how things change.
You probably heard that Greece’s Prime Minister called for a referendum on the troika’s terms.

                In 2008, we heard all about the youth movement for Obama. We heard that the enormous Millennial Generation, born between 1982 and 2001, would destroy the GOP and everything America once stood for&amp;ndash;like jobs, family, faith, and hard work. And when Obama won, many believed the tales of the Obama Youth.

But many were wrong. Voters under 30 have had it with vague promises and glittering bullshit from that punk from Chicago.

                Is the US economy about to collapse worse the Greece’s?
Some, like Paul Krugman, say that it’s okay for governments to print unlimited money. Others, who have actually managed businesses, say otherwise.
**David Stockman is among the latter. He was Reagan’s budget director for a few years. He became a media sensation because of his command of numbers. **
He left the White House early, fretting over federal debt. But debt in the 1980s was as a piggy bank to Wells Fargo.

Because so many school systems have driven great English literature out of students’ hands and minds, it’s possible that some kids never read Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol. If you’ve never read this classic, please do so now. You need it.

Back? Good. Fascinating stuff, isn’t it? And so much more accessible than David Copperfield, which was my introduction to Dickens.

Here’s how I replied:
 Johnny,
 Sorry that I&amp;rsquo;m just getting to this. I get a lot of email, and sometimes I miss things.
I organized the tea party in St. Louis in 2009. I did so because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that governments accumulate power until they crush liberty and freedom.

 Obama says he’s “ready to move**” on debt ceiling. **
 Really? The man who dug a deeper debt hole in two years than anyone else did in 8—or 15—is willing to borrow more?
Say it ain’t so.
For those who believe Obama’s some sort of deficit hawk, let’s take a quick stroll down memory.
 Obama wanted to increase the debt limit by $2.

                Your FICO score is a number between 380 and 820 (or something like that) that banks use to determine your credit worthiness. The higher your FICO score, the better.
But that’s not what I’m talking about here.
I’m talking about your FICA score.

Your FICA score is the minimum payment on your federal loan.
You didn’t know you had a federal loan? You do.
If you’re 18 years old, you owe the federal government about $46,000.

                Obama showed his breaking point today. The stress got to him.
Today Obama threatened to stop Social Security payments if Congress doesn’t bend to his will on the debt ceiling.
The president told reporters that there may not be enough money to pay Social Security benefits on and after August 3rd.
But the President lies.
Revenue from taxes and other fees would cover Social Security and other payments. What won’t be covered is additional borrowing to service the country’s already outrageous debt.

                With the debt ceiling negotiations closing in, it’s worth looking to Thomas Jefferson.

Jefferson was very opposed to federal government borrowing. (He was less concerned with states borrowing.) What I love about the quote below is Jefferson’s concern for leisure time.
 &amp;ldquo;To preserve [the] independence [of the people,] we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.

In this case, the issue is the massive U.S. debt and what that debt is about to do to America.

So responsible states now have to pay for irresponsible states at the point of a federal gun.
It looks like the Democrats want to completely bankrupt America before they lose power in January.
Of course, this also gives empty suits like Russ Carnahan an excuse not to debate their opponents, talk to constituents, or hold town halls.

                What if: In January, a new Republican Congress is sworn in. First up on the agenda? A bi-partisan report stating that Congress must enact the most draconian tax increases and entitlement cuts in history or face total economic collapse.

That’s the scenario developing.
President Obama appointed a bi-partisan commission to make recommendations about the US government’s debt. The commission will not report out until after the November 2010 elections, but the leaders—Republican Alan Simpson and Democrat Erskine Bowles&amp;ndash;have given some warning about what we can expect.

                An arrogant and distracted Barack Obama appeared at a press conference for the G20 Summit today. His purpose: to insult, threaten, and cajole the American people from an international stage.
 I&amp;rsquo;m doing it because I said I was going to do it and I think it&amp;rsquo;s the right thing to do. People should learn that lesson about me because next year when I start presenting some very difficult choices to the country, I hope some of these folks who are hollering about deficits and debt step-up because I&amp;rsquo;m calling their bluff.

                Break out the Depression Glasses to toast the Obama Administration’s latest foray into economic disaster. Just posted on WSJ.com:
 BREAKING: The Federal Reserve and other central banks open a credit line to send dollars to Europe to ease debt crisis.
 Yes, folks. Your taxes are going up, your kids are going deeper into debt, to bail out lazy, overpaid, spoiled Greek socialists. Thank your president.
The U.S. move follows a panicked decision by EU leaders to pump hundreds of billions of $$ into failing socialist economies in Europe to avert a global economic collapse.

                As I waited to appear on Larry Kudlow’s show last Friday, I heard Larry announce over and over again that he’s sick of hearing about Greece’s problems. Greece isn’t America. The U.S. economy is booming, and Greece can’t hurt it.
I didn’t tell Larry, but I think he was wrong.
Greece’s problems will hurt the American economy because Greece’s problems foreshadow a far more dangerous crash headed to America.
Markets are people.

                The mounting government debt&amp;ndash;$2.98 trillion in recent bailouts and stimuli alone&amp;ndash;is an oppressive anchor around the neck of every American. Currently, every family of 3 is obliged to pay over $118,000 in the next 30 years. That&amp;rsquo;s a house payment with a variable-rate. In other words, the government has done exactly what helped cause the mess for individuals by borrowing beyond its means at a teaser rate of 0.8 percent. That Teaser Rate Will Skyrocket

                _The debtor is a slave to his lender. _
Americans hold hundreds of billions of dollars in credit card debt alone. To this add automobiles, student loans, mortgages, medical, and myriad personal loans and you arrive at the staggering figure of$2.55 trillion with a &amp;lsquo;t&amp;rsquo;. 
This massive debt&amp;ndash;encouraged and backed by the US Government&amp;ndash;makes us miserable. Seriously. Are you happy? If the debtor is slave to his lender, then the US Government is slave to China and Japan.
