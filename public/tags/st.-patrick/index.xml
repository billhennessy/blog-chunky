      <description>You probably heard that a bunch of witches are gathering in New York City today to put hexes on Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump, and others. Don&amp;rsquo;t take this lightly. Father Richard Heilman and folks at the Holy League have asked Christians to pray the Lorica of St. Patrick for Justice Kavanaugh, substituting &amp;ldquo;Brett Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Justice Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; for the first person pronouns.
This is a powerful prayer that&amp;rsquo;s more than 1,500 years old!</description>

      <description>You will find yourself saying this out loud as if it we&amp;rsquo;re a great soliloquy. This prayer is pure strength. (Updated with version found in [The Manual for Men](https://www.catholiccompany.com/manual-for-men-i124864/?aid=5417&amp;amp;new=yes&amp;amp;engine=email&amp;amp;trk_msg=2AU5FNSK4LQ4T2GBU5CVDHAA8G&amp;amp;trk_contact=1UJPB3PSL771MPT7G3JA8S5V8G&amp;amp;trk_sid=OP0ED4DVFP6GGATLOQK32FOHO0&amp;amp;utm_source=Listrak&amp;amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;amp;utm_term=Product&amp;amp;utm_campaign=06_30_18_Mystery_Promo_Last_Day&amp;amp;utm_content=POSTCARD).)
Lorica (Breastplate) of St. Patrick I bind to myself today the strong virtue of an Invocation of the Trinity: I believe the Trinity in the Unity the Creator of the Universe.
I bind to myself today the virtue of the Incarnation of Christ with His Baptism, the virtue of His crucifixion with His burial, the virtue of His Resurrection with His Ascension, the virtue of His coming on the Judgement Day.</description>
