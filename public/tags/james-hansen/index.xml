      <description>Watts Up With That has a graph illustrating the ridiculous extent to which James Hansen has gone to perpetuate his global warming myth. Hansen has rewritten US temperature data of the past 2 centuries&amp;ndash;as if he was there.
It&amp;rsquo;s time for NASA to fire Hansen. The DOJ should open a fraud investigation.

      <description>Two quick global warming notes.
Arctic Sea Ice Extend Growing
Not too long ago, Al Gore told German school kids that the North Pole, Santa, Polar Bears, and puppies would all be dead and rotting hunks of diseased fleshed in barren, desserts that were once the Arctic Sea by the time they entered high school. Turns out that the Arctic Sea Ice Extent for 2007-08 and 2008-09 is pretty much in the average for entire history of measured sea ice extent (1979 to present).</description>

      <description>While my flaming headline (&amp;quot;Dr. James Hansen of GISS is a Liar and Fraud&amp;quot;) received a fair amount of attention, people a lot smarter than I are carefully documenting the facts that led to my unavoidable conclusion.
One such appears on the Telegraph today. Christopher Booker (corrected link) notes that Dr. Hansen&amp;rsquo;s GISS center is alone in seeing continued warming throughout the world. Pointing out that laws supported by Hansen, Al Gore, and others will cost tens of trillions of dollars and severely limit freedoms throughout the world for the generations, Booker rightly contends that those proposing such a retreat from liberty be damn well sure they&amp;rsquo;re right.</description>
