      <description>Perhaps the most famous of all of Karl Marx’s writings was the clause “you have nothing to lose but your chains.”
Many people still believe that human beings are chained to corporate masters. Writers like Seth Godin talk about an awakening in which workers refuse to remain cogs in someone else’s machine.
These well-meaning people (some are well-meaning, anyway) have no problem, though with giving more power to a handful of slave-masters in Washington.</description>
