      <description>Something weird happened in the stock market today.
Yesterday I blogged about the stock markets. I&amp;rsquo;d been up early to see what was going on in Europe and Asia. I was watching US futures, too.
I decided to write about what might happen. And I told you about Ben Hunt, my favorite economics writer. Ben combines remarkable knowledge of game theory and psychology with his genius in finance and economics.</description>

      <description>Eurozone&amp;rsquo;s economy is basically in recession.
Walmart lowered expectations. Again.
The world is teetering on the edge of World War.
The US is launching Iraq War 3.0: Mission Accomplished Accomplished.
Germany&amp;rsquo;s economy is flat, and Italy and France are getting worse.
Risk is high.
Corporate debt is staggering.
The Fed&amp;rsquo;s balance sheet is a sea of monetized debt.
The central banks have nothing left to fix another crash.
And the stock markets are rocketing to record highs because of all this news.</description>

      <description>I just blogged about the bad, sad events in St. Louis, Missouri, today. A 22-year-old police officer shot to death on duty; a famous, majestic church burned.
But looking around the internet, I find bad news all over. It was one of those days when the world&amp;rsquo;s rhythms crossed into bad vibes.
Some of those vibrations shook the earth in Peru, to the tune of 8.0 on the Richter scale, killing at least 850, probably more.</description>
