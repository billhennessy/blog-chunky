      <description>Apparently Bush&amp;rsquo;s plan to socialize all of America before leaving the White House is alive and well. Some sort of a crappy deal has been reached.
The plan includes a car czar&amp;ndash;something that Toyata, Nissan, and Honda miraculously do not need&amp;ndash;to run the auto industry like a DMV license office. The last time a government designed, built, and sold an automobile like, it was called the Yugo. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep my SUV, thanks.</description>
