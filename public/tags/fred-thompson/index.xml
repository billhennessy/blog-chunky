      <description>Today is the Wyoming Republican caucus. Unfortunately, I know no one from Wyoming, though I do have a few business acquaintances from Montana. My cousin Bob lived in Wyoming for a few years after college, from whence he hitch-hiked to St. Louis for the annual Hennessy St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day party at Uncle Jim&amp;rsquo;s. Since I have no one to appeal to directly, I hope some Wyomingites stumple upon my humble blog and decide to wander to their county convention and cast a vote for conservatism in the person of Fred Thompson.</description>

      <description>A new CBS News poll of 302 Republicans shows that Rudy Giuliani has widened his lead over Fred Thompson. Captain&amp;rsquo;s Quarters breaks down the unreliability of CBS, the problems with the sample, etc, so I won&amp;rsquo;t repeat that here.
Instead, let&amp;rsquo;s say the numbers are correct and Fred Thompson is fading fast. Two questions come up: Why? and What of it?
Why: Interest in Thompson as the non-candidate peaked in late June and the first week of July.</description>

Those of us whose conservative conversions occured in the late 1970s and early 1980s, I think, are particularly fascinated by the 10th Amendment to the Constitution. We also mourn over its senseless destruction by Congress, courts, and citizens.

      <title>Thompson to Announce in September</title>

      <description>THIS IS HENNESSY&amp;rsquo;S VIEW&amp;rsquo;S 1000TH POST SINCE AUGUST, 2000
As an act of courtesy to the politics-weary American public, Fred Thompson is likely to announce his candidacy for the GOP nomination for President in September, according to columnist-reporterRobert Novak.
Thompson&amp;rsquo;s late entry may reverse a trend in recent years in which the next presidential campaign begins before the last one ends. If Thompson believes the people will be sick of Giuliani, Clinton, and Obama by the time the Super Bowl comes around, he may be right.</description>
