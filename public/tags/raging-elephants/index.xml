      <description>I blogged aboutthe battle of the Tea Party&amp;rsquo;s future going on around the Lake of the Ozarks recently.
I received this response from Freida Keough, St. Louis County Director ofMissouri Precinct Project:
 My answer: We have 56 positions for committeemen and women in 28 Townships for St.Louis County. Did you know that 35 new individuals filed for these positions in addition to the incumbents. Coincidence? I don&amp;rsquo;t think this happened because people felt they have nothing else to do.</description>
