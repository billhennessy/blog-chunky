      <description>You probably remember that I love The Conservative Heart by Arthur C. Brooks. I learned so much reading that book, and learning feels great. I read a lot and I&amp;rsquo;m 52-years-old, and I&amp;rsquo;m amazed at how much I didn&amp;rsquo;t know. And it feels so good to learn, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?
Idle Hands Are the Devil&amp;rsquo;s Workshop One of my favorite stories in The Conservative Heart involves the city of Marienthal, Austria, in the 1930s.</description>

      <description>This weekend, MoveOnUp.org held its first conference. The location was the Crowne Plaza Hotel at the airport. The event launched the Sherman T. Parker Scholarship for African-American Political Science students.
But that’s not the big story.
The big story is this: MoveOnUp.org has cheated history.
Why “cheated?” Because the past 50 years of American liberal history has prepared American blacks for one purpose: compliance.
Using victimhood, welfare, crime, destructive education, and programs designed to destroy families, American liberals from Ted Kennedy to Barack Obama chained African-Americans to “Uncle Sam’s Plantation,” as Star Parker so aptly puts it.</description>
