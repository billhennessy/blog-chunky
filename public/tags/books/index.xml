      <description>Someone you know is PERFECT for this book. It might be you.
Here you are, looking at your device, reading these words, and trying to figure out the Trump thing. Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve figured it out, but you want to know how people like you think about it. Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;re all-in for Trump, but you need help talking to your friends or family about your Trumpism. You might be thinking this book is for you.</description>

      <description>Most of my readers asked for a print edition of my new book, Fight to Evolve: The Government&amp;rsquo;s Secret War on NTX.
Great news! Your book is waiting for you on Amazon. It&amp;rsquo;s just $17.99, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to know that I don&amp;rsquo;t get a penny from the sales. All proceeds go to the Coalition for Safer Drinking and its fight to reduce alcohol&amp;rsquo;s negative effects on health.
If you, like me, prefer electronic books, you can get the Kindle version of Fight to Evolve for just $3.</description>

      <description>For the past four years. conservatives have worried more about being right while liberals worried about winning.
We all know how that worked out.
It doesn’t matter how right you are if you’re powerless.Right now we are.
Satisfied?
I didn’t think so.

After four years of 5,000 Leap and Constitution study groups, of Constitutional workshops, and rallies in the park, let’s make a vow to ourselves and to each other: We’re Done With Losing.</description>

      <description>The St. Louis Cardinals were the major league team farthest west and farthest south until the 1950s. But that’s not the only reason the Redbirds built a massive flock of fans from the Alleghenies to the Rockies, and from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
The St. Louis Cardinals owe big government statism and technological innovation a big thanks, in addition to geography and great teams. The technology was radio. The big government statist?</description>

      <title>What are the Perfect Ingredients of Great Book?</title>

      <description>Writers are always looking for the perfect topic for a book. But there’s a problem.
What’s important to me may not be important to you. And what you to read about, I might not care about.
That’s why great books achieve a certain universality. They touch on the essence of life itself, of humanity itself, of existence.
Some say that the secret to perfectly spellbinding stories is a mixture of just three elements: sex, food, and spirit.</description>

      <title>8 Things to Read in 2011</title>

      <description>This week last year, I read The 5000 Year Leap. Good book. If you haven’t read it, do so. You might learn some interesting things.
But don’t expect The 5000 Year Leap to change you. Or history. It won’t.
Now, if 70 percent of the US population read it, it might make a difference. Or maybe not. I tend to doubt it, but that’s fodder for a different post.
When tea partiers read books like Glenn Beck’s Common Sense or The 5000 Year Leap, we’re not broadening ourselves—we’re narrowing ourselves.</description>
