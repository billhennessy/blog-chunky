      <description>What made Rush Limbaugh so amazing for 24 years was his steadfast resolve. Face it, you have to believe what you believe title your books The Way Things Ought To Be and See, I Told You So.
His fans loved him because he never backed down.
Rush didn’t back down when the left went nuts over his “Obama, The Magic Negro” parody. He didn’t back down from his “hope Obama fails” statement.</description>
