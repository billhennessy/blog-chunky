      <description>Everyone remembers the horrible audit of the Rockwood School District.
** $1.2 million wasted in double payments ** Contracts awarded to a construction company that had one of its executives on the board ** Feeble, &amp;ldquo;arrogant&amp;rdquo; response to the audit from board members ** Bad management!
But the worst example of cronyism and arrogance went largely unreported. (The great Elliott Davis caught it, though. Video to follow.)
Rockwood Board&amp;rsquo;s Secret Response The late auditor Tom Schweich released Rockwood&amp;rsquo;s horrible audit on February 28, 2013.</description>

      <description>The will of man is not shattered, but softened, bent, and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy, but it prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, but it compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.</description>

      <description>Fate moves in mysterious ways.
Just days before State Auditor and Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Schweich died, Eric Greitens announced an exploratory committee. Greitens wants to test the water of a possible run for Missouri Governor as a Republican.
Greitens would be, perhaps, the most remarkable human being ever to pursue the office of Governor of Missouri. Here’s a sampling of Greitens’s achievements:
 Humanitarian who’s worked in Rwanda, Bosnia, Central America, India and other disaster zones—usually man-made disaster zones Boxer who won championships in England Rhodes Scholar who completed the program at Oxford Navy SEAL who earned the Bronze Star among other accolades in four tours in Iraq Founder of The Mission Continues to give wounded veterans a mission and a purpose in life Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world Forbes’ Magazine’s 50 greatest leaders in the world  Purpose Over Party Greitens is no ideologue.</description>

      <description>News of Auditor Tom Schweich&amp;rsquo;s death hit me hard. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported to day that my friend Tom Schweich died of a gunshot wound today. Tom was 54.
I am saddened by this news. I pray for Tom&amp;rsquo;s family and for his rapid entry to eternal happiness.
May perpetual light shine on him, and may his soul and all the souls of all the faithful departed rest in peace.</description>

      <title>34 to 0: Good Ideas Are Hard to Fight</title>

      <description>I was scared. Not afraid to say it.
And some friends turned hostile. They had good reasons. And I was probably a little cavalier. And I talked way too long.
But last September I wanted to start something that would help real people in our neighborhood while advancing liberty and upsetting abusive government. Sure, I&amp;rsquo;d rather upset the federal government in Washington, but my arms are little short to box with Harry Reid.</description>
