      <description>“It’s your life. You don’t know how long it’s gonna last, but you know it doesn’t end well. You’ve gotta move forward … as soon as you can figure out what that means.” —Don Draper, Mad Men, Season two, Six Month Leave
 Dear People of Houston (and thereabouts),
President Trump has said, &amp;ldquo;the whole world is watching.&amp;rdquo; And he&amp;rsquo;s right!
When people say &amp;ldquo;the whole world is watching,&amp;rdquo; they usually mean it as a warning.</description>

      <title>Now, America Is Back!</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been saying &amp;ldquo;America is back&amp;rdquo; ever since President Trump&amp;rsquo;s beautiful inauguration in January. And we meant it.
  But &amp;ldquo;America is back&amp;rdquo; rose to a higher level today. A level not since the days following 9-11. Or maybe the greatest moments of the Reagan administration.
Today, in Houston, we saw the America of our dreams. The America that makes us cry when we hear the national anthem. Or when we see a soldier in Iraq bending down to help a tiny Iraqi child.</description>
