      <description>A friend and colleague paid me a huge compliment recently. A compliment I didn&amp;rsquo;t deserve. He said something about trying to mimic my writing style. That&amp;rsquo;s an ego-booster, for sure, but, well, I don’t really have a writing style. I cheat.
See, I experiment with every writing tool I hear about, and I stick with the ones that measurably improve my writing. Especially when they work as I write (because I hate editing and revision, as you can tell).</description>

      <description>I was a pretender.
In 2012, I pretended I believed Mitt Romney would win. But I knew better. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the heart to tell the truth to the volunteers banging doors and working call lists from our election office in South County.
But I knew Romney would lose. I suspected the GOP would not regain the Senate.
When some of our hardest workers showed up to help break down the office and move our belongings, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t look at them.</description>
