      <description>When I was in high school I wanted to be a US Senator.
Wait, that wasn’t the punch line.
That ambition changed, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad it did. It was a bad ambition.
Steve Jobs wanted to build an enduring company that made insanely great products that people loved. Thank God he pursued and achieved his ambition, because it was good and noble.
What’s the difference? It’s not that one ambition was personal and one involved others.</description>
