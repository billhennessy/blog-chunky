      <description>Pack clothes, flags, and signs for an Obamacare Tea Party at Forest Park on Art Hill this week. The rally will begin at 7:00 PM on the day the Supreme Court rules.

We don’t know the day, but we do know the time: 7:00 pm in Forest Park on Art Hill (map below). The most likely days are Monday or Thursday, but because of the magnitude of this case, it could be any day of the week.</description>

      <description>July 4, 2011, felt hollow, like celebrating the birthday of someone deceased.
Independence Day celebrates the birth of an idea: that people create governments and empower them, not the other way around.
Do we still believe that?

Yes, I still believe that. Morally, at least. And you probably do, too.
Does America still believe that government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed? Or do we, as a nation, believe that government has a monopoly on liberty and dispenses it at its will?</description>
