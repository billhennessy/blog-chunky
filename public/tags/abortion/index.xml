      <description>The abortion company fires its CEOs as sloppily as it delivers &amp;ldquo;healthcare.&amp;rdquo;
Before that, the Trump Administration successfully cut some of Planned Parenthood&amp;rsquo;s federal funding, which may have precipitated the decapitation of its management team.
And, today, Planned Parenthood&amp;rsquo;s hand-picked judge tentatively ruled in complete favor with the journalist the company is suing.
Aborting Dr. Wen On Wednesday, Planned Parenthood clumsily fired Dr. Leana Wen as its chief executive. I guess you could call it a late-term firing, since Dr.</description>

      <description>Outcomes.
NeverTrumpers seem to believe that the act of voting is a sort of magic spell that can right all past wrongs. Psychologists call this &amp;ldquo;magical thinking.&amp;rdquo; Children do it. Magical thinking is the belief that we can change the outside world with our thoughts. Think of rain dances and crossed fingers. Or, as Dr. Ben Hunt explains, Fed policy.
Father Christopher J. Pollard, writing in Catholic News Agency, destroys the NeverTrump argument in his essay &amp;ldquo;On Voting.</description>

      <description>Some pro-life activists like Erick Erickson are plotting ways to sabotage Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s candidacy for president. They probably haven&amp;rsquo;t stopped to think. If they succeed in defeating Trump, they will be culpable in many, many abortions. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of guilt for a guy like Erickson to carry around, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?
Chances are Congress won&amp;rsquo;t introduce any major abortion laws in the next four years. That means the abortion battle will remain in the courts.</description>

      <description>Today was a particularly busy day for me.
I had a series of meetings. Like every hour, another meeting. From 9:00 on.
I saw the text from my wife. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to click on a video. I was in a room full of people. Important business. Major client and all that. And I completely misunderstood the &amp;ldquo;H/T Gina L.&amp;rdquo; thing. For some reason, I thought Angela was mad at Gina.</description>

      <description>I’m using abortion as an example, but this bit of science applies to all political messaging.
What’s wrong with this headline?

I’ll tell you what’s wrong with it. It shouts: “Everybody’s getting an abortion!” Even if connected with messages that say abortion is wrong.
In numerous studies, messages intended to discourage a behavior by promoting the number of people engaged in the behavior (called negative social proof) actually caused the behavior to increase.</description>
