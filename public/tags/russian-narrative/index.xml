      <description>When did the narrative break?
Was it the assassination attempt on GOP Congressmen?
Was it Comey&amp;rsquo;s admission that Trump was never under investigation?
Was it Kathy Griffin&amp;rsquo;s grim ISIS imitation?
Was it Trump&amp;rsquo;s 5-0 winning streak in special elections?
Like the ageless question of how many licks it takes to get to the Tootsie-Roll center of a Tootsie-Pop, the world may never know. Never know just when the Russian narrative broke.</description>
