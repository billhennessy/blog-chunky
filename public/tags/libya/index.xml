      <description>ABC News is not known as President Obama’s loudest critic. More like his Amen corner. So it’s headline screams even louder:
Defense Secretary: Libya Did Not Pose Threat to U.S., Was Not &amp;lsquo;Vital National Interest&amp;rsquo; to Intervene
The rest of Jake Tapper’s story gets more disturbing.
* The President and the Defense Secretary seem to disagree on national interest** The Secretary of State cannot articulate a consistent US policy** Hillary Clinton seems to believe that the UN is a legal alternative to the US Congress  More than week into a war that lacks even the thinnest thread of Constitutionality, Barack Obama seems clueless.</description>

      <description>Historians will mark March 19 as the day the Obama presidency reached its point of no return.
The image of a cowardly and selfish child-president flying to Brazil to launch a war will haunt his legacy, like Nixon’s vulgarities on tape in 1974. Obama’s war on Libya has doomed an already weak administration.
Today, Germany pulled out of NATO because of the bungled, late, and idiotic intervention. It appears, now, that the alliance that won the Cold War and help sustain two decades of peace could collapse under a lack of American leadership.</description>

      <description>When the US invaded Iraq in 2003, it do so with the clear intent of bringing its enemy—Saddam’s regime—to an unconditional surrender. That was the objective. Despite what happened after that objective was achieved, we went in with a clear and measurable purpose.
The motivating reason for our foray into Iraq was also clear. We believed at the time that Saddam Hussein’s possession of &amp;ndash; and desire for more &amp;ndash; weapons of mass destruction posed an imminent threat to US interests and citizens.</description>
