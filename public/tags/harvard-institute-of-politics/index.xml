      <description>Consider these numbers:
 * **9.8 million** * &amp;lt;del&amp;gt;**11.6 million **&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;**16.8 million** * **55%** * **61%**  Between the 2008 and 2012 elections:
 * 9.8 million people died*, 55% of them were reliable Republican voters * [16.8 &amp;lt;del&amp;gt;11.6&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt; million people reached voting age](https://www.civicyouth.org/you-ask-we-answer-16-8-million-new-youth-eligible-to-vote-in-2012/?%3E)--61% of them are semi-reliable Democrat voters  
Between those years, neither the GOP nor conservative leaning organizations did anything significant to deal with this **demographic cliff.</description>
