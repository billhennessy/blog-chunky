      <description>The first St. Louis Tea Partier was Michelle Moore. In the annals of the Tea Party movement, the first action was a conference call held February 20, 2009. The only St. Louisan known to be on that call was Michelle Moore.
Now, Michelle needs our help. Michelle needs a kidney. She details everything (in living color) on her blog, A Traditional Life Lived.
If you can help—if you can’t point a donor her way—please do.</description>
