      <description>I won’t blame the neighbors, but the neighbors knew.
Syed Farook and four or five others worked long hours in Farook’s San Bernardino garage for months leading up to a deadly Islamic terror attack last week.
Neighbors knew. They knew Farook and his Pakistani wife, Tashfeen Malik, were up to no good. But the neighbors said nothing until after the massacre at a center for the developmentally disabled.
**The suspicious neighbors were afraid, not of the Muslim terrorists, but of political correctness.</description>
