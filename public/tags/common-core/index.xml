      <description>I am so embarrassed.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know that Fred Sauer, Gretchen Logue, and Anne Gassel were suing Missouri over Common Core.
Did you know that?
(I probably knew it and forgot. Sorry.)
But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: THEY WON!!!!
Wait. YOU won. You won because Fred, Gretchen, and Anne stuck their necks out for you. And for me.
So Thank You! to Fred, Gretchen, and Anne. And this case seems really, really big.</description>
