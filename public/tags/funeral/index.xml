      <description>I ran to Walgreen’s at lunch. I needed some medication—maybe for a cold? I don’t remember for sure. While I was there, I picked up a Muscle Milk and a protein bar so I wouldn’t have to make another stop. I had only about 20 minutes to complete the circuit before my next meeting.
Returning to work, I hit a traffic jam in an unusual place. The outer road was backed up—something I’d never seen before.</description>
