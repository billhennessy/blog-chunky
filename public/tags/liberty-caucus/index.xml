      <description>Do you worry that conservative grassroots might get overconfident and blow our chance to stop the advance of socialism in America?
I do. I am concerned that we keep repeating the same tactics to the same audiences until both the audience and the actors become . . . well, bored.
When I read stories like this one, that GOP sentiment is at an all-time high, I worry that some on our side might decide they can go back to their regularly scheduled programming.</description>

 Today’s Wall Street rollercoaster ride should remind everyone of the disaster caused by government intervention in the housing market through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</description>
