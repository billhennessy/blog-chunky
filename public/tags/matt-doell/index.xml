      <description>Personally, I like Jeff Roe, the political consultant.
He called me the night before Ted Cruz announced his run for president. I was honored, frankly. As Senator Cruz&amp;rsquo;s campaign manager, Mr. Roe had much bigger fish to fry that night. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that Jeff holds no grudges. He genuinely cares about the opposing candidates even while he viciously destroys their careers. I have no doubt Mr. Roe has many great qualities as a person, and I know he has amazing talents as a political operative and strategist.</description>

      <description>[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_36429&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;210&amp;rdquo;] Droopy (or Disgusting?) Matt Doell[/caption]
Voters in House District 110 are asking why they received such a &amp;ldquo;disgusting&amp;rdquo; flyer from candidate Matt Doell.
Answer: Probably because he&amp;rsquo;s losing badly.
Matt Doell has decided to get dirty. And personal. And mean. (Horrible internals?)
While Dottie Bailey has knocked doors, attended coffees, and generally met with voters, Matt Doell rubbed elbows with hot-shots and union bosses and avoided anything that looks like an &amp;ldquo;ordinary person.</description>

      <description>Matt Doell made a desperate attempt to sick the MEC on Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View. Makes me so happy.
But the MEC shot Doell down like a hovering duck.
From the MEC&amp;rsquo;s official &amp;ldquo;Wah-wah&amp;rdquo; letter to the Doell campaign:
 Therefore, the Commission is not accepting this complaint.
 Doell&amp;rsquo;s failed complaint centers on my blog posts that criticize his performance as a member of the Rockwood School Board. For your convenience, here&amp;rsquo;s the list of my blogs criticizing Rockwood during Doell&amp;rsquo;s seven-year tenure:</description>
