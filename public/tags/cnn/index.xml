      <description>CNN screwed up. And it reminds me of an incident from 1970.
A headline writer admitted that the Antifa terror group seeks &amp;ldquo;peace through violence.&amp;rdquo; Later, presumably after receiving threats from Antifa terrorists, CNN removed the &amp;ldquo;peace through violence&amp;rdquo; sub-head.
But the damage was done. CNN stumbled onto real news. Real news that exposes Antifa&amp;rsquo;s terrorist aims.
Before we get to the dangers of normalizing political violence, aka &amp;ldquo;terrorism,&amp;rdquo; let&amp;rsquo;s remember a famous party.</description>

      <description>Maybe we should consider CNN employees enemy combatants.
CNN&amp;rsquo;s latest hate-crime: **CNN is criticizing London police for using too many bullets. **
That&amp;rsquo;s right. CNN will soon demand a UN war crimes tribunal to try, convict, and hang the London cops who put down the London Bridge terrorists.
  This photo caption appeared below this critical headline.
  CNN has not responded to my request for comments.
Specifically, I asked CNN to provide the exact number of rounds police are allowed to use to stop a terrorist.</description>

      <title>Finally Media Focus On America&#39;s Real Problem</title>

      <description>After years wasted as the press and politicians covered secondary matters, the major media have finally stepped up to address America&amp;rsquo;s deepest, most damaging problem. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about alleged plagiarism. And it&amp;rsquo;s about damn time.
While serious problems fester, the media and politicians waste precious time and energy covering the massacres of police officers by black militants and the slaughter of Bastille Day revelers by Islamic terrorists. Is it any wonder that 70 percent of Americans consider the country on the wrong track?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to share a secret about manipulation with you. Please do not use this powerful method for sinister deeds.
But first . . .
Disclosure 1: Before I get to the Master Manipulator Model, some important background. I work professionally in the field of persuasion and influence. I even invented a workshop that helps big companies make their stuff more persuasive.
The point is, I study persuasion, and manipulation is persuasion&amp;rsquo;s cousin.</description>

      <description>This is a Vine clip of the first explosion at the Boston Marathon. Fox 25 in Boston reported moments ago that organizers confirmed that bombs caused the explosions. Clearly many casualties.
“For the sake of His sorrowful passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world.”
