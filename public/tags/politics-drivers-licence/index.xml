      <description>Need to visit a federal building or military base after January 10? Your Missouri DL won&amp;rsquo;t work by itself.
If you have a Missouri drivers license or ID card but you do not have a passport or military ID, bring your Social Security card or your birth certificate.
That&amp;rsquo;s the word I got from Navy Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes.
The Department of Homeland Security informed Missouri last week that our state&amp;rsquo;s drivers licenses and ID cards will no longer serve as identification at federal agencies after January 10, 2016.</description>
