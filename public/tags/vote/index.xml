      <description>I get the feeling a lot of people think mid-term elections are like pre-season hockey. These people think the only election that counts is the presidential election.
These people are, frankly, idiots. Sorry. They are.
What&amp;rsquo;s at stake in less than two weeks is huge. One of the biggest mid-term elections in your lifetime. If you want it reduced to a simple either/or, here it is.
Donald Trump will be an unstoppable swamp drainer and job creator or a lame duck.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;d think being a political animal of sorts, election season would be my favorite time of year.
It&amp;rsquo;s not. I hate elections.
I hate the crappy, predictable radio ads (above all else). I know, they do it because it works. Well, not really, but I&amp;rsquo;m not going to give a free marketing statistics lesson here. (No one has any idea if the campaign formula works, because no body ever tries anything different.</description>

      <description>Go vote, please. Please. Vote now. Don’t Put It Off!!
Did you know that ObamaCare is my fault?
Of course, it is. Read my story below the clock.

**I didn’t vote in 2006. You know why? **
I put it off.
I decided not to stop on my way to work in the morning. Why? _I’ll have plenty of time tonight, _I thought. I’ll stop on my way home.</description>

      <description>Next Election: 4 weeks from today. I need a favor. This will only take you a minute (tops), but it’s very important that you do it right now.
I will step you through it.
  Get a pen or pencil and something to write on—preferably a journal or appointment calendar.
  Go to April 5, 2011, or write April 5, 2011, if not using a calendar or dated journal.</description>

      <description>[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1iBjVlg6lw&amp;amp;w;=480&amp;amp;h;=385] It&amp;rsquo;s been almost two years since we met. At the time, I had no idea where this was going. Or what I was doing.
I still don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, but we all know where America is headed.
Beginning Tuesday, because of your passionate, tireless efforts, America is returning to the right course to meet the destiny our founders envisioned.
On Tuesday, your vote, joined with millions of others, will turn the country around.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday, Missouri becomes the first state in the union to vote on ObamaCare. If being a Tea Partyer means anything, it means you vote Yes on Prop C on Tuesday. I urge not to wing it.
Most elections, I wake up and think “it’s election day.” Then I take a shower and go to work. I think about stopping to vote, but I don’t want to walk into the office at 9:00.</description>

      <title>St. Louis County Votes</title>
      <link>https://hennessysview.com/2010/04/05/st-louis-county-votes/</link>

      <description>Tomorrow, Tuesday, April 6, is Election Day in St. Louis County. In some places, especially throughout South County, the only measure on the ballot is Proposition A: a sales tax increase.
Prop A’s backers—principally County Exec Charlie Dooley and Chesterfield Mayor John Nations—claim this tax increase of up to $650 per family will allow Metro to grow. You know otherwise.
* Dooley and Nations cannot point to a specific plan. They point to four.</description>
