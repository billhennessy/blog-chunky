      <description>If you read my blog, you know I&amp;rsquo;ve had differences with Senator Ted Cruz. But the Senator has stepped up. Bigly! Only a gentleman would do what Cruz just did with his El Chapo bill.
Remember the GOP race? Cruz and Trump went at each other like nobody&amp;rsquo;s business. Wives and all. While Cruz couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring himself to endorse Trump at the convention, Ted has stepped up a lot since the election.</description>
