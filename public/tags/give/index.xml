      <description>This is a challenge.
I want you to grab a pen and paper (or open your favorite note app). Now write down a list of characteristic you’d expect a **superhero_ _**to display. Write as many or as few as you’d like.
Don’t continue until you’ve written down the characteristics of a superhero.

Welcome back.
Here’s the next step. I want you to look over your list of superhero traits. As you do, think about the amount of that trait you have in you.</description>
