      <description>Usually, I’m against any government adding anything to its list of functions. But our friend Carl Bearden points out a novel and needed commission proposed by Missouri State Senator Gary Nodler. If enacted, Senate Bill No. 587 would require Missouri to establish a 10th Amendment Commission.
Here’s language directly from the proposed bill:
 The commission shall examine actions of the federal government toward the state, and refer cases to the attorney general when the federal government takes steps that require the state or a state officer to enact or enforce a provision of federal law that lies outside Congress&amp;rsquo;s enumerated powers and intrudes on the sovereignty reserved to the states by the tenth amendment to the United States Constitution.</description>
