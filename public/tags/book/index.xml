      <description>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s outstanding,&amp;rdquo; said the Great One.
 The Republican leadership in Congress doesn’t have the guts to go to the floor of the Senate or the floor of the House and make these charges. This is outstanding. You can’t let Hillary Clinton get away with her corruption, her cronyism, her criminality. I don’t care who you support or don’t support. She’s detestable.

      <description>Do you want to know what Trump supporters are thinking? Many people do.
If you supported Ted Cruz, you might not understand how the guy who wrote The Conservative Manifesto in 1993 could support Trump.
If you supported Marco Rubio or Ben Carson last year, how do you reconcile your convictions with Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s bizarre life?
Is Donald Trump a conservative or not?
I&amp;rsquo;ve written a new book about all these things, and you can buy your copy soon.</description>

      <description>** You Can Order My Book Online Today **Zen Conservatism is now available in paperback.
I began this book in December 2008, just after the election. My goal was to produce a book that would inspire people to restore our republic. At the time, conservatives were disheartened, dismayed, and distracted.
Then the Tea Party movement began, and I had to put my book project on hold. But thanks to your work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to return to my project.</description>
