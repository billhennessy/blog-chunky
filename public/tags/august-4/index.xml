      <description>July 4, 2011, felt hollow, like celebrating the birthday of someone deceased.
Independence Day celebrates the birth of an idea: that people create governments and empower them, not the other way around.

Does America still believe that government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed? Or do we, as a nation, believe that government has a monopoly on liberty and dispenses it at its will?</description>
