      <description>On November 5, 1980, ABC News Nightline was devoted to the aftermath of the election. Ronald Reagan won 51-41 over incumbent Jimmy Carter. Republicans took the Senate and picked up 30+ seats in the house.
The YouTube clip below shows us only the beginning of the program. But it’s a great reminder of what lies ahead for movement conservatives. Well, what lies ahead IF we continue to focus on moving the conversation toward first principles and away from the class warfare and Balkanization that Democrats love so much.</description>

      <description>Boston.com reports that social conservatives are &amp;ldquo;coalescing&amp;rdquo; around Fred Thompson as their choice for Republican nominee for President in 2008.
 &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a consensus developing around him that&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear and pretty profound,&amp;rdquo; said John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, an Orlando-based conservative group. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anything like it in 25 years in politics.&amp;rdquo;
 I agree. In 1979, as a high school sophomore with a National Review subscription, I became dissatisfied (for a short time) with the GOP.</description>
