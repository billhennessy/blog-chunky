      <description>A Washington Post/ABC News poll shows a major shift in sentiment toward (against?) the tea party movement.
I would not challenge the accuracy of the results which show the tea party’s popularity waning among Southerners and people 18 to 29. In fact, the poll shows that a full 50 percent of Americans now have a negative view of the tea party.
Sure, there may have been some chicanery with the questions to skew the results.</description>
