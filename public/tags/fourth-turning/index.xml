      <description>Millennials seem to believe anything that comes from the mouth of an &amp;ldquo;expert.&amp;rdquo; Even the older Millennials are probably too green to realize that listening to experts will produce worse results than going with your gut.
It works like this . . . when we go with our gut (or some non-expert&amp;rsquo;s suggestion), we build in a wide margin for error. We recognize the fallibility of our own judgment and proceed with due caution.</description>

      <description>Soon thereafter, this great gate is sealed by the Crisis resolution, when victors are rewarded and enemies punished; when empires or nations are forged or destroyed; when treaties are signed and boundaries redrawn; and when peace is accepted, troops repatriated, and life begun anew. One large chapter of history ends, and another starts.
 In a very real sense, one society dies— and another is born.
