      <description>Was Seth Rich murdered as an example?
Seth Rich was murdered. Two gunshots to his back. Like you&amp;rsquo;d see on The Sopranos (video). The police called it a robbery. But nothing was stolen. Not his cell phone. Not his wallet. Not his watch. Not his cash.
Shortly after his murder, Wikileaks posted embarrassing emails. Emails from the Democratic National Committee&amp;rsquo;s email server. Wikileaks maintains that the theft of the emails was an inside job.</description>
