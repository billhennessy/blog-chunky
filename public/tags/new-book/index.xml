      <description>My new ebook, Zen Conservatism, will be available for download ($9.50) within the week. To prepare, I’ve posted the first chapter which you can download for free.
Here’s more about the book:
You consider yourself a patriot and a proud American.
You have become more and more concerned about the direction your country is headed.
You wish you could just yell “STOP!” –and someone would listen.
“Zen Conservatism,” was written for you.</description>
