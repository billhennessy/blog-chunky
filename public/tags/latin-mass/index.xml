      <description>I was gladdened to see Bishop Robert Barron&amp;rsquo;s tweets of anger about the Pew survey. Watch the attached video. (You will also be happy to hear the Pew survey didn&amp;rsquo;t shock the bishop.)
I wish, though, his excellency had addressed the real cause of Catholics losing their faith: the ugly and sacrilegious farce that is the Novus Ordo (or Ordinary Form) Mass.
Here&amp;rsquo;s Bishop Barron&amp;rsquo;s initial tweet. I urge you to watch the video attached.</description>

      <description>I prefer the Latin Mass of 1962 (and a thousand years before) for at least 12 reasons listed here. My last reason for loving the Latin Mass (which I failed to list in that blog post) seems important: how American Catholicism has changed since the inception of the new mass in about 1970. So I turned to Georgetown University&amp;rsquo;s Center for Applied Research in the Apostalate for the numbers.
Catholicism is dying in the United States.</description>

      <title>12 Reasons I Love Latin Mass</title>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to Latin Mass instead of the new mass. Latin Mass feels like home to me. It feels like a call to holiness. Every detail of the Latin Mass has meaning, not just to me, but to everyone who&amp;rsquo;s studied scripture. The words, the gestures, the artifacts like the communion rail all have deep meaning. I don&amp;rsquo;t think the new mass is heretical; I just don&amp;rsquo;t think it lifts us up toward God.</description>
