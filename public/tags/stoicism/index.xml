      <description>Governor Eric Greitens resigned. Friend of the lobbyists, Mike Parson, became Missouri&amp;rsquo;s governor. In the words of someone who knows the new governor well, Mike Parson will &amp;ldquo;sell everything that isn&amp;rsquo;t nailed down.&amp;rdquo;
For those of us who believe in limited government that doesn&amp;rsquo;t put its thumb on the scale of achievement, it&amp;rsquo;s time to panic and despair, right?
Wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s never time to panic or despair. And we know this from two of the greatest philosophers of all time, Epictetus and Seneca.</description>

      <title>Free Forever Through Stoicism</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Some things we can control, some we can’t. We can control our attitudes, opinions, goals and desires – choices of our own. We can’t control health, wealth, fame or power – things we can’t have by choosing them.&amp;rdquo; —Epictetus
 Freedom begins with understanding what we control and we do not. Yet very few people even begin to consider this essential dichotomy.
Even in the complete absence of &amp;ldquo;administration&amp;rdquo; as Tocqueville observed in early 19th century America, no one was free who failed to understand Epictetus&amp;rsquo;s control dichotomy: some things are under our control, some are not.</description>
