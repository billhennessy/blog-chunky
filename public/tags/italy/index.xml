UPDATE: Fox News moves fast. From Sky News Service quoting Rafael Abreu Hael of U.S. Geological Survey:
 &amp;ldquo;This is a significant earthquake,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;This is a shallow quake but there is definitely a possibility of damage and even injuries. It is going to depend on what type of buildings are in the area.</description>
