      <description>Today I learned that I am not alone. I am not alone in my anger over a morally-bankrupt attempt to smear a great leader. And I learned that I am not alone in recognizing Eric Greitens&amp;rsquo;s singular ability to inspire and lead.
I also learned that Eric Greitens has some really stupid opponents. Cowardly, stupid weasels. Cowardly because Greitens&amp;rsquo;s opponents funded, produced, and promoted an anonymous video, packed with lies. Stupid because that video so infuriated Missouri&amp;rsquo;s 500,000 military veterans that Greitens is picking up new supporters.</description>
