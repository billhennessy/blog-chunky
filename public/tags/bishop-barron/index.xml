      <description>I was gladdened to see Bishop Robert Barron&amp;rsquo;s tweets of anger about the Pew survey. Watch the attached video. (You will also be happy to hear the Pew survey didn&amp;rsquo;t shock the bishop.)
I wish, though, his excellency had addressed the real cause of Catholics losing their faith: the ugly and sacrilegious farce that is the Novus Ordo (or Ordinary Form) Mass.
Here&amp;rsquo;s Bishop Barron&amp;rsquo;s initial tweet. I urge you to watch the video attached.</description>
