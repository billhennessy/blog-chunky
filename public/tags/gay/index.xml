      <description>Richard Brookhiser called the moment&amp;rsquo;s start, and I called its death. But before we get into that, are you as surprised as I am about Zuckerberg&amp;rsquo;s war on gays?
You would think that a jihadist attack on a gay nightclub would trigger an anti-terror backlash against Islamic terrorists, would you not?
Anti-Gay Jihad Instead, America&amp;rsquo;s radical left has declared a jihad against gays. Leading this jihad is Imam Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook.</description>

      <description>Have you ever seen a moment end?
I watched Duck Dynasty once or twice. I don&amp;rsquo;t get it.
That makes me different. Fourteen million people watch the show every week. That&amp;rsquo;s more than watch any other show on television. Clearly, I&amp;rsquo;m a little odd, especially among conservatives.
That&amp;rsquo;s okay. I&amp;rsquo;m used to being weird.
I never expected that a reality TV show would stop a &amp;ldquo;moment.&amp;rdquo; But that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what&amp;rsquo;s happened.</description>
