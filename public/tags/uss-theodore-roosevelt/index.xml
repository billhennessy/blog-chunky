      <description>Last week, Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly fired the commanding officer of the USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT. I wrote about it here. I supported that decision, but today I am asking President Trump to fire Thomas Modly.
Modley fired Captain Brett Crozier after Crozier&amp;rsquo;s letter to a wide distribution list appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle. That five-page letter asked the Navy to move 4,000 sailors from the USS Roosevelt to hotels in Guam to be isolated to protect them from Coronavirus, which was spreading on board the aircraft carrier.</description>
