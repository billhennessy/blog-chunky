      <description>Excerpt:
. . .
 They say I lack experience. They&amp;rsquo;re right, in a way.
 I have no experience wandering a city for three years trying to find myself. No, I&amp;rsquo;ve never had that luxury. But Barack Obama has.
And I have no experience funneling money from an educational trust into organizations run by my close friend, the convicted terrorist. No experience at all.
Nor do I have the experience of having a political career launched by a pair of terrorists who tried to blow up the Capitol and the Pentagon, who succeeded in killing a police officer.</description>
