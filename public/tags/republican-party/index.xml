      <description>John McCain doesn&amp;rsquo;t want the Republican Party to outlive him.
He&amp;rsquo;s afraid. Afraid that, after he&amp;rsquo;s gone, his political widow will remarry someone younger, sexier, more fun.
Thursday, March 7, 2013: Senate Office Building, Washington, DC In the dark cloisters of his Senate office, McCain leans back in his chair, tie loosened, jacket tossed casually over a guest chair, fingers interlaced behind his white head, and broods.
He sees those rascally young libertarians&amp;ndash;the ones who actually want to own their own lives&amp;ndash;plunging into the party.</description>

      <description>A couple years ago, a lot of folks believed that victory in 2010 would be a cakewalk. Led by Tea Party activists, the GOP picked up over 800 legislative seats, state and federal, in the 2010 off-year election. Rumors of the Republican Party&amp;rsquo;s death had been greatly exaggerated.

Or so it seemed.
Novels and action movies involve a hero&amp;rsquo;s quest. The main character hopes to accomplish something. Dorothy wants to return to Kansas.</description>

      <description>November 7, 2012—When the AP called Florida for Obama only twenty minutes after polls closed there (8:00 EDT), any hopes of a Republican presidential victory were dashed.

And before polls closed in the West, we knew that the GOP had lost the House as well as seven state legislatures.
In short, the Grand Old Party died last night.
Here’s what went wrong.
Wrong Candidate at the Top: When Republicans run the candidate the liberal press wants them to run, they get creamed.</description>

      <description>by Bill Hennessy and Jim Durbin
John Knowles’s classic novel, A Separate Peace, begins memorably:
 I went back to the Devon School not long ago, and found it looking oddly newer than when I was a student there fifteen years before . . . as if a coat of varnish had been put over everything for better preservation.
 I get precisely the opposite feel when I look at the Republican Party.</description>

      <description>John is a Vietnam veteran and retired business executive. He loves America and hates to see what’s happened in Washington the past few years. He believes in liberty and Constitutional limitations on government growth.
He called the Tea Party just to vent and to see if it’s just him.
Recently, John had called Senator Kit Bond’s (R-MO) office in Washington. He wanted to know whether stories that Bond had signed off a $659 million earmark for soy bean farmers were true.</description>
