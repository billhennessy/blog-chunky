 Pope Francis ignored evidence of crimes and overturned punishment imposed by Pope Benedict on the wicked and disgraced Cardinal McCarrick. That&amp;rsquo;s according to a former papal nuncio and corroborated by a former first counselor to the nunciature to the United States speaking on the record. The two men have direct knowledge of the matter.
Pope Francis refused to comment on the allegations that he personally covered up McCarrick&amp;rsquo;s crimes.</description>
