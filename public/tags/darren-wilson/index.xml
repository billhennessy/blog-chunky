      <title>How to Stop the Commies</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s all a lie. It didn&amp;rsquo;t start that way. At first, the Mike Brown protesters were all about Mike Brown and people like him. But not anymore.
Even the New York Times admitted the protests in Mike Brown&amp;rsquo;s name are actually the Revolutionary Communist Party advancing Marxism. (The NYT pulled down the story on Sunday morning. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have linked it, anyway.)
I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of stomping on someone else&amp;rsquo;s parade, even if I disagree with their cause.</description>

      <title>How To Create Hate and Discontent in America</title>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t written about Ferguson because I&amp;rsquo;ve known too little to add value. But ignorance hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped others from stirring up hate and discontent. For example, Missouri&amp;rsquo;s shakedown artist, Lacy Clay.
Lacy Clay, speaking from a private island in the Carribean, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Michael Brown was murdered. Clay knew or should have known the effect of his words: more violence. Either Clay meant to incite violence or he has a casual disregard for the effect of his irresponsible speech.</description>
