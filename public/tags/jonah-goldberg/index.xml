      <description>So many battles are fought in war and in civilian life, and nothing is gained by their victory. Every battle we fight will result in a gain for us or we will not fight . . . There is no great gain in merely being right. To be right about some unimportant subject is not important.
 &amp;ndash;General George S. Patton
Jonah Goldberg explains the problem of Trump better than anyone:</description>

      <description>I hope you read Jonah Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s short article on National Review Online last week. If not, you missed the best definition of Establishment Republicans EVER!
Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s piece also exploded the myth of &amp;ldquo;pro-business&amp;rdquo; way too many conservatives believe. Conservatism isn&amp;rsquo;t pro-business, it&amp;rsquo;s pro-market. I&amp;rsquo;ll let Jonah explain:
 Just to clarify, the difference between being pro-business and pro-market is categorical. A politician who is a “friend of business” is exactly that, a guy who does favors for his friends.</description>

      <description>Clearly a fan of understatement, Ezra Klein once ran a blog called “Not Geniuses.” Now, of course, he demonstrates his ignorance on MSNBC.
Last week, Klein unwittingly advanced the cause of dead constitutions. He did a better job than any proponent could. He said:
 The issue with the Constitution is that the text is confusing because it was written more than a hundred years ago.
 (William F. Buckley once described a statement like Klein’s as evoking of the sort of pity one feels for the ignorance of animals.</description>

      <description>Since A-B sold out to Belgian brewer InBev, things have changed in the St. Louis bar scene.
In a typical St. Louis County strip-mall bar during a Friday happy hour about 70 percent of the male patrons would sit behind an Anheuser-Busch product&amp;ndash;Budweiser, Bud Select, Bud Light, Michelob Ultra, even Busch.
Not anymore.
I stopped drinking Select as soon as the announcement of the buyout came last Sunday. But I was shocked last night when I walked into The Corner Pub &amp;amp; Grill in West St.</description>
