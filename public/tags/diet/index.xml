      <description>Fasting is probably the healthiest thing you can do for yourself. It&amp;rsquo;s also the cheapest healthy thing you can do. Unlike most diets and exercise plans, supplements, and, especially, trips to a doctor, fasting actually saves money. When you fast, you don&amp;rsquo;t eat.
Further, fasting is the simplest thing you can do to improve your physical and mental health. There are only two things to remember:
 Don&amp;rsquo;t eat. Drink some water.</description>

      <description>Do you follow the recommended diets? Low fat. High carbohydrate? Eat lots of fruit?
If so, you&amp;rsquo;re probably overweight. And your blood tests are probably a mess. Maybe your doctor recommends expensive prescriptions to lower your cholesterol.
A new study finds the problem is not your fault. Your doctor, poorly educated in nutrition, and government recommendations, prompted by industry lobbyists, are designed to keep you fat and sick. And it&amp;rsquo;s not just US government.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re overweight, have high cholesterol, diabetes, Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s, Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s, heart disease, or cancer, it&amp;rsquo;s probably not your fault. You&amp;rsquo;ve been told to eat poison your whole life, by people who are supposed to know better. Here&amp;rsquo;s some truth to set you free.
Actually, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why. But it&amp;rsquo;s happening to you and millions of other people. Doctors are killing their patients. And they&amp;rsquo;re getting a lot of help from the government and big agriculture.</description>
