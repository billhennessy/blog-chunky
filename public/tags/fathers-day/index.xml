      <description>A new poll shows American’s are stressed out. Almost half of Americans say they’re under moderate to severe financial stress.
I feel it, too. Financially, emotionally, and chronologically.
While my book Zen Conservatism won’t fix all your problems, it will help you deal with what’s going on in America a little better.
From now until Father’s Day, I’m giving you $4.95 off the cover price, so you can get the book for just $10 plus shipping.</description>
