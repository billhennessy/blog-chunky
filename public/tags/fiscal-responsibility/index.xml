      <description>Roy Blunt has not given an inch in thebattle over the debt ceiling. He deserves high praise for his resolve.
During the 2010 Republican primary, many on the right questioned Blunt&amp;rsquo;s fiscal conservative credentials. As a member of the House, Blunt had helped craft some and pass unpopular spending bills, including TARP. On theissue of debt and responsibility, though, he shows no sign of cracking.
Government debt is the defining issue of our time, perhaps of the American experiment.</description>
