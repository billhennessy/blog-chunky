      <description>John is a Vietnam veteran and retired business executive. He loves America and hates to see what’s happened in Washington the past few years. He believes in liberty and Constitutional limitations on government growth.
He called the Tea Party just to vent and to see if it’s just him.
Recently, John had called Senator Kit Bond’s (R-MO) office in Washington. He wanted to know whether stories that Bond had signed off a $659 million earmark for soy bean farmers were true.</description>

      <description>In the battle between conservatives and statists, a fundamental difference seems to lie in the meaning of a concept found in the Declaration of Independence:
 Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed[.]
 The dispute is how men convey consensual powers to their government.
Conservatives believe that governmental power is conveyed exclusively through the Constitution; statists believe power is conveyed through elections.</description>

      <title>Days of Free Markets Numbered</title>

      <description>The statists are moving faster through the Constitution than Hitler moved through France. Today, Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to advance a bill to socialize medicine without debate.
 House Democrats went on record again in favor of advancing the legislation while allowing only limited debate, which would hobble the ability of Republicans to wrest concessions on one of Obama&amp;rsquo;s top domestic priorities.

      <description>This is my last post on Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View, at least for some time. My work for the St. Louis Tea Party movement is very important to me and, in my opinion, to you. Our government is moving quickly to obliterate all vestiges of the free market republic that America once was. With the Republican party in disarray and the Democrat party in the hands of statist despots, the tea partiers are the only thing standing between liberty and tyranny.</description>

      <description>Just watch. And laugh. Then call KTVI&amp;rsquo;s General Manager, Spencer Koch at 314-213-2222, and demand an apology for Sgt. Bilko&amp;rsquo;s latest travesty reported on Gateway Pundit.

Too good to be true? Ask Charles: cjaco@charlesjaco.com.
On April 13, Charles Jaco reported on KTVI News that an organization called The Constitution Party sponsored and helped organize the St. Louis Tea Party. Jaco also claimed that The Constitution Party is a white supremacist group.</description>

      <title>Fox 2 News St. Louis Lies About Tea Parties **UPDATE**</title>

      <description>Charles Jaco of Fox 2 News in St. Louis filed a fabricated story claiming that a) the St. Louis Tea Party is organized by something called The Constitution Party, and b) the Constitution Party is an extremist, white supremacist group.
I will say only this:
   Neither Dana Loesch nor I is a member of the Constitution Party. I did not know of such an organization before April 14, 2009</description>

Accompanying message from Lloyd Marcus:
 Hello, it&amp;rsquo;s Lloyd Marcus, one of the spokespersons for the Our Country Deserves Better Committee. I&amp;rsquo;m active with this organization because I believe that Conservatism is compassionate and is the true path to achieving the AmericanDream. Liberalism weakens the human spirit by encouraging people to view themselves as victims.
 Besides political activism, my other great passion in life is as a singer, because that&amp;rsquo;s one of the things God gave me the greatest passion to pursue.</description>

Barack Obama is now less popular than George W. Bush at the same point in their respective presidencies according to Rasmussen.
The poll also indicates that deficits are more important to Americans than anything else. This could be the result of theTea Party movement which drew more than 30,000 people in 40 cities to take to the streets over the weekend.
At this rate, Obama&amp;rsquo;s overall popularity will turn net negative this time next week.</description>

      <description>Dangerous Thoughts Standing in the Wings
_Why are you here? _I thought.
I was standing on the steps of the Arch fully aware that my fingers were painfully cold when the wrong thought crossed my mind. By &amp;ldquo;wrong thought,&amp;rdquo; I mean that one thought that will subconsciously sabotage the important or dangerous thing you are about to attempt. Like thinking, &amp;ldquo;what if the front wheel just fell off?&amp;rdquo; as you&amp;rsquo;re cruising down a winding road on a motorcycle, or &amp;ldquo;what if I forget my lines?</description>

      <description>Thanks to the 1,000+ patriots who stood in the snow at the Arch, Dana &amp;ldquo;The Energizer&amp;rdquo; Loesch, Doug Saur, the speakers, Michelle Moore and Jeff who managed the fairgrounds, Desiree&amp;rsquo; the Poster Party Lady, and the true leaders at #TCOT who held my hand after I stumbled into this event. Today at the Arch in St. Louis was simple patriotic magic. I have to do some wrapping up of the event, but I&amp;rsquo;ll say this:</description>

      <description>My light blogging owes to our efforts to change the world in a week. My role is, appropriately, miniscule.
When Congress listens, it will repeal the trillions of waste, fraud, and abuse it has produced over the past 4 months, it will stop proposed borrowing and bailouts, it will stop rewarding bad behavior in corporations and citizens, or it will retire. This time, there are no two ways.
 Using tools like Twitter, email, and Facebook, TCOT has provided at least 163 patriots a forum to voice its discontent on Friday, February 27 at 11:00 a.</description>

      <description>Great coverage of the St. Louis Tea Party on KMOV Channel 4 by reporter Matt Sczesny. Channel 4 has not posted the video (that I can find). I&amp;rsquo;ll link or embed it as soon as it&amp;rsquo;s available.
Please say &amp;ldquo;thanks&amp;rdquo; to Matt and KMOV for a fair report.
 Amy at Top Conservatives on Twitter has put together a convenient list of the Tea Parties across the country. This list is NOT exhaustive, as not all cities have a Facebook Event page.</description>

      <description>Go Dana. How &amp;lsquo;bout a little equal time? Why does the WU prof get 80 percent of the time?
DELETED VIDEO EMBED
I detest videos that start automatically. You can see the report on KSDK&amp;rsquo;s web site. Not the best coverage, certainly not fair, but publicity is publicity. So thanks to Rebecca for visiting with Dana and selecting 7 seconds of the interview to air ahead of 30 minutes of some college professor who wrote a book in his spare time.</description>

      <description>The future is ours. Your disgust with the borrowing and spending, your noble desire to restore the republic the founders wrought, those are the real protests. The tea party is in our hearts and souls&amp;ndash;the events are just the physical manifestations. But now, the President:
Ninety percent of live blog posts suck. So I did my blog readers a big favor: I tested my quips on Twitter. Here I present my instant reactions that were good enough to get retweeted.</description>

      <title>Uncle Barry’s Adding Machine Stimulator Regulation Gimmick</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago, shortly after his inauguration, Barry “The President” Obama panicked: the Republicans might talk the people out of the stimulus bill.
Barry moved quickly. But Barry is an organizer, not an engineer. He’s the cheerleader, not the quarterback. He moves mobs, not nations. And when panicked, he fell apart.
Barry decided to announce that life as we know it would economically end the Day After The Stimulus Bill Is Defeated.</description>
