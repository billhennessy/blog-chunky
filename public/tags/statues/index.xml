      <description>You probably believe the narrative. Because that narrative is strong right now. It has become common knowledge. Common knowledge in the formal, game theory sense of the word.
In game theory, common knowledge is something everyone knows everyone knows. And everyone know everyone knows. And everyone knows how everyone else will behave because of that knowledge.
Common knowledge doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be true. In a common knowledge game, truth doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.</description>
