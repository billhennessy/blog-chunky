      <description>A few Mizzou football players announced they&amp;rsquo;re boycotting all sports activities until University of Missouri system president Tim Wolfe quits or is fired. Considering the football team&amp;rsquo;s dismal performance, the cynic in me wonders if sitting out might help the players&amp;rsquo; chances of getting an NFL draft.
The players and other African-American students at Mizzou believe they are victims of &amp;ldquo;systematic oppression&amp;rdquo; and they want Tim Wolfe to fix it simply by resigning.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.&amp;rdquo;
 &amp;ndash;President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Farewell Address, 1961
A young man named Adam Weinstein recently called for incarceration of disbelievers in the cult of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming (CAGW). His argument mirrors the argument Goebbels used in 1930s to quash dissent from eugenics and to take immediate policy actions for the betterment of humanity.</description>
