      <description>Beyond Top Secret.
Hillary famously kept an email server in her private bedroom where it was safe from being used as Bill&amp;rsquo;s YouPorn hub. (I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure Bill Clinton hasn&amp;rsquo;t visited the inside of his wife&amp;rsquo;s sleeping chamber in the 21st century.)
Being plugged into the internet, though, and lacking even the most rudimentary security, Hillary&amp;rsquo;s server was exposed to the prying eyes of Chinese, North Korean, Russian, and Anonymous spies.</description>

      <description>Note: This is a flight of fantasy. If anything in this post is later shown to conform reality, it’s pure coincidence. Nor am I accusing Gen. Petraeus of any crime or of compromising of national security secrets. (Just enjoy it, will ya?) A sex scandal rocks the king of spies.
An email chain unravels the Pentagon high command.
A cover-up exposed.
It&amp;rsquo;s like the back cover of a Nelson DeMille novel.</description>
