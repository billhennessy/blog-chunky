      <description>This is disturbing. A St. Louis area “Christian” church, Parkway United Church of Christ, on N. Ballas is promoting Islam on its sign.

This photo was snapped today, June 7, 2010 by Marcia Behr of St. Louis.
While it’s understandable that a Christian church would treat Muslims as children of God, we are obliged to do so in the context of their prayerful conversion to Christ. Tolerance does not require submission.</description>
