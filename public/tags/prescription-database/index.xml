      <description>Angry texts.
I got a bunch of very angry texts this morning.
My friends are fired up. Because of Governor Greitens&amp;rsquo;s executive order. **An executive order that implements a novel approach to prescription drug databases. **
In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, Governor Greitens signed an executive order on July 17. The EO made Missouri the 50th state to establish some sort of prescription drug tracking.
Most states track everything about prescriptions.</description>

      <description>Missouri is the only state that doesn&amp;rsquo;t track your medical prescriptions.
People say it like it&amp;rsquo;s a bad thing.
What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with the government not knowing that one bit of information about your private medical life? Can&amp;rsquo;t government keep out of at least this one, extremely personal matter?
The do-gooders and busy-bodies want Missouri to maintain a database (tied into similar databases in all other states) that keeps a permanent record of every prescription a doctor or dentist writes.</description>
