      <description>Your FICO score is a number between 380 and 820 (or something like that) that banks use to determine your credit worthiness. The higher your FICO score, the better.
But that’s not what I’m talking about here.
I’m talking about your FICA score.

Your FICA score is the minimum payment on your federal loan.
You didn’t know you had a federal loan? You do.
If you’re 18 years old, you owe the federal government about $46,000.</description>
