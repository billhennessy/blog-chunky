      <description>I am very honored by the invitations I get to speak to various clubs and organizations around Greater St. Louis, including Illinois. This August, I have the chance to meet two groups and to guest host a radio show.
On August 18, I’ll speak to the Meramec Township Republican Committee.
On August 26, I’ll be speaking at the North County Republican Club meeting at Yac’s Restaurant at 407 Dunn Rd. in Florissant.</description>
