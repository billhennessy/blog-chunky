      <description>You might have thought I was paranoid for wondering if some people in the CIA and the Deep State are plotting a coup to overturn our recent election.
The Wall Street Journal seems to agree with my conclusion: a coup attempt is going on in America. Rogue actors within the CIA, all of the major leftist media (New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS), and probably major defense contractors seem to be involved, though the Wall Street Journal stops short of accusing advertisers.</description>

Good for the military, which acted on a Supreme Court order. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope the SCOTUS will have the berries to shut down TheOne&amp;rsquo;s continuing slide into despotism.</description>
