      <description>Even his supporters say President Trump&amp;rsquo;s speech is sometimes inelegant. Intentional or accidental, the president&amp;rsquo;s word choice often triggers his enemies and sometimes confuses his many supporters. But on Friday President Trump had the best words for sure.
Talking about the possibility of Democrats seizing control of the US House of Representatives, he said, &amp;ldquo;could happen . . . could happen.&amp;rdquo;
But the killer line we all must remember came next: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it.</description>

      <description>You probably never thought you&amp;rsquo;d see anything like this, but it just happened.
What&amp;rsquo;s it like when a nation turns from strife to peace and healing?
Watch this most amazing moment in politics, in history. You might find yourself tearing up when the Bishop wraps The Donald in a prayer shawl. Powerful.

In my remarks to the 500 people at the Tea Party for Trump at Surdyke Harley-Davidson in Festus last Sunday, I spoke about the need for healing in America.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, ISIS is on a roll.
What a week! Nearly 200 murders across three countries on two continents. Not bad for a JV team, huh? Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the week:
** Istanbul Airport: 45 murdered, 52 hospitalized. ** Bangladesh Bakery: 20 murdered, 13 escaped.</description>
