      <title>Perfect Words from Trump</title>

      <description>Even his supporters say President Trump&amp;rsquo;s speech is sometimes inelegant. Intentional or accidental, the president&amp;rsquo;s word choice often triggers his enemies and sometimes confuses his many supporters. But on Friday President Trump had the best words for sure.
Talking about the possibility of Democrats seizing control of the US House of Representatives, he said, &amp;ldquo;could happen . . . could happen.&amp;rdquo;
But the killer line we all must remember came next: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it.</description>

      <description>When you hide the name and simply list accomplishments, any reasonable person would agree that Donald Trump has done more good for the country than any president in living memory.
Economy ** African-America unemployment lowest in history ** Hispanic unemployment lowest in history ** Female unemployment lowest in 18 years ** Stock market up 35% since *election
** Manufacturing jobs growing for *first time in decades ** Steelworkers going to back to work after humiliating layoffs ** Regulatory cuts have reinvigorated dying industries ** Millions of new jobs planned across the country</description>

President Trump wins praise from all side for his strength, dignity, and leadership following the left&amp;rsquo;s rifle attack on Republican members of Congress.

      <description>You probably never thought you&amp;rsquo;d see anything like this, but it just happened.
What&amp;rsquo;s it like when a nation turns from strife to peace and healing?
Watch this most amazing moment in politics, in history. You might find yourself tearing up when the Bishop wraps The Donald in a prayer shawl. Powerful.

In my remarks to the 500 people at the Tea Party for Trump at Surdyke Harley-Davidson in Festus last Sunday, I spoke about the need for healing in America.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re football team, you&amp;rsquo;re measured by games won. If you&amp;rsquo;re a computer company, you&amp;rsquo;re measured by products shipped. If you&amp;rsquo;re and international terrorist organization, you&amp;rsquo;re measured by mayhem created.
Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, ISIS is on a roll.
What a week! Nearly 200 murders across three countries on two continents. Not bad for a JV team, huh? Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the week:
** Istanbul Airport: 45 murdered, 52 hospitalized. ** Bangladesh Bakery: 20 murdered, 13 escaped.</description>

      <description>Think about the word &amp;ldquo;news.&amp;rdquo; In a moment, I&amp;rsquo;m going to ask you more questions about the news. Before that, though, you probably heard about the terrible terrorist attack in Istanbul, Turkey. Dozens killed, scores injured. &amp;ldquo;It was like hell,&amp;rdquo; one witness recalled.
Where did you get news of this latest terrorist attack? Facebook? Television? Radio?
Do you remember what you were doing when you heard the news? Take a moment to think back to when you first heard the news.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s outstanding,&amp;rdquo; said the Great One.
 The Republican leadership in Congress doesn’t have the guts to go to the floor of the Senate or the floor of the House and make these charges. This is outstanding. You can’t let Hillary Clinton get away with her corruption, her cronyism, her criminality. I don’t care who you support or don’t support. She’s detestable.

      <description>Say what you want about Donald Trump, the customer service at his properties is insanely great. And The Donald personally sets the standard for that service. He also inspects it, and he has a sick level of attention to detail. Donald Trump doesn&amp;rsquo;t miss a thing when it comes to providing a perfect environment for his guests and residents.
The opposite is true of the TSA. Like most government-run operations, the TSA sucks at customer service.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed a lot of people are saying &amp;ldquo;President Trump&amp;rdquo; lately. And reading &amp;ldquo;President Trump&amp;rdquo; online, haven&amp;rsquo;t you?
If not, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably notice it later today or tomorrow.
[Tweet &amp;ldquo;Catch yourself saying &amp;lsquo;President Trump&amp;rsquo; now? @realDonaldTrump&amp;rdquo;]
It&amp;rsquo;s common during election years for pundits to occasionally say &amp;ldquo;President So-and-so,&amp;rdquo; usually sarcastically. And some &amp;ldquo;President Trump&amp;rdquo; talk is sarcastic. But most of this President Trump talk is subconscious prediction. People think President Trump is a thing, so their brains are warming up.</description>

      <title>Who Is Conservative?</title>

      <description>People think they&amp;rsquo;re rational, but we&amp;rsquo;re not. For example, on many issues,** Trump&amp;rsquo;s positions are almost identical to Ronald Reagan&amp;rsquo;s.** When it comes to abortion, trade, taxes, foreign policy and the military, and entitlements like Social Security, you can&amp;rsquo;t fit a dime between Reagan and Trump.
So why do people see Trump as far to the left of Reagan?
Contrasts and comparisons.
Reagan ran against George Bush and John B. Anderson.</description>

      <description>I have no idea who will win the Indiana primary 72 hours from the time I write. But the people inside Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s campaign seem to have an idea. And it&amp;rsquo;s not good for them. Cruz&amp;rsquo;s top team expects their candidate to lose. And Senator Cruz seems to have accepted that outcome.
Expectations Matter More Than Preferences Regular readers know that polls that ask &amp;ldquo;who do you think will win&amp;rdquo; trump polls that ask &amp;ldquo;who do you intend to vote for&amp;rdquo; or even &amp;ldquo;who did you vote for?</description>

      <title>Government Censors Health Information. Collusion! Rigged!</title>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably found yourself saying words like &amp;ldquo;rigged&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;collusion&amp;rdquo; recently. They&amp;rsquo;ve become sexy words, haven&amp;rsquo;t they. That&amp;rsquo;s because Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s made rigged and collusion household words. He&amp;rsquo;s put them in your head.
You might even use them wrong. &amp;ldquo;There was a collusion on highway forty-four.&amp;rdquo; Or &amp;ldquo;I rigged my shorts.&amp;rdquo; (BTW, Hillary sounds weak and hoarse, doesn&amp;rsquo;t she? Grating.)
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed yourself saying rigged and collusion, pay attention tomorrow.</description>

      <description>I was a pretender.
In 2012, I pretended I believed Mitt Romney would win. But I knew better. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the heart to tell the truth to the volunteers banging doors and working call lists from our election office in South County.
But I knew Romney would lose. I suspected the GOP would not regain the Senate.
When some of our hardest workers showed up to help break down the office and move our belongings, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t look at them.</description>

      <description>Glenn Beck was pretty sure that God killed Antonin Scalia so Ted Cruz would win the presidency.
Glenn Beck&amp;rsquo;s theology is very different from mine.
In 2010, I worried that Glenn Beck was doing more harm than good. For days, I&amp;rsquo;d watched Beck tell his watchers that the world was ending and they would be crushed. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I wrote:
 Beck offers no solutions. At least, he hasn’t in the past two days.</description>

      <description>Ted Cruz has a powerful strategy available to him. This strategy could not only determine the winner of the Republican convention but put Cruz in position to influence policy for generations.
But it&amp;rsquo;s probably not what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to lay out some assumptions, many of which you could disagree with. That&amp;rsquo;s okay. But for the purposes of this post, let&amp;rsquo;s stipulate:
*1. Ted Cruz believes, like Glenn Beck, that Donald Trump would make a worse president than Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, or Bernie Sanders.</description>

      <description>Who would have thought that Pat Buchanan would become the spokesman for Generation X?
I put a lot of stock into generational history. I am a big fan of Howe and Strauss, a pair of historians whose works include Generations: The History of America&amp;rsquo;s Future, 13ers: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?, Millennials Rising, and, my favorite, The Fourth Turning.
As someone born in the 13th generation of Americans, more commonly called Generation X after the book by Douglas Coupland, I am overly captivated by that generation.</description>

      <description>Leverage: don’t make deals without it.
 &amp;ndash;Donald Trump, The Art of the Deal, 1987
It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to go Machiavellian during primaries. Even during general elections after primaries. But there&amp;rsquo;s a great danger for the grassroots.
**If we don&amp;rsquo;t hold candidates accountable during the race when we have all the leverage, how can we possibly hold office-holders accountable? **
Check out this paragraph from the Washington Post:
   Cruz offered a lawyerly defense of his campaign’s actions, blaming media reporting for the mistake.</description>

      <description>The polls were wrong. But that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the biggest shock.
The big shock was . . . who was that guy pretending to be Donald Trump?
Millions and millions of people waited to watch The Donald melt down after finishing second behind Ted Cruz.
But it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. Instead, Trump managed to show humility and graciousness without giving up his signature bravado. Pretty brilliant. As Romney and Rove learned in 2012, though, air power will not win many races.</description>

      <description>This &amp;ldquo;VOTING VIOLATION&amp;rdquo; controversy says bad things about the Cruz campaign.
(BTW, Rubio&amp;rsquo;s campaign sent a similar, but less creepy, mailer, too. So far, I have not seen a large number of complaints about the Rubio mailer.)
And I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the ethics of publicly shaming people who vote sporadically. I&amp;rsquo;m talking two gross electioneering violations from a campaign that markets itself as the most scientifically advanced in history. With the mailer Team Cruz showed a lack of strategic understanding of the science and compounded their ignorance by apparently making up numbers.</description>

 &amp;ndash;Thomas Jefferson to William Short, 1825.
National Review has entered dangerous territory: they have inadvertently made the case for Trump.
An angry screed by Kevin Williamson titled &amp;ldquo;Our Post-Literate Politics&amp;rdquo; (later renamed to &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s a Book?&amp;quot;) makes the case that Trump supporters are illiterate, uneducated, dim-witted, racist, homophobes.

      <description>Reading two excellent articles by Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight (here and here), I remembered a thought that passed through my mind last Friday.
After reading some of National Review&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Against Trump&amp;rdquo; issue,I wrote blog post. To me the NR issue showed the magazine is out of touch with voters.

      <title>How late-deciders are like fish</title>

      <description>**Expectations matter most in how undecided voters decide. **
It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand how late-deciders tend to vote. This knowledge (especially in Iowa and New Hampshire) could decide the outcome.
Primary voters tend to decide whom to for at the last minute.
In 2008, 16 percent of voters said they made their choice on election day. Which means we have a long way to go to know how Iowa will turn out.</description>

I agree with Ted Cruz. And welcome Big Government readers.
Senator Cruz said, &amp;ldquo;Katrina Pierson is an utterly fearless principled conservative.&amp;rdquo;
That was just two years ago. Katrina Pierson was challenging Pete Sessions for Congress.
I also agree with Ted&amp;rsquo;s dad, Rafael Cruz, who said of Katrina, &amp;ldquo;She’s a strict constitutionalist.</description>

      <description>When I was a kid (thought I felt kind of old at the time) disaster movies were the thing.
Before Star Wars, the 1970s were about killer sharks, towering infernos, earthquakes, and capsized cruise ships.
Psychologists and sociologists attributed the genre&amp;rsquo;s popularity to the people&amp;rsquo;s need to assimilate nuclear holocaust.
I think the movies were just good, cathartic entertainment.

      <description>On New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve, male Muslim refugees rampaged across Europe.
They didn&amp;rsquo;t use guns and bombs. They used their bodies. On women.
This created a political-correctness nightmare for Europe&amp;rsquo;s leaders. On the one hand, the victims were women, and no means no, and we must always believe a woman who accuses a man of sexual predation (unless the man is Bill Clinton in which case we destroy the woman).
On the other hand, the assailants .</description>

      <description>Five for five.
The first five people who told me they supported Trump in 2015 also supported Ross Perot in 1992.
I realize it&amp;rsquo;s a tiny sample size. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that Donald Trump is the reincarnation of H. Ross Perot. Conservatives&amp;ndash;all conservatives and all center-right voters&amp;ndash;need to come to terms with that fact. We must also deal with the realities of the 2016 election and choose a strategy.</description>

      <description>“I’ll build a wall . . . and I’ll make Donald Trump pay for it.” — Ted Cruz
Line of the night in the last GOP Presidential debate of the year of our Lord two thousand and fifteen.
This was the most telling debate of all. And it shouldn’t have happened.
The more you know about anything, the less you like it. That’s a scientific fact.

Considering the football team&amp;rsquo;s dismal performance, the cynic in me wonders if sitting out might help the players&amp;rsquo; chances of getting an NFL draft.
The players and other African-American students at Mizzou believe they are victims of &amp;ldquo;systematic oppression&amp;rdquo; and they want Tim Wolfe to fix it simply by resigning.</description>

      <description>When Jim Cramer asks a question, you know everything&amp;rsquo;s all boogered up.
The first hour of the GOP Presidential Debate from Colorado will go down as the first official event of the post-journalism world. The debate ended with John Harwood lying about the debate&amp;rsquo;s length. Having been an occasional guest of Larry Kudlow, I&amp;rsquo;m being nice. But the CNBC reporters couldn&amp;rsquo;t write a story for my high school newspaper.
On the substance of what the candidates said, this was the best debate so far.</description>

I hear she&amp;rsquo;s losing a lot of support from Democrat Party insiders, at least in private. The DNC is meeting this week, and talk will likely surround an alternative Democrats can vote for.
While Republicans enjoy the Clinton meltdown, we might want to be careful what we wish for.
One of the GOP&amp;rsquo;s best hopes for the White House is voter enthusiasm. Republicans can&amp;rsquo;t wait to vote, Democrats dread it.</description>

      <description>A couple weeks ago, I published a simple game for political nerds. Assuming the next president must build a cabinet from current candidates for the Republican nomination for president, how would you assign candidates to cabinet positions.
This was meant to be a fun exercise for people who spend too much time thinking about politics. Like the leaders-eat-last poll, this required hide, often dissatisfying choices. As a result, only six people completed the exercise which took up to a half hour.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s sad that Donald Trump has inspired so many good conservatives to promote fantasies about the 14th Amendment.
The Supreme Court addressed the issue of birthright citizenship directly, and Mark Levin and Laura Ingram know it. They are Constitutional lawyers.
Both Levin and Ingraham are familiar with United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) which established, thoroughly, that citizenship by birth has been the law of the land since before the Declaration of Independence and was codified by the 14th Amendment.</description>

Last week&amp;rsquo;s poll asked you to watch a video by Simon Sinek before answering two, simple, two-part questions: which Republican candidate for President and Missouri Governor is most likely and least likely to eat last?
I intended the poll to be hard. Not complicated, not long, but emotionally challenging.

In business, you command the price play by being very, very big and very, very efficient. In presidential politics, you&amp;rsquo;re unique or you close up shop and go home. Commodities don&amp;rsquo;t win executive offices. Usually.

That simple insight inspired the title of Simon Sinek&amp;rsquo;s latest book, &amp;ldquo;Leaders Eat Last.&amp;rdquo; If I could influence high school or college curricula, no one would graduate without successfully completing a semester course on that principle.
Below is another remarkable video of Simon Sinek discussing how circumstances can override our desire to lead and serve and how leadership and service can fix almost any problem. But first, I&amp;rsquo;d like you think a bit more about these two critical needs: leadership and service.</description>

Great question. History being what it is, we can&amp;rsquo;t spread them across time, only across government. So this week&amp;rsquo;s poll is a little fun.
The rules:
You must fill the next White House cabinet using only the current candidates for President. You do not know who the President or Vice President is, so assume it&amp;rsquo;s none of the current candidates.</description>

Over 24 million people watched the first Republican debate Thursday. That&amp;rsquo;s the largest audience ever for a cable program, save for sports.
Everybody knows why so many watched: people wanted to see a fight break out between Chris Christie and Rand Paul.
Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s presence probably didn&amp;rsquo;t hurt. Let me clarify that. Trump&amp;rsquo;s appearance helped rating. His performance might have ended his campaign.
Donald Trump comported himself with all the dignity and gravitas of a George W.</description>

      <description>Last week&amp;rsquo;s poll asked for your degree of support for Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s candidacy. This poll received far less attention than the Missouri GOP Governor poll of the previous week, as only 60 people responded.
On the plus side, there was no detectable cheating on the Trump poll.

      <description>Last week, I launched anonline poll of declared and likely candidates for governor.
This was not a controlled survey, so be careful what you read into it. Instead of using the poll as a measure of breadth, I recommend looking at from a few other angles.
Suspicious Voting Yes, there was a lot of suspicious voting. At least one candidate received his or her strongest support from a single data center in India.</description>

      <description>Donald Trump is back in the news. This time for attacking John McCain&amp;rsquo;s service record. But he&amp;rsquo;s dominating the polls.
Given what you know of Donald Trump, rate your own support for Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s candidacy for president on a scale of 0 to 5 with 0 meaning &amp;ldquo;no support&amp;rdquo; and 5 meaning &amp;ldquo;full support.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Could it be?
Am I reading this right?
Has anyone ever surprised you with a wish? A wish that defied logic?
Yesterday, a friend wrote of his concerns about Eric Greitens, the Navy SEAL, humanitarian, Rhodes Scholar, charity founder, and former boxer who’s considering a run for Missouri Governor.
His concern began: “Most all GOP candidates proudly trumpet their positions . . . “
He was right, of course. Almost.</description>

      <description>The will of man is not shattered, but softened, bent, and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy, but it prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, but it compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.</description>

      <description>I am embarrassed.
I am embarrassed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about this problem sooner. Or I heard about it and ignored it, which is even worse. Maybe I thought it was just the usual liberal whining about trumped up racial problems. Whatever, I should have listened.
On September 2, I asked a room of about 30 tea partiers, &amp;ldquo;Do you trust our justice system?&amp;rdquo; I heard a chorus of &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not being judgmental or rhetorical with that title. I&amp;rsquo;m curious how other people deal with capital punishment.
Here&amp;rsquo; my story:
Once upon a time, I advocated for the death penalty. Loudly. Shrilly, at times.
In the 1980s and into 1990s, I read a lot. Philosophical. Religious. Legal. Historical. Lots of angles, but few perspectives. You see, I sought out confirming information. I searched high and low for perspectives that would justify my own.</description>

      <description>UPDATE:
Welcome, Donald Trump fans! Thanks for reading.
Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s true, I have had disagreements with Erick in the past. I try to assess the situation, not just the person. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to disagree with someone on one subject and to agree with them on another.
If anything, Erick showed consistency by rescinding Trump&amp;rsquo;s invitation to Red State. Erick didn&amp;rsquo;t want the event to descend into chaos led by my friends over the Barbour episode; he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want a descent into chaos led by Donald Trump.</description>

      <description>. . . What Your Definition of Terrorism Is I heard a lot of people giving their opinions of what constitutes “terrorism.” Here’s the United States Code:
 Definitions &amp;hellip; the term &amp;lsquo;terrorism&amp;rsquo; means premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents;
 Let’s stick with that one. To be terrorism, all of these five elements must be present. You can use it as a checklist:</description>

      <description>A man wants his wife to get breast implants. His wife doesn’t want it.
They compromise, and she gets one implant.
Is this the best outcome?
No! It’s the worst possible outcome. Either of the two other outcomes—no implants or two—would be better than the compromise.
So why are Americans so infatuated with political compromise that leaves the country more lopsided?
Why Compromise Produce the Worst Outcome The FBI’s top hostage negotiator provided my example, via Eric Barker’s fabulous blog, Barking Up The Wrong Tree.</description>

To what and whom do we owe loyalty, and how should we express it?
Generational historians William Strauss and Neil Howe describe a generation of &amp;ldquo;nomads&amp;rdquo; in their prophetic book The Fourth Turning.
 &amp;ldquo;The 13th Generation (Nomad, born 1961-1981) survived a hurried childhood of divorce, latchkeys, open classrooms, devil-child movies, and a shift from G to R ratings. They came of age curtailing the earlier rise in youth crime and fall in test scores—yet heard themselves denounced as so wild and stupid as to put The Nation at Risk.</description>

      <description>There are two kinds of people in America: those who grow up to become productive adults, and those who become bureaucrats.
The GSA scandal lit up the 3 Stooges mentality of the &amp;ldquo;men and women&amp;rdquo; who would run every aspect of your life if Obama and his czars get their way.

      <description>Scrooge’s nephew left the office and let in two men in the process. They came to ask for a donation for London’s poor.
 &amp;ldquo;At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,&amp;rdquo; said the gentleman, taking up a pen, &amp;ldquo;it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.</description>

      <description>I live in a very hilly area. Yet I’m still alive. Explain that.
Maybe that’s why I’m a lower-case “r” republican and not an upper-case one.
Republicans seem to feel every hill is worth dying on.
What else could explain the House’s rejection of a silly payroll tax cut extension followed by a doubly-damaging capitulation?
By “silly,” I mean ill-advised, inconsequential, irrational, and fiscally irresponsible. The Senate’s two-month extension of the Social Security tax cut represents the worst of Washington.</description>

      <description>If the Tea Party—or ACORN or the Democratic National Committee or anyone or anything else, for that matter—stays in a perpetual state of heightened negative emotions nothing positive gets accomplished.
The gazelle that flees imaginary lions soon dies of exhaustion. As positive emotions researcher Barbara Frederickson puts it:
 when extreme, prolonged, or contextually inappropriate, negative emotions can trigger a wide array of problems for individuals and for society.
 Phobias develop out of unchecked fear.</description>

      <description>_**&amp;ldquo;For over a thousand years Roman conquerors returning from the wars enjoyed the honor of triumph, a tumultuous parade. In the procession came trumpeteers, musicians and strange animals from conquered territories, together with carts laden with treasure and captured armaments. The conquerors rode in a triumphal chariot, the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him. Sometimes his children robed in white stood with him in the chariot or rode the trace horses.</description>

By an overwhelming, unmistakable 71 percent, we said to the Obama Regime, “Take this bill and shove it.”
The overwhelming passage was a slap in the face to the Missouri Hospital Association and to BJC President Steven Lipstein who spent nearly $500,000 trying to convince their employees that the hospital chain profits trump the Constitution.</description>

      <description>For the record, I do not apologize for focusing on the most important battles facing self-government since the American Revolution.

Earlier this week, McGraw Milhaven of 550 KTRS criticized Tea Partyers for not opposing Missouri legislation, introduced by and championed by Republicans, that will force insurance companies to cover treatment for children diagnosed with Autism and associated conditions. (I personally oppose this legislation, by the way.)
Before that, a few Tea Partyers criticized me and others on facebook for not doing “enough” to support the Missouri Healthcare Free Choice act, which recently passed both the House and the Senate.</description>

      <description>Last week, a colleague commented that he only put credence into international polls. As if the poll gods were listening, today ABC News released the most affirming poll for President Bush&amp;rsquo;s Iraq strategy ever conducted.
It must have pained the ABC News editors to write such a glowing headline:

So pained, in fact, that they felt compelled to immediately qualify that statement:
