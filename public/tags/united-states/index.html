                When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for conservatives to divorce themselves from superstitions they’ve embraced since the Progressive Movement of the 1920s and join the pantheon of reasonable people, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
I hold these truths to be totally friggin’ obvious, that all drugs are not created equal, that we’ve wasted billions of dollars and millions of lives pursuing a** demented “zero tolerance” temperance goal that was Never Going To Happen**, that the losses we’ve endured trying stamp out weed have cost American society more than they&amp;rsquo;ve gained, that among these losses are lives, money, and opportunity.

                **UPDATE Union Declares Victory AsHostess Goes Out of Business. No more Ho Hos. ****
Unions destroy themselves like pathetic drunks, dragging down everyone around them.

In a fine example of anti-strategic thinking and un-game theory, the Bakers Union put 637 of its members out of work yesterday.
Hostess—makers of Twinkies—is bankrupt. Part of the bankruptcy involved rewriting union contracts to allow the company to stay in business.
Instead of taking one for the team and helping their company crawl out of its fiscal hole, the Bakers went on strike.

                Yes, I’m feeling a wave toward Romney.

My gut tells me this year is a lot like 1980.
1980 Was A Dead Heat
The final Gallup poll that year had a dead heat. Time Magazine’s November 3, 1980, called the race a dead heat. So did Newsweek.
The press was hoping John B. Anderson, a former Republican Congressman running for president as an independent, would siphon votes from Reagan. He did siphon votes from Reagan, but not nearly enough.

                If you can’t find full-time work, blame Obamacare.

One reason the Middle Class has shriveled and wages shrunk over the the past four years is underemployment. People want full time work, but settle for anything. And anything is usually part time.
Most of the fantastic new jobs created since the 2009 have been part-time jobs.
According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 14.6% of Americans want a full-time job but settle for part-time.

First, though, make sure nothing gets in the way of exercising your duty to vote.

                The fog of war is lifting from Benghazi, and what lies beneath should shame Obama’s most ardent supporters. Barack Obama choked, and Americans died.

When America came under attack, Obama panicked and froze.
When Americans under his direction pleaded for their lives, he was afraid to pull the trigger.
Here’s the emerging picture.
White House Ordered Military and CIA to Stand Down and Let Al Qaeda Kill Former Navy SEALs Ty Woods and Glen Doherty, so disgusted by the White House’s refusal to help Americans under attack, defied an order to stand down.

What, then, do we call a person who simultaneously argues two contrary concepts?

How ‘bout “demagogue?”
A few weeks ago, Barack Obama told America’s business owners that they are not responsible for their success. “Someone else built that.”
Today, the same Obama told Mitt Romney that there not many people who consider themselves victims.
Does Mr. Obama believe that people in dire straights are not victims of circumstances?

We&amp;rsquo;re past Empty Chair Day. The conventions are over. Barack Obama still stands between us and liberty. And the Establishment&amp;rsquo;s more worried about its $$$ future than about America&amp;rsquo;s future.
What does that mean? It means _you and I _ will determine what happens in Election 2012 and beyond.
If you want to have a hand in America&amp;rsquo;s future, listen up.

                As if reading from a script written by the Romney campaign, the Democrats on Wednesday managed to mangle their public image even further, this time by booing God and Israel.

On Tuesday, the Democratic National Convention stripped God&amp;rsquo;s name from their platform and rejected Israel&amp;rsquo;s choice of Jerusalem as its capital.
Wednesday, the party panicked and rushed in an amendment to restore God and Jerusalem.

                For years voters have complained that politicians and parties say anything to get a vote. People have longed for the days of plain talk and honesty.
Well, the Democrats passed a new platform today. Two headlines emerged:
  The Democrats rejected any reference to God.
  The Democrats rejected Jerusalem as Israel&amp;rsquo;s capital.
  The question is: can you trust them? Do Democrats really reject God and reject Jerusalem as the center of Israeli political life?

                When I read about Todd Akin&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate comments to Charles Jaco, my first thought was uncharitable. &amp;ldquo;I could just kill him.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I could kill him,&amp;rdquo; is an idiom. Its cousins include &amp;ldquo;wring his neck&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;poke his eyes out.&amp;rdquo; Idioms hyperbolize our emotional reaction to an event.
I was angry because Todd Akin gave the left a great talking point in the infamous interview. I like Todd Akin. I voted for him.

                America is suffocating under an amazing tax burden, but most Americans STILL underestimate how much their tax bill really is. That’s because Washington has done a fantastic job of forcing employers to hide most of the taxes you pay. If people had to see and deal with their total liability, the Democratic Party would be swept into the dust bin of history.

Here are some frightening facts from Rasmussen:

                Choosing Paul Ryan as his running mate was a great Romney move. Looking ahead, Romney sees movement conservatives working hard right up to the election—even if he or his advisors continues to say stupid things. That was necessary.
SCROLL DOWN FOR TWO IMPORTANT EVENTS THIS WEEK
But it wasn’t enough to win the election and unseat America’s first anti-American president. To do that, we must find a way to win over the selfish middle.

                Why did murder skyrocket in Chicago as soon as Rahm Emanuel became mayor? Why have Americans become nastier and meaner since Barack Obama became president?

As Michael Dukakis told us, a fish rots from the head down. Obama surrounds himself with people who thrive on decay and death.
After four years, Obama has nothing to say for himself. Nothing. He can only cut and attack and lie and sneer and mock like a high school bully.

                The horror in Aurora, Colorado, gave President Obama a little cover last Friday. That&amp;rsquo;s because the Labor Department announced that unemployment rose in 27 states.
President Obama promised to hold unemployment under eight percent if Congress passed the stimulus package in 2009. Congress did, but Obama failed. Remember all those green jobs? They&amp;rsquo;re gone.
**The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t Barack Obama; the problem is liberalism. **
Liberals believe that only experts can make intelligent decisions.

                According to research from Missouri Education Watchdog, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) agreed to surrender Missouri&amp;rsquo;s education voice under Obama&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Race to the Top&amp;rdquo; scheme. Race to the Top was a contest in which states agreed to let the federal Department of Education, via two puppet organizations, run all of the state&amp;rsquo;s education systems. In exchange, some states were awarded money, but others were not.
Chris Nicastro, chief rock in the DESE box, applied for the grant.

                Tax credits reward particular businesses or developers with tax dollars from the general population. They concentrate wealth in a few hands. Tax credits are the way politicians play the market with someone else&amp;rsquo;s money.

Worse, **Republicans are addicted to tax credits. **
A Missouri House Republican leader told a constituent that his party gives tax dollars to people who &amp;ldquo;spend it smarter.&amp;rdquo; Bill Clinton said the same thing in about 1992.

                Ronald Reagan loved to tell jokes about the Soviet Union.If Obama’s re-elected, though, these same jokes could be turned on the United States.

Some of them already can be.
 It&amp;rsquo;s hard to get an automobile in the United States. They are owned mainly by elite bureaucrats. It takes an average of 10 years to get a car. 1 out of 7 families owned automobiles. You have to go through a major process and put the money out in advance.

RCP aggregates dozens of polls to produce its RCP average. The method has been remarkably accurate, especially at the state level.
It’s time to focus on preventing the unmitigated disaster of a second Obama term.
In 112 days, Americans will vote on whether or not to continue our experiment in self-government. If the election were held today, that experiment would be aborted.
