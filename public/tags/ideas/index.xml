      <description>On my desk is a book titled &amp;ldquo;Grinning With the Gipper.&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s 117 pages of Ronald Reagan&amp;rsquo;s humor.Think of that. A US president who could fill a book with jokes.
My cursory review shows that about 60 percent of the jokes are on Reagan himself. And another 20 percent are on Republicans.
Ronald Reagan knew that life is too short and too precious to waste it on anger and pride. Better to spend your days getting laughs.</description>

      <description>Yes, I read that. And I saw that. And somebody told me about that, too.
I see the ridiculous charges leveled by ignorant bigots against the Tea Party. I hear the slander on MSNBC and CNN. I know that Ben Jealous and Nancy Pelosi live on lies about you and me the way vampires live on human blood.
I get it.
My immediate urge when I read or hear this nonsense is anger.</description>
