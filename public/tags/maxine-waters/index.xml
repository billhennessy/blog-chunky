      <description>Martin Baker, candidate for Missouri’s 1st Congressional District, lays it on the line, challenging Tea Party critics Maxine Waters and Frederica Wilson.
Read Martin’s challenge:
 Today, I am inviting both of these distinguished ladies to St Louis, Missouri to tell me and my Tea Party compatriots in person why we should go straight to Hell. Congresswoman Waters should know the way here, having been born and raised in our esteemed area and a graduate of Vashon High School, which is in the St Louis Public School District.</description>
