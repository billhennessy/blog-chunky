      <description>What line of work was Tony Soprano in? 
Waste management.
Did Tony Soprano expect people to believe he was in waste management?
No. Tony Soprano expected people realize he was a wise guy and treat him with due respect&amp;ndash;or what you and I call fear.
Some lies are meant to make the liar seem more successful or more talented or better than he thinks he is. Trust me, I&amp;rsquo;ve done it.</description>
