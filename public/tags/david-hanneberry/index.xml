      <description>David Hanneberry lost the love of his life in the capture of Suspect Two—his boat.
@ColorMeRed inspired the idea of buying him a new one.
I’ve started a GoFundMe account to raise $30,000 in 30 days to fund a new boat for Mr. Hanneberry. C’mon, folks, this guy’s a hero. He discovered Tsarnaev in his boat and called the cops. He had the courage to lift the canvas and verify that the bastard was in in there.</description>
