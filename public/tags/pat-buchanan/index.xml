      <description>Pat Buchanan and George Will have a lot in common, but they&amp;rsquo;re very different, too. They&amp;rsquo;re both conservative writers and journalists. But Buchanan&amp;rsquo;s an activist while Will is a passivist. (New word?) Let me explain.
When I was a freshman in college, a professor told me he saw George Will speak. He found Will&amp;rsquo;s conservatism &amp;ldquo;intellectual and reasonable,&amp;rdquo; unlike Ronald Regan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;extremism.&amp;rdquo; It was a shot at my Reaganism. I knew it.</description>

      <description>The middle of the road is fine until you have to get somewhere.
I voted for Bob Dole in 1996. Yet his nomination drove me away from political activism for years.

I got out of the Navy in the fall of 1994. I watched the GOP reclaim the House with my nephew, Scott. I expected the Republicans to nominate a solid conservative who deliver a knock-out blow to the Clinton era two years later.</description>
