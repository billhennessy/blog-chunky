      <description>We all thought it.
&amp;ldquo;This time, for sure, McCaskill goes down.&amp;rdquo;
We&amp;rsquo;ve thought it before and been disappointed. But this time is different, right? This time, we have that up-and-coming Attorney General who&amp;rsquo;s backed by conservatives and establishment Republicans alike. A guy equally at home at a Tea Party conference or a Jack Danforth backyard barbecue. This time, for sure.
But this time looks like another disappointment for Missouri Republicans hoping to send another Republican to the US Senate.</description>
