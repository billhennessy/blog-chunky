      <description>Why not?
Kids have a clean slate when it comes to credit scores. Sure, they don’t have a long history, but you can help with that.
And you can buy that 56-inch 3D LED TV you’ve been craving. In a few months, you might even be able to buy a new car—on your kid’s credit.
**Best of all, you really don’t need to pay it off. Let your kids pay that loan.</description>

FoxNews.com relays a Times of London story of a company that offers to financially, socially, and otherwise ruin people&amp;rsquo;s lives for a meager $20 USD. I won&amp;rsquo;t provide a link to the dreadful site.
 A service offering a complete &amp;ldquo;revenge package&amp;rdquo; in which people can destroy the financial status and relationships of their enemies at the click of a mouse is being offered over the Internet.</description>
