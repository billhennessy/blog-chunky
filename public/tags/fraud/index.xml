      <description>Everyone else is writing about the news that former Missouri Democrat Governor, Roger Wilson and local lawyer Ed Griesedieck Jr. were indicted on federal fraud charges today.
The two allegedly made contributions to the Democrat Party (legal), and reimbursed themselves out of Missouri Employers Mutual Insurance Company’s coffers (illegal).
But that’s not the weird part. After all, election fraud is the Democrats’ principal form of amusement.
The weird part is the statement from Griesedieck’s law firm.</description>

      <description>Watts Up With That has a graph illustrating the ridiculous extent to which James Hansen has gone to perpetuate his global warming myth. Hansen has rewritten US temperature data of the past 2 centuries&amp;ndash;as if he was there.
It&amp;rsquo;s time for NASA to fire Hansen. The DOJ should open a fraud investigation.

      <description>Just watch. And laugh. Then call KTVI&amp;rsquo;s General Manager, Spencer Koch at 314-213-2222, and demand an apology for Sgt. Bilko&amp;rsquo;s latest travesty reported on Gateway Pundit.

Too good to be true? Ask Charles: cjaco@charlesjaco.com.
On April 13, Charles Jaco reported on KTVI News that an organization called The Constitution Party sponsored and helped organize the St. Louis Tea Party. Jaco also claimed that The Constitution Party is a white supremacist group.</description>
