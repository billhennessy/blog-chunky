      <description>The second poll in a week&amp;ndash;this one by USAToday/Gallup&amp;ndash;shows that support for the war in Iraq is growing. The latest poll shows that public perception of America&amp;rsquo;s success has increased substantially in the past month. The numbers coincide with the increasing effectiveness of the surge.
 In the latest USA TODAY/Gallup Poll, taken Friday through Sunday, the proportion of those who said the additional troops are &amp;ldquo;making the situation better&amp;rdquo; rose to 31% from 22% a month ago.</description>
