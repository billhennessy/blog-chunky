      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s what happens when you raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, according to scientists:
Nothing.
Well, not nothing. All kinds of bad things happen to the economy. But nothing happens for two groups of people central to the whole debate: workers who get a bump to $15 and employers who have to bump to $15 an hour.
Most cities and states that have raised their minimum wage laws to $15 will phase in the increase over five years.</description>

(That would come with the passage of the Constitution thirteen years later).** July 4th events teach kids—in an environment free from teacher-union propaganda—the _reasons_ we broke from England.</description>
