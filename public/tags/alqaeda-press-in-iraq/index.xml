      <description>As I predicted last week, the Democrats have hired the Associated Press to make up stories that discredit the success of the surge.
Last week, as good new about the surge was cresting, the AP treated as fact an opinion piece that the &amp;ldquo;body count&amp;rdquo; in Iraq had doubled since the surge began.
Today, AP customers are leading with another AP opinion piece claiming that August was one of the bloodiest months since the Iraq war began.</description>
