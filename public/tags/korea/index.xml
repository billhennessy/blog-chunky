      <description>Five kids is a lot these days. &amp;ldquo;You have five kids? Oh, my God!&amp;rdquo; people say, their eyes bugged out, mouths wide open.
Even when the oldest were babies, developmental psychologists were advising parent not to tell children &amp;ldquo;no.&amp;rdquo; Their theory was that &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; would teach a child limitation and destroy his curiosity. Instead, offer an alternative. Well, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. But the funny thing is, it&amp;rsquo;s the no &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; advice is totally out of synch with society.</description>
