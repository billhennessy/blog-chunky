      <description>The abortion company fires its CEOs as sloppily as it delivers &amp;ldquo;healthcare.&amp;rdquo;
Before that, the Trump Administration successfully cut some of Planned Parenthood&amp;rsquo;s federal funding, which may have precipitated the decapitation of its management team.
And, today, Planned Parenthood&amp;rsquo;s hand-picked judge tentatively ruled in complete favor with the journalist the company is suing.
Aborting Dr. Wen On Wednesday, Planned Parenthood clumsily fired Dr. Leana Wen as its chief executive. I guess you could call it a late-term firing, since Dr.</description>

      <description>I hate to say &amp;ldquo;I told you so.&amp;rdquo;
But the St. Louis Post Dispatch has found that I may have been right on November 8. That&amp;rsquo;s when I made the outlandish comment that the whole race issue at Mizzou is actually an abortion issue. I suspected that Planned Parenthood&amp;rsquo;s vast lobbyist network is agitating leaders of left-leaning organizations trying to create general unrest.
**The manipulators would use campus racial unrest to demand restored privileges for Planned Parenthood.</description>

      <description>A few Mizzou football players announced they&amp;rsquo;re boycotting all sports activities until University of Missouri system president Tim Wolfe quits or is fired. Considering the football team&amp;rsquo;s dismal performance, the cynic in me wonders if sitting out might help the players&amp;rsquo; chances of getting an NFL draft.
The players and other African-American students at Mizzou believe they are victims of &amp;ldquo;systematic oppression&amp;rdquo; and they want Tim Wolfe to fix it simply by resigning.</description>

      <description>Today was a particularly busy day for me.
I had a series of meetings. Like every hour, another meeting. From 9:00 on.
I saw the text from my wife. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to click on a video. I was in a room full of people. Important business. Major client and all that. And I completely misunderstood the &amp;ldquo;H/T Gina L.&amp;rdquo; thing. For some reason, I thought Angela was mad at Gina.</description>
