      <description>The latest Public Policy Poll shows Santorum surging—big time.

**Santorum is most appealing to conservatives—from Evangelicals to Tea Partiers: **
 Santorum is now completely dominating with several key segments of the electorate, especially the most right leaning parts of the party. With those describing themselves as &amp;lsquo;very conservative,&amp;rsquo; he&amp;rsquo;s now winning a majority of voters at 53% to 20% for Gingrich and 15% for Romney. Santorum gets a majority with Tea Party voters as well at 51% to 24% for Gingrich and 12% for Romney.</description>
