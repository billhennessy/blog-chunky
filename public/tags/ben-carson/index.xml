      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to share a secret about manipulation with you. Please do not use this powerful method for sinister deeds.
But first . . .
Disclosure 1: Before I get to the Master Manipulator Model, some important background. I work professionally in the field of persuasion and influence. I even invented a workshop that helps big companies make their stuff more persuasive.
The point is, I study persuasion, and manipulation is persuasion&amp;rsquo;s cousin.</description>

      <description>Reports on Twitter say turnout in Iowa very high.
   Some caucuses are reportedly running out of ballots. Huge turnout! #IowaCaucus

  The view at Dubuque&amp;rsquo;s 19th precinct. We had to move to an auditorium to accommodate the large turnout. #IowaCaucus pic.twitter.com/QcWKY1ivAg

      <description>If you lack a unique, differentiating value, your only play is price.
In business, you command the price play by being very, very big and very, very efficient. In presidential politics, you&amp;rsquo;re unique or you close up shop and go home. Commodities don&amp;rsquo;t win executive offices. Usually.
Even though it&amp;rsquo;s early, only four Republican candidates for president have differentiating value propositions:
** Ben Carson ** Donald Trump ** Carly Fiorina ** Ted Cruz</description>

      <title>What Good Issued From the Candidate Debate?</title>

      <description>Did you hear about the ratings?
Over 24 million people watched the first Republican debate Thursday. That&amp;rsquo;s the largest audience ever for a cable program, save for sports.
Everybody knows why so many watched: people wanted to see a fight break out between Chris Christie and Rand Paul.
Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s presence probably didn&amp;rsquo;t hurt. Let me clarify that. Trump&amp;rsquo;s appearance helped rating. His performance might have ended his campaign.
Donald Trump comported himself with all the dignity and gravitas of a George W.</description>
