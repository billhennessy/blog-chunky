      <description>I planned to get new brakes on my car and to rearrange the storage room in the basement with my week off between Christmas and New Year&amp;rsquo;s. Solitary tasks.
Yesterday, though, like many of you, I read about theBlog Burst for Fred Thompson. I linked to Captain&amp;rsquo;s Quarter&amp;rsquo;s (where I first read the story), then to Rick Moran and John Hawkins, who seem to have launched the effort. For the rest of the day, I found myself e-mailing friends and posting updates about the effort to raise enough money for Fred to run a commercial in Iowa lead up to the caucuses.</description>
