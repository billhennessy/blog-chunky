      <description>Hillary, Obama, and much of the Democrat Party have fomented race hatred for years. They&amp;rsquo;ve ratcheted up their lies in recent months, hoping to turn race hatred into votes. They are that cynical and self-serving.
Now, Hillary and Obama have lost control of the fire they started. Crazed, racist murderers all across the country have declared war on police officers. From Dallas, Texas, to Ballwin, Missouri, to Baton Rouge, Louisianna, Hillary has sent a message that says it&amp;rsquo;s okay to kill a cop.</description>
