      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t you just love brash upstarts? People with verve and moxie?
I do. I like pesky guys full of gumption, like Vladimir Sobotka. I like energetic young political activists like Kenny Newhouse. And I like bold conservative organizers like Eileen Tyrrell. In fact, nothing pleases me more than seeing young, libertarian-ish Republicans making the establishment squirm.
Sometimes the squirming establishment is as small as a GOP township or a school district.</description>
