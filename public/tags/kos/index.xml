      <description>Like all decent people, I am disgusted to hear the sad news out of Tucson, AZ: Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) was shot and killed along with four others today. Twelve were shot altogether. The murderer was apprehended by heroic bystanders and is in custody.
Not sure of the young murderer’s motives. I’m sure they weren’t worth killing or dying for. Except to him.
Please prayer for the souls of the faithful departed, the well-being of their families, the quick recovery of the wounded, and the delivery of justice.</description>

      <description>Too much of a good thing, as my mother would say, turns bad.
When Chesterton wrote &amp;ldquo;Orthodoxy&amp;rdquo; in 1908, he looked at his modern times and pitied their unimaginative banality. He would surely weep aloud were he to observe our times.
&amp;ldquo;The modern world,&amp;rdquo; he wrote a century ago, &amp;ldquo;is full of the old Christian virtues gone mad. The virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone.</description>
