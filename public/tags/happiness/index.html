                A great colleague and I invented something in 2010. It was a two-day workshop for companies. It has been incredibly successful.
In that workshop, we cite a lot of behavioral science research. We also point out that some behavioral science research is bogus. Up to 60 percent by a recent study (which might have been bogus itself.) So how do you know good science from bad?
Look for consistency. I&amp;rsquo;ll give you an example.

That&amp;rsquo;s because God has already given us the only plan we need. A plan to get through this life worthy of the next. And that is enough.

Glenn Beck, Erick Erickson, and other Republicans have convinced a lot of people that we are doomed if Donald Trump wins the Republican nomination. I know some people who are nearly incapacitated with fear and grief after last night&amp;rsquo;s Nevada caucuses. Because they listen to Glenn Beck. Sad!

Something has to give, and it&amp;rsquo;s usually the thing that doesn&amp;rsquo;t generate revenue.

                Some of the biggest potholes on the road to happiness come from bad advice from self-help “experts.”
But here are three scientifically proven steps to being happier. And since happiness causes success in other areas, not the other way around, these could be the most important tasks you perform.
Give Thanks
People who write down three things they’re grateful for and the reason those things happened show a 50 percent drop in medical claims over six months compared to a control group who journaled about nothing in particular (Emmons &amp;amp; McCullough).

                We talk about liberty, limited government, freedom, Constitutional principles, and the like. Those are all relevant to the purposes of the conservative grassroots movement. But are they ends? Or are they just means?
I believe they are means. In the founders’ writings we find clues to the end, even they don’t state it explicitly. Jefferson did. Jay came close. And Adams implicitly understood that end.

Let me ask this: what’s the point of all the work we did in the past two years?

                Is it better to give or to receive?
Before you answer, let’s look at some of the science behind giving. Then let’s look a little deeper.
Dr. Barbara Fredrickson studies the psychology of happiness. About a decade ago, Dr. Fredrickson announced a formula for creating an “upward spiral” of happiness. In other words, she identified what it takes to have happiness breed happiness. The formula applies to individuals, families, groups, and even companies.

                Earlier, I wrote about a little trick for making your day a little happier than it otherwise would have been. Now, there are a lot of reasons why I should wish to make you happier. But I have to admit that there’s something in it for me.
No, I don’t get 3 cents every time someone registers on ThankfulFor.com. But as a member of several grassroots organizations trying to change America, I want my teammates to be in the best possible spirits.

                Happiness is a choice; anger is a tactic.
Anger will have to wait for a future post. This one is about happiness. So let me ask: would you do something that took less than a minute if that something would make you happier?
Martin Seligman at University of Pennsylvania’s school of Positive Psychology has broken down happiness in more scientifically measurable components:
* Positive Emotion** Engagement** Purpose  Other research has shown how to increase your happiness score.

                Feeling confident, relaxed, and complete is a dream. Many people believe it&amp;rsquo;s an impossible dream. I&amp;rsquo;m learning otherwise.
I&amp;rsquo;m into my third month of acquiring positive habits with Leo Babauta&amp;rsquo;sZen to Done method. At the same time, I&amp;rsquo;m working the 30 day challenge. What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far is that I hold onto too much.
 * I carried around anger and frustration over missed goals and failed or abandoned projects * I vilified good people (in my mind) because I wanted to get my way all the time about everything * I sabotaged myself by trying to do everything anyone asked of me * I was afraid to look weak, and that fear weakened me  The faultering economy, no doubt, led me toZen Habits, which led me to Zen to Done, which led me to &amp;ldquo;The Power of Less,&amp;rdquo; which led me to theSedona Method, which led me here.
