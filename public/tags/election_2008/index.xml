      <description>Even though he spoke the words much earlier during the Tonight Show&amp;rsquo;s taping, just moments ago, Americans heard it for the first time. &amp;ldquo;I am running for President of the United States,&amp;rdquo; Fred told Jay Leno. If the audience in NBC&amp;rsquo;s Burbank studios represented a cross-section of the US, then Fred&amp;rsquo;s announcement is a welcome one. The audience went wild.
I got the feeling Fred was a little tight just around the time he said he&amp;rsquo;s running.</description>

      <description>Fred Thompson will appear as a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno tonight.
Don&amp;rsquo;t miss it. How often do you get to see the next President of the United States announce his candidacy live on a late night talk show?</description>

      <title>Maybe We Need a Lazy President</title>

      <description>The MSM are tripping over themselves to publish stories about Fred Thompson&amp;rsquo;s supposed laziness. Newsweek decided to make the accusation head on (from CNN.com):
 [A]s he prepares to formally begin his campaign for the White House this week, after months of &amp;ldquo;testing the waters,&amp;rdquo; the conventional wisdom in Washington is that Thompson doesn&amp;rsquo;t want it badly enough, isn&amp;rsquo;t willing to work hard enough-put bluntly, that he is lazy.

      <title>Thompson Gaining Social Conservatives</title>

      <description>Boston.com reports that social conservatives are &amp;ldquo;coalescing&amp;rdquo; around Fred Thompson as their choice for Republican nominee for President in 2008.
 &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a consensus developing around him that&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear and pretty profound,&amp;rdquo; said John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, an Orlando-based conservative group. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anything like it in 25 years in politics.&amp;rdquo;
 I agree. In 1979, as a high school sophomore with a National Review subscription, I became dissatisfied (for a short time) with the GOP.</description>
