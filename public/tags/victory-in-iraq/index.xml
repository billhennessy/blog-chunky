      <description>Tell everyone Hennessy broke the story. America won the Iraq war. The insurgency is broken! Peace prevails. The terrorists are routed!Where are the headlines? A man between the ages of 18 and 30 has a better chance of being murdered in Philadelphiathan of dying in Iraq in September. The third head of al Qaeda in Iraq is dead&amp;ndash;three in 18 months. Ascending to that throne is no promotion. Face it, folks, we won the war.</description>
