      <description>I admire David French, David French is running for president, but you probably have no idea who he is, right?
No, it&amp;rsquo;s not Buffy and Jody&amp;rsquo;s man-nanny from the 1960s sitcom Family Affair. That was Mr. French played by Sebastian Cabot, and I forget the character&amp;rsquo;s first name.
Nor is it the guy who publishes most stage play scripts. That&amp;rsquo;s Samuel French. (Only theatre people will know that name.)
If you&amp;rsquo;re a hard-core conservative or you read National Review for any reason, you might have heard of David French.</description>
