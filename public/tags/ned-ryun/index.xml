      <description>American Majority Action deserves a huge dose of the credit for Ed Martin’s tight race for Missouri’s 3rd district in 2010. But their ground help in September and October was only the tip of the iceberg.
Dana Loesch and I met American Majority back in April. Ned Ryun, the founder and president, asked us to speak at the group’s Post-Party Summit in Kansas City. The weekend was fabulous, informative, and fun.</description>

      <description>Ned Ryun, President of American Majority, has opened a new chapter in America’s conservative grassroots movement.
On Saturday, a crowd of several hundred 9-12 Project and Tea Party organizers heard Ryun explain why it’s time to move beyond the rallies at the American Majority Post-Party Summit in Kansas City. I have mentioned this before, and it seems to bother many people. I understand why.

The rally was the animating function of the Tea Party movement.</description>
