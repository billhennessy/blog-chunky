      <description>Patrick Tuohey made some good points about the office of Lieutenant Governor. Based on that, I thought up all the possible reasons someone would run for LooeyG.
1. Stepping Stone: Establish state-wide name recognition and give yourself plenty of time to run for that next office, like U.S. Senate or Governor.
2. Party Reptile: If the governor is or is likely to be of the opposite party, you get to be the de facto head of your party in the state.</description>
