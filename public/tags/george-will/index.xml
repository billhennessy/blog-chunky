      <description>Pat Buchanan and George Will have a lot in common, but they&amp;rsquo;re very different, too. They&amp;rsquo;re both conservative writers and journalists. But Buchanan&amp;rsquo;s an activist while Will is a passivist. (New word?) Let me explain.
When I was a freshman in college, a professor told me he saw George Will speak. He found Will&amp;rsquo;s conservatism &amp;ldquo;intellectual and reasonable,&amp;rdquo; unlike Ronald Regan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;extremism.&amp;rdquo; It was a shot at my Reaganism. I knew it.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever cheated on your spouse just to get back at your daughter for dating or marrying the wrong man, you&amp;rsquo;re probably a #nevertrump person like George Will.
Suppose your daughter married a man you didn&amp;rsquo;t approve of. You would probably respond by cheating on your own spouse, would you not? Having an affair would teach your daughter a lesson, right? And if your spouse and your friends and your other children suffered, too bad.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I’m ashamed and embarrassed at my roots. See, I graduated from the same Catholic grade school as St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, I know. But how else do I react to stories like this one from George Will.
It seems that Mayor Slay’s administration is busy trampling all over the rights of a citizen, Jim Roos.
Roos painted a sign on a building he owns that days “End Eminent Domain Abuse.</description>
