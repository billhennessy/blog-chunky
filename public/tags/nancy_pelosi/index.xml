      <description>Democrats are planning to punish the American people with draconian, destructive legislation during the lame duck session following November’s election, according the Wall Street Journal.
 That&amp;rsquo;s why there have been signs in recent weeks that party leaders are planning an ambitious, lame-duck session to muscle through bills in December they don&amp;rsquo;t want to defend before November. Retiring or defeated members of Congress would then be able to vote for sweeping legislation without any fear of voter retaliation.</description>

      <description>Last night in the U.S. House of Representatives, a party&amp;rsquo;s leadership refused to abide by a legal vote (Volunteer Opinion Journal).
The vote was on a Republican measure to strip from a farm bill language that guaranteed welfare for illegal aliens. The vote was 215-213 in favor of stripping the guarantees.
But Nancy Pelosi wanted a different result. So, her minions essentially burned the ballots, declared there was no vote, and ordered a new one (Michelle Malkin).</description>
