      <description>From the &amp;ldquo;we could have told you that&amp;rdquo; department:
 Journalists&amp;rsquo; brains show a lower-than-average level of executive functioning, according to a new study, which means they have a below-average ability to regulate their emotions, suppress biases, solve complex problems, switch between tasks, and show creative and flexible thinking. [emphasis added]
 It&amp;rsquo;s okay to laugh. You suspected that reporters are kind of dumb. Now you know. They can&amp;rsquo;t keep up with Trump, but they probably can&amp;rsquo;t keep up with a young adult novella, either.</description>
