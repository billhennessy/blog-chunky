      <description>&amp;ldquo;What was the biggest adjustment for you going from the military to the business world?&amp;rdquo;
Several people have asked me that question, and my answer always surprises them.
&amp;ldquo;In the military,&amp;rdquo; I say, &amp;ldquo;every individual has a lot more latitude and authority to act. In the business world, no one can do anything without explicit instructions.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Really? I thought it would be the other way around,&amp;rdquo; they say.
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s the popular culture, but the truth is one-hundred eighty degrees the other way.</description>
