      <description>Gary Weigert, State Rep. Paul Curtman, and I will share a panel at Show-Me Cannabis Reform Spring Conference Saturday, April 13 from 1:45 to 2:30 pm at the Crowne Plaza Downtown, 200 N. Fourth St.
Our panel discusses the conservative case for marijuana law reform.
I am honored by the invitation, and I’d love to see a big turnout of tea partiers for the event.

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;d think people would listen when a career police officer says we need to reform marijuana laws. But n-o-o-o-o. Not in St. Louis, anyway.
Gary Wiegert is a 30+ year police officer who signed up to lobby Jefferson City on behalf of tea party issues a couple of years ago. Some people freaked out over that, but Gary was instrumental in advancing tea party issues for the past 2 years.</description>
