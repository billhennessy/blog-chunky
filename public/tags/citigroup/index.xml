      <description>**UPDATE Union Declares Victory AsHostess Goes Out of Business. No more Ho Hos. ****
Unions destroy themselves like pathetic drunks, dragging down everyone around them.

In a fine example of anti-strategic thinking and un-game theory, the Bakers Union put 637 of its members out of work yesterday.
Hostess—makers of Twinkies—is bankrupt. Part of the bankruptcy involved rewriting union contracts to allow the company to stay in business.
Instead of taking one for the team and helping their company crawl out of its fiscal hole, the Bakers went on strike.</description>

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know why, then you&amp;rsquo;re reading the wrong blog.
The New Agenda is keeping tabs on sponsors of David Letterman&amp;rsquo;s show. I have already told T-Mobile that I will cancel may $120 month service (paying the penalty) if they don&amp;rsquo;t stop advertising on The Late Show by July 15.
Top names on the boycott list:
 * Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson * T-Mobile * Ford * Nissan/Infiniti * Toyota/Lexus * Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble * Citigroup (which should be out of business, anyway) * Chase (JPMC) * The Gap (plus Old Navy and Banana Republic) * Wyeth * Saturn * Hotels.</description>
