      <description>I was a guest of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM channel 125 yesterday. Dan Riehl wrote this very nice story about my appearance on Breitbart News:
   Tea Party activist Bill Hennessy chronicled his transition from Donald Trump opposition to Trump supporter in the book Turning on Trump and shared some of his insights with_Breitbart News Daily_ SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon Wednesday.  “I started off very anti-Trump,” said Hennessy, “and over the course of the primary season, I did a complete one-eighty.</description>

      <description>I sent one email to Jamie Allman. He&amp;rsquo;s such a great guy, he invited me on two of his shows. Probably not because of me, but because of the subject of Turning On Trump. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s an honor. Thank you, Jamie.
If you&amp;rsquo;re as curious about Turning On Trump as Jamie Allman is, listen to his show on97.1 FM Tuesday, July 5 at 7:20 a.m. We&amp;rsquo;ll wait while you make a note to listen.</description>

      <title>Mark Levin Is Turning On Trump</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s outstanding,&amp;rdquo; said the Great One.
 The Republican leadership in Congress doesn’t have the guts to go to the floor of the Senate or the floor of the House and make these charges. This is outstanding. You can’t let Hillary Clinton get away with her corruption, her cronyism, her criminality. I don’t care who you support or don’t support. She’s detestable.

Mark Levin said some terrible things about Donald Trump.</description>

      <description>Do you want to know what Trump supporters are thinking? Many people do.
If you supported Ted Cruz, you might not understand how the guy who wrote The Conservative Manifesto in 1993 could support Trump.
If you supported Marco Rubio or Ben Carson last year, how do you reconcile your convictions with Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s bizarre life?
Is Donald Trump a conservative or not?
I&amp;rsquo;ve written a new book about all these things, and you can buy your copy soon.</description>
