      <description>I sent one email to Jamie Allman. He&amp;rsquo;s such a great guy, he invited me on two of his shows. Probably not because of me, but because of the subject of Turning On Trump. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s an honor. Thank you, Jamie.
If you&amp;rsquo;re as curious about Turning On Trump as Jamie Allman is, listen to his show on97.1 FM Tuesday, July 5 at 7:20 a.m. We&amp;rsquo;ll wait while you make a note to listen.</description>
