      <description>I think I was upset about losing a baseball game. I don’t remember. I’m better now, but when I was a kid, everybody knew when I was upset. I made sure of it.
And I hated when someone tried to break those foul moods.
Wouldn’t you know it. My mom said, “count your blessings.”
Yeah. What blessings? We lost! Wasn’t she listening?
I was a real peach.
It turns out, my mom was right.</description>
