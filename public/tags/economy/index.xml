      <description>Guest post by Lee Presser.
America’s fiscal year is October 1 to September 30. With two month left in FY16, the U.S. Treasury has already paid creditors $380,925,428,211.67 in interest costs. (That’s $381 Billion) https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm
The average interest rate was just over 2%. https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/pd/avg/2016/2016_07.htm
 It is expected that the last two month’s of this fiscal year, interest costs will increase another $45 to $66 Billion. The total FY16 interest cost may be between $426 and $447 Billion.</description>

      <description>What has 50 years of loyalty to Democrats won for African-Americans?
If you answered &amp;ldquo;civil rights legislation,&amp;rdquo; you better look at who voted for the laws and who opposed. (Hint: Republicans yea, Democrats nay.)
Welfare? In 1967 the poverty rate was 14 percent. In 2014, the poverty rate was 14 percent. In the interim, we pissed away $22 trillion on bureaucratic sex junkets to Costa Rica and massive government office buildings in every major city.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I missed this.
It&amp;rsquo;s the story of Marienthal Austria.
Marienthal was a town in Austria that thrived thanks to a single employer. When the flax mill went out of business in 1932, Marienthal&amp;rsquo;s population became mostly unemployed.
Thanks to Austria&amp;rsquo;s liberal unemployment programs that replaced up to 90 percent of income, no one in Marienthal plunged into economic poverty as a result of the mill&amp;rsquo;s closing. But spiritual poverty was another story.</description>

      <description>Oh but now old friends they&amp;rsquo;re acting strange, They shake their heads, they say I&amp;rsquo;ve changed Well something&amp;rsquo;s lost, but something&amp;rsquo;s gained In living every day. &amp;ndash;Joni Mitchell, Both Sides Now
 I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at poor from both sides now.
I get a lot of grief for pushing poverty solutions. And service. Many conservatives believe Mitt Romney was right when he uttered his infamous 47 percent line.

      <title>Quick Note on Market</title>

      <description>I was up early this morning sifting through the market stories.
** Asia: crash ** Middle East: crash ** Europe: crash ** USA: set to open
There&amp;rsquo;s good news in all this loss. First, stocks were overpriced. At some point, they will bottom out and it will be time to start buying. Second, the Golden Age of the Central Banker seems to be over. And that is very good news.</description>
