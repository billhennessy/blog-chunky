      <description>I’ve written about this before.
The problem with traffic signals is that they make all of the problems they’re designed to solve worse. By “all the problems” I mean: * Pollution * Congestion * Deaths * Accidents * Speed of Transit * Risk to pedestrians (except those with certain disabilities)
Banning red light cameras is a great first step, but the ultimate goal should be elimination of traffic lights altogether.</description>

      <description>A town in England has reduced traffic congestion, pollution, and accidents. One year after the experiment began, the townspeople gushed over the change in the people and the way they drive. One woman’s commute went from twenty minutes to five.
How did this happen?
The town did the opposite of what had always been done. Instead of adding more traffic lights or signs or spy cameras, they went the other direction.</description>
