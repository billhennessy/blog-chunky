      <title>Missouri&#39;s Festering Wound</title>

      <description>They say that time heals all wounds. But some wounds don&amp;rsquo;t heal. They fester and metastasize until pain demands the intervention of a surgeon&amp;rsquo;s scalpel.
Two years have passed since Eric Greitens was carried from the Missouri Governor&amp;rsquo;s Mansion by a toxic cocktail of lies, false allegations, and prosecutorial misconduct.
For two years, Missouri&amp;rsquo;s media and establishment Republicans pretended it never happened. They never liked Greitens, and they wanted him to go away.</description>

      <description>Last week, the Missouri Ethics Commission fined former Governor Eric Greitens for nothing. Literally, they fined him for doing nothing wrong.
Even CNN finds the Missour Ethics Commission unethical and repulsive:
 A Missouri panel &amp;ldquo;found no evidence of any wrongdoing&amp;rdquo; by former Gov. Eric Greitens following a nearly 18-month investigation into allegations of misconduct by his 2016 gubernatorial campaign, according to a report released Thursday (CNN)
 Political pressure from the current Missouri governor undoubtedly weighed on the MEC.</description>

      <description>Scott Faughn is the publisher of the lobbyist &amp;ldquo;newspaper&amp;rdquo; Missouri Times and bagman for the sponsors of the illegal prosecution of Eric Greitens.
When he was caught delivering a laundry bag of cash to attorney Al Watkins to pay off Greitens&amp;rsquo; accusers and others, the always-broke Faughn claimed the money was somehow related to his forthcoming book on the Greitens administration. He even told his audience that they could order the book at at his website, scottfaughn.</description>

      <description>What is &amp;ldquo;rent-seeking?&amp;rdquo;
Here&amp;rsquo; a brief description from David John Marotta, What Is Rent-Seeking Behavior in Forbes
 Rent-seeking doesn&amp;rsquo;t add any national value. It is coerced trade and benefits only one side. Rent-seeking can include piracy, lobbying the government or even just giving away money.
 There are two kinds of lobbyists.
One kind of lobbyist is necessary to keep legislators and executive-branch bureaucrats informed and on notice. These lobbyists protect the interests of special interest group, but often their special interest needs protection because it is at the mercy of the government.</description>

      <description>Parson will sell everything that isn&amp;rsquo;t nailed down.
 When the media, crooked businessmen, and corrupt politicians were in the midst of their coup against Eric Greitens, a friend told me, &amp;ldquo;If they get rid of Greitens, Parson will sell everything that isn&amp;rsquo;t nailed down.&amp;rdquo;
My friend was wrong. Governor Mike Parson (who may or may not have been a conspirator in the coup) is selling everything in Missouri, but he isn&amp;rsquo;t stopping at the loose items.</description>
