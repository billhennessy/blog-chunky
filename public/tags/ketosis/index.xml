      <description>I invite you to join a centuries-old tradition: fasting for a cause. Moses and Jesus fasted for 40 days. But this Primary Fast will last only 14. Some fasts require that you eat nothing during the fast. But this Primary Fast lets you eat one full, wonderful meal a day. Did you know that General Stanley McChrystal has lived on just one meal a day for decades. And one meal a day was enough to drive him through the war against al Qaeda.</description>

      <description>Remember when you were a kid? All the weird challenges and contests you&amp;rsquo;d wage with your friends? There&amp;rsquo;s a good chance that breath-holding was one of them. Who can hold their breath the longest, right?
I was always good at this when I was young, but I&amp;rsquo;m not that young anymore. I&amp;rsquo;m 53, but I held my breath for two minutes and 47 seconds last Thursday. And I could have gone longer, but I was bored.</description>
