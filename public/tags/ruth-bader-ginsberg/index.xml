      <description>From Mark Steyn:
 Justice Ginsburg swung by Cairo last month to help out the lads from the Muslim Brotherhood building the new Egypt: “I would not look to the   United States Constitution if I were drafting a constitution in the year 2012,” she advised them.
 That a sitting Supreme Court justice would denigrate the Constitution she&amp;rsquo;s sworn to uphold in a foreign country deserves the sort of scorn normally reserved for traitors.</description>

      <description>I’m often amazed at the weakness of arguments before the Supreme Court. Today, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, attempting to help out the Obama Administration’s fumbling solicitor-general, made the weakest argument I’ve ever heard.
First,Ginsburg statement:
 Mr. Verrilli, I thought that your main point is that, unlike food or any other market, when you made the choice not to buy insurance, even though you have every intent in the world to self-insure, to save for it, when disaster strikes, you may not have the money.</description>
