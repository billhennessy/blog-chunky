      <description>Over the years I’ve said and written nasty things about liberals. Liberals, progressives, lefties, whatever the name.
And I’ve defended conservatives—blindly at times. I’ve publicly defended policies I privately considered stupid.
All in the name of advancing my agenda. I believed—and still believe—the liberty agenda is the best one. The only one for people live out the full potential of their lives, to own their own lives, and to leave the world better than they found it.</description>
