      <description>Almost every time Donald Trump says something crazy, something so outlandish and wrong, he later turns out to be right.
I know his critics can&amp;rsquo;t read my blog. (Literally, they can&amp;rsquo;t. They have a psychological problem that prevents their brains from processing information that&amp;rsquo;s inconsistent with their beliefs.) But for those of you who want to be right with the truth instead of just right with your own opinion, this will be a great post to forward to your friends.</description>
