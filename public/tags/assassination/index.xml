I replaced &amp;ldquo;Trump&amp;rdquo; in the original tweets with &amp;ldquo;Hillary.&amp;rdquo; You can see these death-happy tweets and many, many more on Breitbart.com. Real people openly call for assassination as if they were rooting for a basketball team. Scary, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?
You didn&amp;rsquo;t miss the media outrage over these tweet&amp;ndash;it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen.</description>
