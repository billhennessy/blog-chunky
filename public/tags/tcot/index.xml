      <description>Jim Durbin called me this evening. &amp;ldquo;Are you excited?&amp;rdquo; he asked.
Jim was in the crowd at the very first Tea Party in St. Louis, February 27, 2009. A cold Friday. He and more than a thousand other folks took off work and school to see what this protest was all about. Like so many others, Jim knew America needed a change. A big one. A change built on the hopes and dreams and fierce independence of ordinary people.</description>

      <description>The St. Louis Cardinals were the major league team farthest west and farthest south until the 1950s. But that’s not the only reason the Redbirds built a massive flock of fans from the Alleghenies to the Rockies, and from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
The St. Louis Cardinals owe big government statism and technological innovation a big thanks, in addition to geography and great teams. The technology was radio. The big government statist?</description>

      <description>Ed Martin Jr. of St. Louis has redirected his fire to the Attorney General race, and this is great news for everyone except Chris Koster.
Back when Ed Martin was talking about running for the Republican nod to take on Claire McCaskill, I had another thought. Well, a bunch of people had another thought: Ed would make an outstanding Attorney General.
UPDATE
HUGE list of endorsements on Ed’s official press release.</description>

      <description>U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson today ruled Obamacare directly violates the Constitution by mandating that citizens buy health insurance.
This ruling goes further than the previous Virginia ruling. Judge Vinson declared the entire Obamacare bill unconstitutional because the individual mandate portion is not severable from the rest of the law.
Third, Judge Vinson granted the plaintiffs “declaratory relief,” the functional equivalent of an injunction, freeing them from the burden of compliance.</description>

      <description>Dangerous Thoughts Standing in the Wings
_Why are you here? _I thought.
I was standing on the steps of the Arch fully aware that my fingers were painfully cold when the wrong thought crossed my mind. By &amp;ldquo;wrong thought,&amp;rdquo; I mean that one thought that will subconsciously sabotage the important or dangerous thing you are about to attempt. Like thinking, &amp;ldquo;what if the front wheel just fell off?&amp;rdquo; as you&amp;rsquo;re cruising down a winding road on a motorcycle, or &amp;ldquo;what if I forget my lines?</description>

      <description>Thanks to the 1,000+ patriots who stood in the snow at the Arch, Dana &amp;ldquo;The Energizer&amp;rdquo; Loesch, Doug Saur, the speakers, Michelle Moore and Jeff who managed the fairgrounds, Desiree&amp;rsquo; the Poster Party Lady, and the true leaders at #TCOT who held my hand after I stumbled into this event. Today at the Arch in St. Louis was simple patriotic magic. I have to do some wrapping up of the event, but I&amp;rsquo;ll say this:</description>

      <title>How to Change the World with Twitter</title>

      <description>My light blogging owes to our efforts to change the world in a week. My role is, appropriately, miniscule.
When Congress listens, it will repeal the trillions of waste, fraud, and abuse it has produced over the past 4 months, it will stop proposed borrowing and bailouts, it will stop rewarding bad behavior in corporations and citizens, or it will retire. This time, there are no two ways.
 Using tools like Twitter, email, and Facebook, TCOT has provided at least 163 patriots a forum to voice its discontent on Friday, February 27 at 11:00 a.</description>

      <title>Matt Sczesny Rocks, and other Tea Party News</title>

      <description>Great coverage of the St. Louis Tea Party on KMOV Channel 4 by reporter Matt Sczesny. Channel 4 has not posted the video (that I can find). I&amp;rsquo;ll link or embed it as soon as it&amp;rsquo;s available.
Please say &amp;ldquo;thanks&amp;rdquo; to Matt and KMOV for a fair report.
 Amy at Top Conservatives on Twitter has put together a convenient list of the Tea Parties across the country. This list is NOT exhaustive, as not all cities have a Facebook Event page.</description>

      <description>Go Dana. How &amp;lsquo;bout a little equal time? Why does the WU prof get 80 percent of the time?
DELETED VIDEO EMBED
I detest videos that start automatically. You can see the report on KSDK&amp;rsquo;s web site. Not the best coverage, certainly not fair, but publicity is publicity. So thanks to Rebecca for visiting with Dana and selecting 7 seconds of the interview to air ahead of 30 minutes of some college professor who wrote a book in his spare time.</description>

      <description>The future is ours. Your disgust with the borrowing and spending, your noble desire to restore the republic the founders wrought, those are the real protests. The tea party is in our hearts and souls&amp;ndash;the events are just the physical manifestations. But now, the President:
Ninety percent of live blog posts suck. So I did my blog readers a big favor: I tested my quips on Twitter. Here I present my instant reactions that were good enough to get retweeted.</description>

      <title>Uncle Barry’s Adding Machine Stimulator Regulation Gimmick</title>
      <link>https://hennessysview.com/2009/02/23/uncle-barrys-adding-machine-stimulator-regulation-gimmick/</link>

      <description>A few weeks ago, shortly after his inauguration, Barry “The President” Obama panicked: the Republicans might talk the people out of the stimulus bill.
Barry moved quickly. But Barry is an organizer, not an engineer. He’s the cheerleader, not the quarterback. He moves mobs, not nations. And when panicked, he fell apart.
Barry decided to announce that life as we know it would economically end the Day After The Stimulus Bill Is Defeated.</description>
