      <description>From the New York Times:
 President Obama, who came to office promising transparency and adherence to the rule of law, has become the first president to claim the legal authority to order an American citizen killed without judicial involvement, real oversight or public accountability.
 In one sentence, the newspaper conservatives love to hate condemned Barack Obama to the title “dictator.”
Those who voted for him—the ones who still want to be thought of as “American”—will rationalize.</description>
