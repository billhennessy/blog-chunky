      <description>Should Christians love this world?
A Catholic parish has, as part of its mission statement, &amp;ldquo;we love this world.&amp;rdquo;
Does this bother anyone? Besides me, I mean.
I Googled the whole phrase, and here are the top 5 results:
 Do Not Love the World What Does It Mean to &amp;ldquo;Love not the things of the world?&amp;rdquo; What does it mean that we are not to love the world? Love Not the World 1 John 2:15 Do not love the world or anything in the world.</description>

      <description>God gives us so many opportunities to love our enemies. How often do we take him up on those offers?
One of those opportunities to love came to us yesterday. Independent counsel Robert Mueller delivered to the Attorney General his final report on potential crimes involving the 2016 presidential election and the Trump campaign.
The lede of that story was this: no new indictments.
And the left lost their minds.</description>

      <description>Tina Turner not withstanding, love is not an emotion, and that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing.
In today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel (from the modern lectionary), Jesus tells his disciples to &amp;ldquo;love your enemies&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;pray for those who persecute you.&amp;rdquo;
But how? I find it difficult even to be around certain people, much less love them. Surely, Jesus wasn&amp;rsquo;t serious when He told us to love our enemies, right? If Jesus meant what He said, then I must not know what love means.</description>

      <description>You can&amp;rsquo;t change the world in your living room.
That&amp;rsquo;s why a small band of (mostly) white people from (mostly) West County drove to Ferguson (and Dellwood) to shop tonight.
We targeted the small businesses that were hit hard by violence&amp;ndash;violence committed (mostly) by out of town agitators, criminals, vandals, and hooligans.
We drove to Ferguson to make two statements with our actons: 1) Ferguson is OUR community, and 2) Ferguson is open for business.</description>

      <description>David Hanneberry lost the love of his life in the capture of Suspect Two—his boat.
@ColorMeRed inspired the idea of buying him a new one.
I’ve started a GoFundMe account to raise $30,000 in 30 days to fund a new boat for Mr. Hanneberry. C’mon, folks, this guy’s a hero. He discovered Tsarnaev in his boat and called the cops. He had the courage to lift the canvas and verify that the bastard was in in there.</description>
