      <description>Forgive me. I say &amp;ldquo;liberal&amp;rdquo; sometimes when I mean something else.
My mistake is habit, not irony. (Irony would require some intent on my part.)
I grew up disparaging liberalism. I grew up reading and watching William F. Buckley Jr., for whom liberalism was the enemy.
In the post-WWII era, the liberalism of the day was a problem. But it was never the problem.
The problem in Western Civilization was a faction that used liberalism as cover.</description>
