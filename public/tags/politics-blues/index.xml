      <description>After the 1998 Rams season, I walked into City Limits bar or Brothers bar or whatever its name was then. It&amp;rsquo;s a strip mall bar in Wildwood. Cindy Schuenke was tending bar, and we started talking about the Rams&amp;rsquo; dismal season. She said they were hopeless, but I disagreed. &amp;ldquo;They are four players away,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;A quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a defensive end.&amp;rdquo;
Later in the year, but before the season, the Rams acquired Trent Green (and Kurt Warner) at QB, Marshall Faulk at RB, Adam Timmermann at offensive guard, and Grant Wistrom moved up to start at defensive end.</description>

      <description>Harsh, I know.
The St. Louis Blues disappeared from the NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs in a 4-2, first-round collapse for the third consecutive season.
And this year was supposed to be different. So different. With off-season pickups like Jori Lehtera and Paul Stastny, we expected St. Louis to shut down for a parade in June, not in the 3rd period of game six.
Instead, we&amp;rsquo;re wondering how soon will T.J. Oshie sweaters go on the clearance rack at Dick&amp;rsquo;s?</description>
