      <description>Ed Martin’s launched the HealthcareFreedomPledge.com site.

Here you can find candidates who committed to protecting your right to choose your own healthcare options.
Great idea. The site contains short statements from candidates for both state and federal office who pledge to defend our basic rights.
Ask candidates in your area to sign the pledge today.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday, Missouri becomes the first state in the union to vote on ObamaCare. If being a Tea Partyer means anything, it means you vote Yes on Prop C on Tuesday. I urge not to wing it.
Most elections, I wake up and think “it’s election day.” Then I take a shower and go to work. I think about stopping to vote, but I don’t want to walk into the office at 9:00.</description>
