      <description>Should Christians love this world?
A Catholic parish has, as part of its mission statement, &amp;ldquo;we love this world.&amp;rdquo;
Does this bother anyone? Besides me, I mean.
I Googled the whole phrase, and here are the top 5 results:
 Do Not Love the World What Does It Mean to &amp;ldquo;Love not the things of the world?&amp;rdquo; What does it mean that we are not to love the world? Love Not the World 1 John 2:15 Do not love the world or anything in the world.</description>

      <description>There are two kinds of people in America: those who grow up to become productive adults, and those who become bureaucrats.
The GSA scandal lit up the 3 Stooges mentality of the &amp;ldquo;men and women&amp;rdquo; who would run every aspect of your life if Obama and his czars get their way.

Jeff Neely&amp;rsquo;s the guy Thomas Jefferson had in mind when wrote:
 He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.</description>

      <description>Let me get this straight. Secret Service Agents and some military guys brought more than 20 &amp;ndash; count &amp;lsquo;em, _twenty _&amp;ndash; hookers to a hotel in Cartagena, Columbia. The Americans were drinking&amp;ndash;a lot, according to hotel staff. When the girls were ready to leave, apparently, the Americans refused to pay.
I guess these soldier or sailors or Marines don&amp;rsquo;t watch enough movies. They&amp;rsquo;d know how hookers act when they don&amp;rsquo;t get paid.</description>
