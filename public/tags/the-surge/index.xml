      <description>As I predicted last week, the Democrats have hired the Associated Press to make up stories that discredit the success of the surge.
Last week, as good new about the surge was cresting, the AP treated as fact an opinion piece that the &amp;ldquo;body count&amp;rdquo; in Iraq had doubled since the surge began.
Today, AP customers are leading with another AP opinion piece claiming that August was one of the bloodiest months since the Iraq war began.</description>

      <title>Iranians in Iraq</title>

      <description>Apparently, an Iranian army special forces unit is in Iraq training Shiite militias on the more effective methods of killing Americans. You&amp;rsquo;ll be pleased to know that the US is &amp;ldquo;tracking&amp;rdquo; them.
My question is, Why aren&amp;rsquo;t we killing them? The Kurds are, according this story at Gateway Pundit.
They are enemy combatants in an American occupation zone. We need answer to no one for eliminating this problem.
This points to my whole problem with the way the Bush administration has handled Iraq.</description>
