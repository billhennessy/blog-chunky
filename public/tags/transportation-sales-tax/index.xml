      <description>Now that Amendment 7 has gone down in flames, let&amp;rsquo;s look at highway funding in Missouri.
Amendment 7 would have authorized a 3/4 cent sales tax increase in Missouri. The money was intended for transportation in the broadest sense of the word. Parks with dirt paths qualify, since people can walk on the paths. Even if the bill tightened down the definition of transportation, municipalities and counties would have merely shifted funds to other projects and replaced that money with Amendment 7 taxes.</description>

      <description>Last week I blogged that Ronald Reagan would love the Transportation Empowerment Act (TEA). I included audio of Reagan talking to Bill Buckley on Firing Line about the burden on states from onerous federal taxes and grants.
Forgive me, but that was sort of a tease. Here&amp;rsquo;s the meat: Reagan wrote a proposal for the Republican Governors&amp;rsquo; Conference of 1967 to allow states to keep about 2 percent of all federal taxes raised in the state.</description>

      <description>Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it suck when Jay Nixon and Francis Slay get on opposite sides of an issue?
Where do we go?
They&amp;rsquo;re on opposite sides of Amendment 7, the largest tax increase in Missouri history. And you need to choose a side before August 5, because the ball&amp;rsquo;s in the voters&amp;rsquo; court.
But there&amp;rsquo;s no need to fear; Hennessy is here. And I heard Francis the talking Mayor on KMOX this morning (or maybe it was yesterday) talking about how much he loves, Loves, LOVES the 3/4 cent sales tax increase theoretically for transportation.</description>
