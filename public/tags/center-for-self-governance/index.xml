      <description>Ben Evans worked hard to host a joint event with St. Louis Tea Party Coalition and Heritage Foundation a couple years ago.
Because of Ben&amp;rsquo;s hard work, we met Dottie.
Then the trouble in Ferguson happened last August. Fearless Dottie joined our band of BUYcotters who went to Ferguson to shop while the city still smoldered.
We met Dellena.
Dottie cultivated a relationship with Dellena.

      <description>I just finished Level 1 Training with the Center for Self-Governance. While I have a long way to go to complete the training, I can tell you I needed this. Bad.
What I Didn’t Know I Didn’t Know It’s not that I was stupid before. And some of the political action I’ve been doing my whole adult life was affective, I learned.
The problem is, I didn’t know whether or not it was effective.</description>
