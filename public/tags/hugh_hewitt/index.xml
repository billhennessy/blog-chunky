      <description>The headline would have read, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re Gaining in Iraq,&amp;rdquo; but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to confuse any liberals for whom the &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; in Iraq is al Qaeda.
The surge is working according two liberals from the Brookings Institute writing in the New York Times. And according to Dean Barnett blogging on HughHewitt.townhall.com, their former friends on the left are ready to do to them what it appears Chuck Schumer did to the Chief Justice.</description>

      <description>If Hugh Hewitt is right, the distinction goes to Barack Obama for promising to meet the leaders of &amp;ldquo;Iran, Syria, Cuba, Venezuela and North Korea without precondition.&amp;rdquo;
Huh.
Didn&amp;rsquo;t Jimmy Carter promise something like that in 1976? Except then it was China, the Soviet Union, East Germany, and the Grand Dutchy of Fenwick.
This gaff (is that how to spell &amp;ldquo;gaff?&amp;quot;) came during the YouTube debate, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch. I actually have avoided everything about it, but I stumbled onto Hugh Hewitt and had to giggle.</description>
