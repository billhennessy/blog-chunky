      <description>The Sun Online carries the story of new British Prime Minister Gordon Brown&amp;rsquo;s rather effusive praise of George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s leadership.
In his speech, Brown referred to Winston Churchill:
   The Prime Minister vowed to take Winston Churchill’s lead and make Britain’s ties with America even stronger.
  Mr Brown stunned critics by THANKING President Bush for the fight against Islamic extremism, and insisted the UK-US relationship will be his No1 foreign policy priority.</description>

      <description>Peggy Noonan is a great ally and a doubtful foe. She turned, mildly, on Reagan. She has turned on Bush. So what. Her human insights are wonderful, her writing , usually, excellent. She is setting up her pick for 2008 awkwardly.
Bush supporters and detractors, alike, have made much of Ms. Noonan&amp;rsquo;s Friday Opinion Journal column about President Bush. As a fan Peggy&amp;rsquo;s, I was disappointed. One of the hallmarks of conservatism—something that should distinguish us from them—is that we don&amp;rsquo;t eat our own in public.</description>
