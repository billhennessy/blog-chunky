      <description>Another day, another 300 accused predatory priests. When will it end, Lord? When will it end?
This morning, I tried to listen in silence for God&amp;rsquo;s answers to my questions.
What do we say about the news out of Pennsylvania? How do we answer those who taunt and ridicule the Church? How do we settle our anger at the priests and bishops and cardinals who protected the pederasts for decades? How do we reconcile the hideous criminality of those men with the uncountable graces God freely gave them through the many sacraments they&amp;rsquo;ve received?</description>
