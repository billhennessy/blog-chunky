      <description>Conservatism and the Tea Party movement are good for America and good for the world. Moreover, our beliefs, our theory of government, and our principles are good for people. All people. Everywhere.

That said, our marketing to date has been spotty at best and atrocious at worst. We don’t sell ourselves well.
By “marketing,” I don’t mean phoniness or deception. Rather, we must advance those ideas that will do the greatest good or avert the gravest harm.</description>

      <description>Yes, I read that. And I saw that. And somebody told me about that, too.
I see the ridiculous charges leveled by ignorant bigots against the Tea Party. I hear the slander on MSNBC and CNN. I know that Ben Jealous and Nancy Pelosi live on lies about you and me the way vampires live on human blood.
I get it.
My immediate urge when I read or hear this nonsense is anger.</description>
