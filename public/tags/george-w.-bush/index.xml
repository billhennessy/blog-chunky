      <description>Guest Post by Lee A. Presser
My friend Bill Hennessy wrote an excellent 11-12-16 blog analysis of Anglo-American history and how it relates to Mr. Trump’s victory (https://hennessysview.com/2016/11/12/how-the-second-born-twin-can-be-older-than-the-first/). After reading that blog I phoned him to add a tangential thought. Bill suggested I share the thought with you.
It took 561 years (from the Magna Carta to the Declaration of Independence) for the idea of limited government and political equality to infuse itself into Anglo-American culture.</description>

      <description>Consider these numbers:
 * **9.8 million** * &amp;lt;del&amp;gt;**11.6 million **&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt;**16.8 million** * **55%** * **61%**  Between the 2008 and 2012 elections:
 * 9.8 million people died*, 55% of them were reliable Republican voters * [16.8 &amp;lt;del&amp;gt;11.6&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt; million people reached voting age](https://www.civicyouth.org/you-ask-we-answer-16-8-million-new-youth-eligible-to-vote-in-2012/?%3E)--61% of them are semi-reliable Democrat voters    
Between those years, neither the GOP nor conservative leaning organizations did anything significant to deal with this **demographic cliff.</description>
