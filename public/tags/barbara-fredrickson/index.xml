      <description>Conservatism and the Tea Party movement are good for America and good for the world. Moreover, our beliefs, our theory of government, and our principles are good for people. All people. Everywhere.

By “marketing,” I don’t mean phoniness or deception. Rather, we must advance those ideas that will do the greatest good or avert the gravest harm.</description>
