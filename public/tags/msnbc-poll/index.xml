      <description>One of the most popular and most talked about movies of 1993 was Falling Down, starring Michael Douglas, Barbara Hershey, and Robert Duval.
Douglas played William “D-FENS” Foster, an engineer at a defense contractor who has a really bad day. Some described the movie as “an ordinary man at war with the everyday world.”
Foster became an iconic anti-hero for the people who (stealing Bill Clinton’s line)worked hard and played by the rules, yet found themselves at the bottom of the heap in the post-Cold War era of 1993.</description>
