      <description>After the 1998 Rams season, I walked into City Limits bar or Brothers bar or whatever its name was then. It&amp;rsquo;s a strip mall bar in Wildwood. Cindy Schuenke was tending bar, and we started talking about the Rams&amp;rsquo; dismal season. She said they were hopeless, but I disagreed. &amp;ldquo;They are four players away,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;A quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a defensive end.&amp;rdquo;
Later in the year, but before the season, the Rams acquired Trent Green (and Kurt Warner) at QB, Marshall Faulk at RB, Adam Timmermann at offensive guard, and Grant Wistrom moved up to start at defensive end.</description>
