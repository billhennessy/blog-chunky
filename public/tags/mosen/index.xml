      <description>Elect Hawley.
Retire that wicked witch of the swamp McCaskill so you can walk with a little pride, Missouri. I am 100% voting proudly for Josh Hawley for US Senate, and you will too. No need to say more. Vote for Hawley all the way and silently wonder what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t. (There&amp;rsquo;s something wrong. Say a prayer for them.)
I repeat: **Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s for Hawley 100%. **</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll make this short. I have been highly critical of Senator Roy Blunt for a long time. You can search my blog and find many things that bother me about the Blunts, but that&amp;rsquo;s not what this is about.
This post is about whether the US Constitution survives.
This post is about whether that government of the people, by the people, and for the people will perish from the earth.</description>
