      <description>Once upon a time I didn&amp;rsquo;t like Joe LeGrand.
It was 3rd grade. I was in the Epiphany Toppers Drum and Bugle Corps, and Joe was a bugler who stood right in front of me. He kept turning around and giving me dirty looks. So I decided right then and there that I didn&amp;rsquo;t like him.
Joe was a year ahead of me in school. While our lives intersected a lot, we weren&amp;rsquo;t really close.</description>
