      <description>This is part III of a four-part series. Here&amp;rsquo;s partI and part II.
Why Now? Why did Holzer choose last week to out himself? Why show himself now, putting his old boss, John Brunner, in such a bad light? And right before the August 2 primary?
**Holzer has damaged Brunner&amp;rsquo;s reputation and credibility. **And Brunner spent a ton of his own money in the process, including paying $100,000 to the guy who made the video, then squealed about it.</description>

      <description>This is part II of a three-part series. Here&amp;rsquo;s part__I.
That Shadowy Paul Holzer Paul Holzer is a former Navy SEAL Lieutenant Commander and a medical student at Dartmouth in New Hampshire. (Oddly, his bio shows MD, MBA, even though is still in medical school and simultaneously working toward an MBA.) Holzer also runs a biotech 501c3 and a political consulting firm, Draper Sterling LLC. He did some work for Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign, and he was John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s chief of staff last year.</description>

      <description>Why in the world would a political operative who once worked for John Brunner out himself and expose Brunner as either a liar or a patsy two weeks before an election?
 Reggie Lampert: Of course, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to lie on your back for a while but then you can lie from any position, can&amp;rsquo;t you? &amp;ndash;Charade, 1963
 Things just got weirder in Missouri. After the stunning revelation that people associated with John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s campaign did, in fact, produce a false, negative video attacking Eric Greitens, you might be wondering what&amp;rsquo;s going on?</description>
