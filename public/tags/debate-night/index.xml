      <description>I love breaking from convention. I get tired of doing the same things, the same ways for no particular reason. If you&amp;rsquo;d asked me about dropping opening and closing statements from presidential debates, I&amp;rsquo;d have said &amp;ldquo;give it try.&amp;rdquo;
Well, Lester Holt gave it a try.
I want the statements back.
Last night, the debate began with a question and ended with an answer. No opening or closing. Without those framing statements, the whole thing felt like middle music—a name my colleague gave to the music in upscale hotel lobbies that just goes on and on.</description>
