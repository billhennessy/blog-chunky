      <description>Ever come across a text you know, but forgot?
I did recently. This gem of a paragraph leapt off the page and into my mind:
 I believe this nation hungers for a spiritual revival; hungers to once again see honor placed above political expediency; to see government once again the protector of our liberties, not the distributor of gifts and privilege. Government should uphold and not undermine those institutions which are custodians of the very values upon which civilization is founded &amp;ndash; Faith, education and, above all, family.</description>

      <description>Want to know why Net Neutrality is dangerous?
Forget the Constitutional stuff. That&amp;rsquo;s important, but most people don&amp;rsquo;t care. Seriously. As soon as you mention the Constitution or mercantilism, the 99% walk away.
And the remaining 1% already agree with you.
No, the way to scare people about Net Neutrality is this chart from Statista:

      <description>A genius is someone who can hold contrary concepts simultaneously in mind.
What, then, do we call a person who simultaneously argues two contrary concepts?

How ‘bout “demagogue?”
A few weeks ago, Barack Obama told America’s business owners that they are not responsible for their success. “Someone else built that.”
Today, the same Obama told Mitt Romney that there not many people who consider themselves victims.
Does Mr. Obama believe that people in dire straights are not victims of circumstances?</description>

      <description>There are two kinds of people in America: those who grow up to become productive adults, and those who become bureaucrats.
The GSA scandal lit up the 3 Stooges mentality of the &amp;ldquo;men and women&amp;rdquo; who would run every aspect of your life if Obama and his czars get their way.

Jeff Neely&amp;rsquo;s the guy Thomas Jefferson had in mind when wrote:
 He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.</description>

      <description>What the hell’s going on at NYT? First, they do a piece on Andrew Breitbart. Then they warn the world that Taxmageddon will crush the world in 2013, beginning with the USA.

Here&amp;rsquo;s how Business Insider summarized the David Leohardt article:
