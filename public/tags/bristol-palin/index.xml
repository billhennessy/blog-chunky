      <description>Asked about Bristol Palin&amp;rsquo;s pregnancy, Barack Obama firmly stated that children of candidates are &amp;ldquo;off limits,&amp;rdquo; and that anyone in his campaign discussing the matter &amp;ldquo;will be fired.&amp;rdquo;
Outstanding. I watched and heard the interview, and I have no doubt he meant what he said. His vigor was sincere.
As someone who villifies Obama regularly, I owe it to the man when he comes through. This time he did.
I hope his minions listen.</description>
