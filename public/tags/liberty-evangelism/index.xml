      <description>&amp;ldquo;Good luck with your evangelism,&amp;rdquo; my wife said.
We were discussing my plan to become a Catholic Street Evangelist. My first prayer station event is September 16 under the tutelage of a seasoned team leader.
&amp;ldquo;Why do you say it like that?&amp;rdquo; I asked her.
&amp;ldquo;This is kind of a bad time to be out trying to bring people into the Catholic church, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo;
She had a point.
The church has been in sort of a losing streak of late.</description>

      <title>A Night at the Ball Park</title>

      <description>Sometimes things just happen.
As Jim Durbin points out, last night’s St. Louis Tea Party Night at the Ball Game was a total fluke. A mix-up left us with 46 tickets to last night’s Cardinal’s game against Arizona. (Long story.) But this tea party thing that started over a year ago seems to generate its own publicity.

But the real story, to me, is what happened last night. Three incidents vindicated the shift toward more community building work, even if that work comes at the expense of big, boisterous rallies.</description>

      <title>How to Avoid Overconfidence</title>

      <description>Do you worry that conservative grassroots might get overconfident and blow our chance to stop the advance of socialism in America?
I do. I am concerned that we keep repeating the same tactics to the same audiences until both the audience and the actors become . . . well, bored.
When I read stories like this one, that GOP sentiment is at an all-time high, I worry that some on our side might decide they can go back to their regularly scheduled programming.</description>

      <title>How to Win</title>

      <description>Focus.
There. That was easy, wasn’t it?
Focus.
Of the thousands of possible activities and initiatives, choose one.
Our goal is affect the outcome of the 2010 elections. That has not changed since our first tea party in Febuary 2009 with it’s tag line “Repeal the pork . . . or retire!”
They didn’t fix the fiscal problems. We owe it to ourselves to retire them.
But how?
Let’s try this: let’s go out and meet our neighbors and family and friends.</description>

      <title>Why We Must Evangelize Liberty</title>

      <description>Earlier I linked to Glenn Reynolds’s Examiner column about the hard work that lies ahead for Tea Partyers. If you haven’t read that piece, do so after reading this.
At Tea Party marches and rallies, we are surrounded by others who understand and cherish liberty. We know the horrors that occur when a government loses accountability to and, yes, fear of the people they govern. Such regimes become murderous, intolerant, and repressive.</description>
