      <description>Say what you want about Donald Trump, the customer service at his properties is insanely great. And The Donald personally sets the standard for that service. He also inspects it, and he has a sick level of attention to detail. Donald Trump doesn&amp;rsquo;t miss a thing when it comes to providing a perfect environment for his guests and residents.
The opposite is true of the TSA. Like most government-run operations, the TSA sucks at customer service.</description>
