      <description>Imaginations can run wild in the affinity bubble.
I was in Washington, DC, over the weekend when it dawned on me that we on the right were probably wrong about Obama&amp;rsquo;s thirst for dictatorial power. Or maybe we were right, but seven years of near-dictatorial power have exhausted the would-be autocrat. He certain looks worn down, as this Time magazine side-by-side shows:

      <title>Yes, the Government Should Fear the People</title>

      <description>Every inch of US territory is a Constitutionally guaranteed free-speech zone. I am all for arresting and prosecuting without mercy any government employee&amp;ndash;including military&amp;ndash;who attempt to limit the size or scope of this zone.

During the Bundy Ranch standoff in Nevada, the Bureau of Land Management set up &amp;ldquo;free-speech zones.&amp;rdquo; I prefer to call them &amp;ldquo;First Amendment pens.&amp;rdquo;
The government uses these pens to segregate people. The US government says, &amp;ldquo;If you want to speak your mind, you may do so only within the pen.</description>
