      <description>Face it: you don’t have that many friends. Not that you can rely on, anyway.
On the bright side, you don’t really need friends, do you? You’re a rock star in your own small way. Who made the varsity swim team? You did. Who made honor rolls and deans’ lists? You did. Who landed your job and got the bonus? You did.
With friends like yourself, who needs friends?
If you make 20 times as much as the next guy in line at Target, who cares?</description>
