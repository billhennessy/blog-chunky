Amanda Mateo&amp;rsquo;s door did indeed have balloons on it. A big plastic wreath with fake balloons. As if Martha Stewart went to work for Fischer-Price.
&amp;ldquo;Hello, again,&amp;rdquo; Amanda said as she opened the door.
&amp;ldquo;How did you know it was safe to open the door?&amp;rdquo; Mike asked.
&amp;ldquo;I looked through the hole, silly. I&amp;rsquo;m not stupid.&amp;rdquo;
Amanda stepped back, and Mike walked into her apartment. Brand new everything.</description>

Michael Francis Franklin walked into his San Jose home at six thirty-seven on November 18, 2016. In his hands were a dozen envelopes and ads from his mailbox. On his mind was Amanda Mateo.
Franklin was married from 1999 to 2006. He could remember about an hour and a half of being happily married. The rest was torture. In the decade since his divorce, Mike had come to accept that he was meant to be alone.</description>

      <description>Roger Thompson had completed his checklist. He’d learned from Jack Murphy, his friend and attorney, that the police sergeant seemed cooperative.
With his tasks out of the way, he knew it was time to deal with his wife, Natalie.
Natalie and Roger didn’t see eye to eye politically. Natalie described herself as a progressive. Even though they rarely discussed politics, Roger knew Natalie was politically active before they got married. She worked a lot of referendum campaigns in college and after.</description>

      <description>Chapter Nine “Elizabeth, I’m going to be out of the building the rest of the day. You have my cell. Vice-principal Johnson is in his office.”
Elizabeth had a mouthful of Goldfish and could only grunt. But she wrote a note herself and nodded furiously at her boss.
Nancy Flanders left the building.
Forty-two minutes later, Flanders was parked and walking into the lobby of modern, glass and stainless steel building.</description>
