      <description>I campaigned for and voted for Donald Trump. I stand 100% behind Trump today.
I support Trump because he&amp;rsquo;s a fighter. He&amp;rsquo;s a man of action. Trump prosecutes his causes, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t navel gaze.
Jeff Sessions is a good man. He&amp;rsquo;s a good Washington man. He has standards of decorum. Standards I admire.
Trump has no standards of decorum. But I voted for Trump because history has made decorum a liability, even a vice.</description>

      <description>You had to laugh. Claire McCaskill jumped on Twitter to announce she&amp;rsquo;d never met the Russian ambassador to the US. Before that, she jumped on Twitter to brag about being so damned important and vital that the Russian ambassador sought her oracle-like guidance.
After people mocked and scorned her silly lie, Claire McCaskill made up more lies to cover the first lie. You know, like a liar.
Senator McCaskill believes Jeff Sessions should resign for not telling a lie.</description>
