      <description>This is the most important documentary of the decade.
https://youtu.be/X_AyP9SAEJc  What can you do? Start close to home.
Don&amp;rsquo;t tolerate intolerance. Don&amp;rsquo;t curb your tongue. And don&amp;rsquo;t elect whimps to government. Missouri&amp;rsquo;s legislature needs every person with spine it find.
You don&amp;rsquo;t want a mouse in the House.
And Dottie Bailey has no places for safe spaces.
If you live in Wildwood, Eureka, or Pacific areas, vote for Dottie Bailey.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What was the biggest adjustment for you going from the military to the business world?&amp;rdquo;
Several people have asked me that question, and my answer always surprises them.
&amp;ldquo;In the military,&amp;rdquo; I say, &amp;ldquo;every individual has a lot more latitude and authority to act. In the business world, no one can do anything without explicit instructions.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Really? I thought it would be the other way around,&amp;rdquo; they say.
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s the popular culture, but the truth is one-hundred eighty degrees the other way.</description>
