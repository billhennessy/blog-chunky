      <description>_UPDATE: Originally I mentioned &amp;ldquo;apparently fake twitter account.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve learned (after lots of research) that I was mistaken. I&amp;rsquo;ve removed that statement. Please continue reading. My carelessness was completely my own. _
I agree with Ted Cruz. And welcome Big Government readers.
Senator Cruz said, &amp;ldquo;Katrina Pierson is an utterly fearless principled conservative.&amp;rdquo;
That was just two years ago. Katrina Pierson was challenging Pete Sessions for Congress.
I also agree with Ted&amp;rsquo;s dad, Rafael Cruz, who said of Katrina, &amp;ldquo;She’s a strict constitutionalist.</description>
