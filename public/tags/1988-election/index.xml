      <description>The first time I met George W. Bush in person, I was campaigning for Jack Kemp for President. Kemp was running against Vice President George H. W. Bush (and 47 others) for the Republican nomination. This was 1987.
A wonderful, tough, and tireless local Republican organizer named Thelma Stuart recruited me and served as my mentor in Dixiecrat-style politics of South Carolina. My first gig was manning the Kemp booth at the Low Country Stump Days in Charleston.</description>
