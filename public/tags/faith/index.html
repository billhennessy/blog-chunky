                Why do you stay a Catholic?
Today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel reading comes from John 6. John chapter 6 is all about the bread of life. In it, Jesus shocks his Jewish followers by announcing that they must eat his flesh and drink his blood to achieve eternal life.
When some of his disciples challenged this formula for immortality, Jesus doubled down, saying:
 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.

                It&amp;rsquo;s Friday, and our archbishop in St. Louis has done a great thing. (Maybe today would be a good time to thank a priest. Give him encouragement.) But the town blog used deception to report the story.
Archbishop Robert Carlson of St. Louis asked Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Attorney General, Josh Hawley, to review all of the archdiocese&amp;rsquo;s records regarding abuse cases. Hawley agreed to the Archbishop&amp;rsquo;s request.
Archbishop Carlson deserves our praise and respect for his openness and honesty.

                Happiness Did you know that the word &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;blessed?&amp;rdquo;
Neither did I. But when I heard this on EWTN Radio the other day, I remembered there are two translations of the Beatitudes. One version goes with &amp;ldquo;Blessed are . . .&amp;rdquo; and the other with &amp;ldquo;Happy are . . . .&amp;rdquo; So, I guess it&amp;rsquo;s true. The words are interchangeable.
Happiness, then, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean walking around in some lithium-induced state of bliss.

                My mom and dad have two anniversaries. One anniversary celebrates the day my uncle Bob drove them to Hot Springs, Arkansas to elope. The other celebrates the day about a week later when, having learned of their civil nuptials, my grandfather ordered them to go see Father English and set themselves right with the church.
Like father, like son, I guess. Except, the kid&amp;rsquo;s a lot slower. Fifteen years slower.

                The story Isaac is about tests of faith.
God commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, his only son, born after Abraham and Sarah had given up hope of conceiving.
Once Isaac was bound and placed on the altar, God stayed Abraham&amp;rsquo;s hand. &amp;ldquo;Now I know you fear God.&amp;rdquo;
You know the rest.
It just struck me this morning, listening to the weather during Jamie Allman&amp;rsquo;s show, that Isaac now threatens the GOP convention, dangling above Tampa like Abraham&amp;rsquo;s dagger.

                Today begins Lent.

Lent prepares us for the cycle of mortality and resurrection, perfected by Christ, without which life has no meaning. It’s a time of humility. We call to mind our human brokenness in hopes of making ourselves better imitators of Christ.
On Ash Wednesday, we mark ourselves with the sign of the cross in ashes. **“Remember, man, that you are dust and unto dust you shall return (Genesis 3:19).

                When Barack Obama declared that Catholics must either violate their consciences or face government persecution, he wasn’t going after just Catholics. Nor was he promoting healthcare.
Barack Obama and his myrmidon Kathleen Sebelius tried to erase the First Amendment. They tried to erase religious freedom. They tried to take away yet another foundational liberty that made America America.
And they will try again  &#34;
Unless you stop them.
But how are you going to stop them alone?

My problem was I didn’t want to go to Mass two days in a row.
To give some background, I grew up in a Catholic home. Very Catholic. My dad went to Epiphany. My mom’s Catholic, and her dad converted very late in life. Two of my dad’s cousins were Monsignors.

Missouri House Speaker Steve Tilley (R-Perryville) has signed onto legislation designed to circumvent the Electoral College in presidential elections. Like his position on embryonic stem cell research and the national debt, Tilley seems far out of step with Missouri’s Republican base on this. And this guy wants to be Lt. Governor? Please.
This might be old news to some.
