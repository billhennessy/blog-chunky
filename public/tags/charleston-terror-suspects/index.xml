      <description>The Charleston terrorist story that began last Saturday has not been resolved, but the networks, dailies, and news magazines are keeping it hush-hush. Why? Are they cooperating with the feds in a larger investigation? Or did the DNC or one of the Democrat campaigns ask the media to bury the story? Or do the MSM no longer consider terrorism in the United States newsworthy?
Captain Ed asks some of the same, disturbing questions, and links to other who ask them, as well.</description>
