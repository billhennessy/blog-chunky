      <description>The Gipper didn’t always follow his own commandment.
I’ve appreciated Newt Gingrich’s attitude during the 398 Republican Presidential debates. You know, his approach of refusing to attack his opponents.
He will, necessarily, change that approach a bit on the stump, but it’s been very effective so far. As Gingrich might put it, anyone on this stage will do a better job than Barack Obama.
And he’d be right.
But being right about that doesn’t mean candidates don’t have an obligation to show voters why they’re preferable to their opponents.</description>
