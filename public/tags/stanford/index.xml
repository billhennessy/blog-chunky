      <description>You likely heard about the letter of the girl who was sexually assaulted on Stanford&amp;rsquo;s campus. Two passers-by saw a man molesting an unconscious woman. The man was sentenced to six months in jail and three years&amp;rsquo; probation. Many people were outraged by the sentence, but no one told the woman she needs to do some soul searching, did they?
But why not? Why not ask the woman to reflect on her actions and things she might have said.</description>
