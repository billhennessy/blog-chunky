      <description>I don’t get into town to visit my dad often enough. That’s my loss.
Jack Hennessy, my dad, epitomizes what we call The Greatest Generation.
He helped raise his younger brothers and sister after their mother passed away. Jack was ten. His youngest sibling, my uncle Jim, was a newborn.
Jack Hennessy answered the call of World War II. He was a Machinist’s Mate in the Navy. He answered, again, when North Korea crossed the 34th Parallel.</description>

      <description>Five kids is a lot these days. &amp;ldquo;You have five kids? Oh, my God!&amp;rdquo; people say, their eyes bugged out, mouths wide open.
Even when the oldest were babies, developmental psychologists were advising parent not to tell children &amp;ldquo;no.&amp;rdquo; Their theory was that &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; would teach a child limitation and destroy his curiosity. Instead, offer an alternative. Well, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. But the funny thing is, it&amp;rsquo;s the no &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; advice is totally out of synch with society.</description>
