      <description>Yesterday, Lee Presser made a great point in this guest post, The Only Rule of Engagement Will Be Victory. As one commenter noted:
 This is the best analysis of the war on terror that I have read. If we do not fight to win, we shouldn’t be in the fight. Winning the war on terror starts with 1) admitting there is a war on terror, 2) being willing to confront the enemy with force, 3) fighting to win the war rather than appease the enemy, and 4) do whatever it takes to protect Americans and their homeland.</description>

      <description>Guest Post by Lee Presser
When FDR sent the troops to fight World War 2, he sent them to win. Since 1945, the political class has not given America’s military that clear instruction when being sent to war. Political considerations have modified the goal of winning. In Korea, it was fight but do not anger the Chinese. In Viet Nam, it was fight but do not attack the enemy if they are standing on the other side of line drawn on a map.</description>

      <title>Am I Crazy If I Don&#39;t Believe the President?</title>

      <description>John McCain and John Boehner believe him.
John Kerry believes him.
Nancy Pelosi, too.
But I don&amp;rsquo;t.
I don&amp;rsquo;t believe the US has irrefutable, indisputable proof that the Syrian government intentionally killed 1,500 people with sarin gas.
I don&amp;rsquo;t believe it.
Not yet.
And neither does Yossef Bodansky.
You&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking &amp;ldquo;this Bodansky guy&amp;rsquo;s some conspiracy kook, too.&amp;rdquo;
Here&amp;rsquo;s Bodansky&amp;rsquo;s Wikipedia header:
 Yossef Bodansky (born in Israel) is an Israeli-Americanpolitical scientist who served as Director of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare of the US House of Representatives from 1988 to 2004.</description>
