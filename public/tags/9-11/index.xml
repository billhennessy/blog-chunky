      <description>Have you been watching the 9-11 anniversary programs?
I have. They remind me of several things. My Uncle Patrick Mahon, for one. Uncle Pat and I watched M_A_S*H reruns every day at 4:00 when I was a kid. We met at my Aunt Mame’s house (unwed sister to Pat and my mom). Uncle Pat drank coffee—usually black with sugar—and smoked unfiltered cigarettes.
Uncle Pat retired from the St. Louis Fire Department in about 1976 (rough guess).</description>
