      <description>Things are getting bad for Hillary.
I hear she&amp;rsquo;s losing a lot of support from Democrat Party insiders, at least in private. The DNC is meeting this week, and talk will likely surround an alternative Democrats can vote for.
While Republicans enjoy the Clinton meltdown, we might want to be careful what we wish for.
One of the GOP&amp;rsquo;s best hopes for the White House is voter enthusiasm. Republicans can&amp;rsquo;t wait to vote, Democrats dread it.</description>

      <description>“Shellacked!”
That was the word that stuck out to me.
Eric Cantor, the Republican House Majority Leader led by 34 points according to his pollster. He lost by 10. That’s a shellacking.
Eric Cantor was the first sitting House Majority Leader ever knocked off in a primary. Cantor was also one of Wall Street’s best friends and the embodiment of crony capitalism—the disease eating the heart out of the GOP.</description>

      <description>I agree with Republican Senator Corker that inflation is a danger in the future. But inflation doesn’t win the hearts and minds of most Americans right now. No one’s worried about it except economists and economics geeks.
The death of the community and regional bank, however, does bother people. As does the printing of money that goes straight into the 5 biggest banks in history . . . and stays there.</description>

      <description>Cambridge, MA—Massachusetts Democratic Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren donned a pink headdress and performed, what she called, an “authentic Indian rain dance” during a press conference today. Ms Warren was hoping to convince skeptics of her claims of Native American heritage. She also hinted that her preference for bison meat to beef indicates her heritage.
“My pepaw taught me this dance when I was a little girl,” Warren said during a short session with reporters at a high school gymnasium in Cambridge, MA.</description>

      <title>Is Glenn Beck Helping?</title>

      <description>For (at least) the past two nights, Glenn Beck’s program has been spell-bindingly depressing and eye-gougingly infuriating. He’s chronicled the Obama administration’s anti-Constitutional transfer of power and wealth from private Americans to other countries. He’s shown that the administration has no concern over the 2010 election because it has no intention of obeying the laws passed by Congress.

For example, the newly appointed Consumer Protection Czar, a hard-line communist, Elizabeth Warren, is funded directly from the U.</description>
