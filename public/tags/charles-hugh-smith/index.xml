      <description>When you&amp;rsquo;ve stated your opinion or belief about something important, do you defend your belief to the hilt? Or do you immediately begin questioning your own conclusions?

I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get better, though. One practice I&amp;rsquo;ve developed and recommend to everyone is pretty simple but difficult.</description>
