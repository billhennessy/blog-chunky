      <description>Often, the best outcome seems less satisfying than alternatives.

Daniel Kahneman is a psychologist who won a Nobel in economics for Prospect Theory, more commonly called Behavioral Economics. In his book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman describes a cognitive bias that leads people to make the wrong choice on automobiles. But the bias might actually keep gasoline consumption high by fooling people with number.
Say you’re concerned with the amount of gasoline you use.</description>

      <description>You can&amp;rsquo;t beat the truth, folks.
Environmentalist Bette Midler (who, I think, is related to Barbara Streisand) faces state charges in Hawaii for illegally killing more than 200 trees on her estate.  The staff of the Board of Land and Natural Resources recommended $6,500 in fines for having the trees felled and for building a graded road without permits required for the land zoned for conservation use.
 Of course, she had the trees clear-cut in order to improve the environment, or so her publicist claims.</description>
