      <description>So many people say it&amp;rsquo;s okay for Antifa to beat people they don&amp;rsquo;t like. Tim Cook says it. Mitt Romney says it. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to agree with them. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to say, &amp;ldquo;I hate racists and Nazis. I&amp;rsquo;m glad somebody&amp;rsquo;s taking the initiative and beating them with clubs.&amp;rdquo;
Many people feel that way. Many people feel it&amp;rsquo;s good and just to beat and maim wicked people. Especially people who hold wicked beliefs.</description>
