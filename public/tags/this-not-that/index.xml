About the Real Conservative National Committee
 The Real Conservatives National Committee is a political action committee organized under Section 527 of the IRS Code. We only endorse and support conservative Republican candidates. We do not support third party candidates. We will operate as an independent expenditure SUPER PAC as defined by the Federal Election Commission.
Our mission is to help conservative candidates win Republican primary elections against incumbent RINOs, and help conservative Republicans win general elections against Democrats.</description>
