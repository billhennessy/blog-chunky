      <description>We got to keep an eye on the battle that we face: The war on Tea Partiers. And you see it everywhere, it is the Unions. And you know, there is only one way to beat and win that war. The one thing about Tea Party people is we like a good fight. And you know what? They&amp;rsquo;ve got a war, they got a war with us and there&amp;rsquo;s only going to be one winner.</description>

      <description>Interesting. Mounting evidence suggests [the White House may have been complicit](If so, even Democrats in Congress would be forced to open impeachment investigations) in SEIU’s terrorism (as defined by U.S. Patriot Act) of a banker’s teenage son.

Quit the SEIU. No decent person would belong to an organization that openly, and with the federal government’s approval, uses terrorism to get its way.
Quit the DC Metro Police Force. The President is using you to promote domestic terrorism.</description>
