      <description>If you read my blog, you know I&amp;rsquo;ve had differences with Senator Ted Cruz. But the Senator has stepped up. Bigly! Only a gentleman would do what Cruz just did with his El Chapo bill.
Remember the GOP race? Cruz and Trump went at each other like nobody&amp;rsquo;s business. Wives and all. While Cruz couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring himself to endorse Trump at the convention, Ted has stepped up a lot since the election.</description>

      <description>Pope Francis said today that Donald Trump is not a Christian.
I can only assume the Pope has secretly cut a deal with The Donald.
&amp;ldquo;Pope. Donald here. I need you to give me some crap about the wall.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Si.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Just, uh, call me a Muslim or something. Make it look sincere, ya know?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Si.&amp;rdquo;
So the Pope stands at the U.S.-Mexico border and says anyone who wants to build a wall &amp;ldquo;is not a Christian.</description>
