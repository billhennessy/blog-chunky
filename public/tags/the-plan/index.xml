      <description>A great colleague and I invented something in 2010. It was a two-day workshop for companies. It has been incredibly successful.
In that workshop, we cite a lot of behavioral science research. We also point out that some behavioral science research is bogus. Up to 60 percent by a recent study (which might have been bogus itself.) So how do you know good science from bad?
Look for consistency. I&amp;rsquo;ll give you an example.</description>

Lawrence was the leader of a group seven deacons whose mission was to distribute alms to the poor.</description>
