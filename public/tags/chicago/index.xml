      <description>President Trump (who, by the way, has accomplished more in two days than Obama did in eight years) saw Chicago&amp;rsquo;s horrific crime statistics and warned the mayor and the governor to get to work or he&amp;rsquo;ll fix it himself. Seventy-five percent of murder victims in Chicago are black.
Immediately, leftists, who apparently enjoy all the carnage in Chicago, attacked Trump&amp;rsquo;s call for fewer shootings and murders.
Think of that. LIBERALS WANT MORE MURDER!</description>

      <description>Why did murder skyrocket in Chicago as soon as Rahm Emanuel became mayor? Why have Americans become nastier and meaner since Barack Obama became president?

As Michael Dukakis told us, a fish rots from the head down. Obama surrounds himself with people who thrive on decay and death.
After four years, Obama has nothing to say for himself. Nothing. He can only cut and attack and lie and sneer and mock like a high school bully.</description>
