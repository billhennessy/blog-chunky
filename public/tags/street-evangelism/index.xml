      <description>&amp;ldquo;Good luck with your evangelism,&amp;rdquo; my wife said.
We were discussing my plan to become a Catholic Street Evangelist. My first prayer station event is September 16 under the tutelage of a seasoned team leader.
&amp;ldquo;Why do you say it like that?&amp;rdquo; I asked her.
&amp;ldquo;This is kind of a bad time to be out trying to bring people into the Catholic church, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo;
She had a point.
The church has been in sort of a losing streak of late.</description>
