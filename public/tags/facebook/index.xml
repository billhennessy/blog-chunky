      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to pare back our addiction to social media, and I will propose an alternative later in this post.
Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are the primary causes of unhappiness, anger, tribalism, and violence in America and many other countries. Text messaging apps are accessories.
Heavy Facebook Users Are Miserable and Lonely Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport available on Amazon.
  Replicated research shows that the top 1/4 of Facebook users are three times as angry and depressed as the bottom 1/4.</description>

Twitter and Facebook and Google are trying to remove all conservatives from their social media platforms. So many people come to this blog by clicking links on those platforms, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid you will never know when I&amp;rsquo;m posting unless you subscribe now.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep you informed and entertained.</description>

Ed Martin&amp;rsquo;s opponent doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to realize that the job of Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Attorney General is to represent our state. The AG isn&amp;rsquo;t just some high-ranking prosecutor.</description>

      <description>The Romney Campaign today reminded me of the McCain Campaign of 2008.
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty good at ignoring bogus, fraudulent polls like the one CNN released tonight. In that poll, CNN announced a massive 52-46 national lead for Obama. If true, the race would be all but over.
CNN, of course, cooked the books on this one.
About one-third of voters describe themselves as independents, CNN sampled only 3% independents for its latest poll.</description>
