      <description>When I was on the USS John C. Calhoun, the XO and I were big Rush fans. We stockpiled Snapple in the outboards of the Ship’s Office just to have a little taste of EIB during our three-month patrols.
That was 1992. Back when this country’s government still held onto some strand of connection to its founding.
That&amp;rsquo;s all gone, now. The United States is a shell of its former self.</description>
