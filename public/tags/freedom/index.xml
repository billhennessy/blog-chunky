      <description>Just a short note to wish my friend Jim a happy birthday.
Jim doesn&amp;rsquo;t know this, but several years ago he planted a seed in my heart that has broken through the crust of the earth and is now starting to bloom. For his birthday, I want him to know how grateful I am for his wisdom.
When Jim was in St. Louis, he helped a great deal in getting the St.</description>

      <description>Does it bother you that people would give up essential freedoms before they’d give up their iPhone?
 While 26 percent of Americans report that they can’t live without their smartphone, only 20 percent of Americans say they can’t live without sex, according to this infographic compiled by FinancesOnline.com, a personal finance website.
 Seriously.
It should bother you. [olympus_highlight color=&#39;yellow]Without essential freedoms, smart phones can be taken away or banned[/olympus_highlight].</description>

      <title>Just Which Freedoms Are We Losing? </title>
      <link>https://hennessysview.com/2014/07/29/just-freedoms-losing/</link>

      <description>I confess.
When I write about freedoms lost, I don&amp;rsquo;t itemize the freedoms. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel too bad, though, because almost no one does. Itemizing sucks.
First, it&amp;rsquo;s hard work. &amp;ldquo;Losing freedom,&amp;rdquo; takes about three seconds to type and less time to read. Listing freedoms,on the other hand, takes that much time just to highlight all the freedoms and click the un-ordered list button. God forbid I find myself working in straight HTML and have to hand-type &amp;quot;</description>

      <title>The Government’s Surrender to Cliven Bundy Destroys Taleb’s Weak Argument for Gun Control</title>

      <description>Events of the past week show the power of the Second Amendment to challenge government tyranny, regardless of the government’s firepower advantage. Let me back up, though.
A Smart Man’s Stupid Argument for Gun Control A year ago, the gun control lobby pumped a Facebook post by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, one of my favorite thinkers.
In his post, Taleb argued that the Second Amendment means nothing because the federal government has massively superior firepower:</description>

      <title>What Would Buckley Do?</title>

      <description>I wanted to be William F. Buckley Jr. All I lacked was his intellect, education, and unique experiences.
Well, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be him. I wanted to be the next one.
Every day, I wrote a 750-word piece. Poorly. I believed that practice would improve my writing.
It didn&amp;rsquo;t.
One day, I realized, as long as I tried to be the next William F. Buckley, I was destined for frustration and failure.</description>

      <description>Are you ready for America’s first Clothing Czar?
According to RightQuestion.org, this person, “will decide what you will wear every day for the next four years.
If you’re a Goth, what if the Czar disallows Goth? What if he’s an 80s fan and orders collars up?
What other questions do you have for the new Clothing Czar?
The good news: you can vote for the Clothing Czar of your choice.</description>

      <description>It was one of the greatest speeches in the history of speaking. It promoted two self-evident goods: freedom and equality.
He spoke first of equality.
 I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: &amp;ldquo;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.&amp;rdquo;
 I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.</description>

      <title>Life As You’ve Known It Is About To Change</title>

      <description>You have a choice. You can drive that change, or you can be swallowed by it.
In a free society, people have liberty to do anything except a few prohibited things.
In a totalitarian society, people have liberty to do nothing except a few permitted things.
In a free society, the people have a black list of things they must not do, and government has a white of a few things it may do.</description>

      <title>Socialism Sucks. Here’s How to Avoid It In America</title>

      <description>Some of the “cool” kids say they like socialism. Of course they have no emotional clue what socialism is.

Maybe they’ve read about socialism, seen the movies, and heard about it from their college professors—ya know, like the one who actually visited the old Soviet Union.
But those sources give only an intellectual view of socialism. You can’t actually _feel _it. And life, in the end, is about feelings.</description>

      <title>Why Not an Annual Celebration of Freedom?</title>

      <description>The first entry in National Review’s “The Week” from sometime around 1990 listed ten or so former Soviet bloc countries that recently had shed the yoke of communist repression. And it made a simple statement:
 “It must be nice to live in a country where you get freer every day.”
 I thought of this while talking about the 13th Amendment Freedom Week with its evangelist-in-chief Kariem Haqq at St.</description>

      <description>When Barack Obama declared that Catholics must either violate their consciences or face government persecution, he wasn’t going after just Catholics. Nor was he promoting healthcare.
Barack Obama and his myrmidon Kathleen Sebelius tried to erase the First Amendment. They tried to erase religious freedom. They tried to take away yet another foundational liberty that made America America.
**And they will try again**
Unless you stop them.
But how are you going to stop them alone?</description>

      <description>A friend of mine told me this story.
 He sat that there bragging about getting a tax cut for friends of his.
I said, ‘you do realize, don’t you, that you’re just like the Democrats, except you’re giving taxpayers money to a different special interest.’
He looked at me and said, ‘but our special interests do good with the money.’
 My friend was talking about the second highest-ranking Republican in the Missouri House at the time.</description>

      <title>NYTimes: Cubans Find Freedom Fun</title>

      <description>Since mass murderer Fidel Castro fired thousands of Cuban government workers due to the economic unviability of Obamanomics, those set free are enjoying their independence. To the shock of the New York Times:
 “I feel useful; I’m independent,” said Ms. Álvarez, who opened a small cafe in November at her home in this scruffy town 25 miles from the capital, Havana. “When you sit down at the end of the day and look at how much you have made, you feel satisfied.</description>

      <title>Israel Continues Assault on Terrorists</title>

      <description>Israel&amp;rsquo;s assault on Hamas terrorists in Gaza continued for a second day. As if reading from a script, the UN Security Council called for an immediate stop to Israel&amp;rsquo;s self-defense. As the air strikes continued, Israel has moved more troops and tanks to the border, possibly in preparation for an incursion into the area now under terrorist control.
Some internation responses were less than predictable, though. France, for instance, demands first that the terrorists stop pitching rockets at Israeli school kids, then that Israel stop its air assault.</description>

      <title>Five Kids and the List of Nos</title>

      <description>Five kids is a lot these days. &amp;ldquo;You have five kids? Oh, my God!&amp;rdquo; people say, their eyes bugged out, mouths wide open.
Even when the oldest were babies, developmental psychologists were advising parent not to tell children &amp;ldquo;no.&amp;rdquo; Their theory was that &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; would teach a child limitation and destroy his curiosity. Instead, offer an alternative. Well, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. But the funny thing is, it&amp;rsquo;s the no &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; advice is totally out of synch with society.</description>
