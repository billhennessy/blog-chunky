                If you read my blog, you know I&amp;rsquo;ve had differences with Senator Ted Cruz. But the Senator has stepped up. Bigly! Only a gentleman would do what Cruz just did with his El Chapo bill.
Remember the GOP race? Cruz and Trump went at each other like nobody&amp;rsquo;s business. Wives and all. While Cruz couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring himself to endorse Trump at the convention, Ted has stepped up a lot since the election.

                I&amp;rsquo;m trying to put my finger on exactly why I found Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s remarks Wednesday night so incredibly distasteful.
The Pledge thing is a goodly part of it.
Simply put, the parties to the Pledge Ted Cruz signed were only Ted Cruz and the RNC (by extension, you can probably include the delegates and voters, too).
The Pledge promised support, including data, from the RNC in exchange for Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s endorsement of the eventual nominee.

Today Cruz proved himself to be Lyin&amp;rsquo; Ted again.
After swearing that his non-endorsement was all about &amp;ldquo;freedom and the Constitution,&amp;rdquo; he admitted today that he broke his oath of support solely because Trump insulted his wife and his father. For Ted, this was personal, not business.
Ted could have told us it was personal last night. But he lied instead. He could have said something else, too.

                You&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking that Ted Cruz made Donald Trump look bad last night. And he did. Ted Cruz had a prime time speaking slot and he failed to endorse his party&amp;rsquo;s nominee for president. Hillary Clinton will use it.
A lot of people are saying Trump shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have invited him to speak unless Cruz agreed to endorse Trump. But Trump didn&amp;rsquo;t even ask for Cruz&amp;rsquo;s endorsement. Trump just offered Ted the prime time spot, and Ted took it.

                In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t hear, Donald Trump invited Ted Cruz to speak at the RNC in prime time with no expectation that Cruz would keep his word by endorsing Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz immediately accepted the prime time speaking spot.
In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t hear, Donald Trump waived his right to review Senator Cruz&amp;rsquo;s speech in advance, the first time that&amp;rsquo;s happened in our lifetimes according to Tucker Carlson. Mr. Trump respects Senator Cruz enough to let the senator say whatever he wants.

                You might have noticed that my predictions have been remarkably accurate lately, have you not?
For example, on Sunday, May 1, I predicted Ted Cruz would suspend his campaign after getting trounced in Indiana. Two days later, Cruz lost the Indiana primary to Donald Trump 53 to 36. At the time I wrote, many pundits and pollster still believed Cruz could win that Indiana race, and everyone believed Cruz was telling the truth when he said repeatedly he was staying in the race to Cleveland unless Trump reached 1,237 delegates before then.

                I have no idea who will win the Indiana primary 72 hours from the time I write. But the people inside Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s campaign seem to have an idea. And it&amp;rsquo;s not good for them. Cruz&amp;rsquo;s top team expects their candidate to lose. And Senator Cruz seems to have accepted that outcome.
Expectations Matter More Than Preferences Regular readers know that polls that ask &amp;ldquo;who do you think will win&amp;rdquo; trump polls that ask &amp;ldquo;who do you intend to vote for&amp;rdquo; or even &amp;ldquo;who did you vote for?

                Ted Cruz has a powerful strategy available to him. This strategy could not only determine the winner of the Republican convention but put Cruz in position to influence policy for generations.
But it&amp;rsquo;s probably not what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to lay out some assumptions, many of which you could disagree with. That&amp;rsquo;s okay. But for the purposes of this post, let&amp;rsquo;s stipulate:
*1. Ted Cruz believes, like Glenn Beck, that Donald Trump would make a worse president than Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, or Bernie Sanders.

                This &amp;ldquo;VOTING VIOLATION&amp;rdquo; controversy says bad things about the Cruz campaign.
(BTW, Rubio&amp;rsquo;s campaign sent a similar, but less creepy, mailer, too. So far, I have not seen a large number of complaints about the Rubio mailer.)
And I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the ethics of publicly shaming people who vote sporadically. I&amp;rsquo;m talking two gross electioneering violations from a campaign that markets itself as the most scientifically advanced in history. With the mailer Team Cruz showed a lack of strategic understanding of the science and compounded their ignorance by apparently making up numbers.
