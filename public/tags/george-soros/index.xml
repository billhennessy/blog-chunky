      <description>For three consecutive days the hard left of American politics executed a prepared battle plan:
 * Personify the Enemy (Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck) * Isolate him or her (Rightwing vitriol, conservative talk radio, “crosshairs”) * Vilify without mercy (Hate, violence, accessory to murder)  Democrat Mark Penn showed us the left’s cards in November when he said that Obama needs an Oklahoma bombing to help him “reconnect” with the American people.</description>

John Mackey of Whole Foods had the courage to oppose socialized medicine AND to defend his position and his right to say it.</description>
