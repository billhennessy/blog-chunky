      <description>Every Constitutional conservative knows there&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as &amp;ldquo;states&amp;rsquo; rights.&amp;rdquo; Only people have rights. Governments have powers. People have the right to grant government powers. Governments have no power to assume powers not granted by the people. Anyone who says &amp;ldquo;states&amp;rsquo; rights&amp;rdquo; needs a basic course in political philosophy.
For years, a few conservatives mistakenly defended &amp;ldquo;states&amp;rsquo; rights&amp;rdquo; when they meant to say &amp;ldquo;federalism.&amp;rdquo; When conservatives made this error, the left jumped all over them.</description>
