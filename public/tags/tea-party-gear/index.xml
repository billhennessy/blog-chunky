      <description>Sorry for the interruption, but we’ve worked out the kinks.
Do you want to show the world your colors?
Do you want to say, “I’m a tea partier?”
Do you want your style to shout, “FREEDOM!”
Then get to the official St. Louis Tea Party store and stock up. We’ve added T.E.A. ball caps to go with the T.E.A Special Forces t-shirts (our best seller).
You’ll look terrific reading Zen Conservatism in your Tea Party Hoodie!</description>
