      <description>The next US President must be a great communicator.
Distilling complex and controversial problems into mental models accessible to large numbers of people is not deception&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s brilliance. The reason we hang onto sound bites isn&amp;rsquo;t because we&amp;rsquo;re stupid&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s because we&amp;rsquo;re busy. We all don&amp;rsquo;t have time to earn masters-degree understanding of every issue facing society and government. Honest, accurate distillations of the complex ideas allow us to choose and act quickly.</description>

      <description>Marine Corps officers eat last.
That simple insight inspired the title of Simon Sinek&amp;rsquo;s latest book, &amp;ldquo;Leaders Eat Last.&amp;rdquo; If I could influence high school or college curricula, no one would graduate without successfully completing a semester course on that principle.
Below is another remarkable video of Simon Sinek discussing how circumstances can override our desire to lead and serve and how leadership and service can fix almost any problem. But first, I&amp;rsquo;d like you think a bit more about these two critical needs: leadership and service.</description>

      <description>Many of you loved Simon Sinek’s Start With Why TEDx talk.
I love the way Simon Sinek thinks. It’s no surprise, then, that his TED Talk on leadership could be the greatest definition of leadership I’ve ever heard.
Please watch and share. I have some thoughts and a poll following. [ted id=1998]
Contrasts give greater clarity. Sinek’s contrast between military leadership and business leadership says a lot about the state of American business.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re still asking &amp;ldquo;why bother?&amp;rdquo; read this.
If you still believe conservatism is an economic theory, read this.
If you&amp;rsquo;re ready to [olympus_highlight color=&amp;quot;yellow&amp;rdquo;]create a transformational social movement that improves lives[/olympus_highlight] by providing every America with the dignity of meaningful work and the freedom to pursue happiness, watch this video. It&amp;rsquo;s Simon Sinek&amp;rsquo;s TEDx talk about his then-new book, Start With Why, and it&amp;rsquo;s the most powerful idea I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered in recent years.</description>

I can think of no better way to accomplish both goals than to liberally borrow from Simon Sinek’s fantastic blog post about that speech and the importance of living your “why.”
 On August 28, 1963, 250,000 people from across the country descended on the Mall in Washington, D.</description>
