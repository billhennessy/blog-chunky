      <description>Governor Nixon:
What does it take to get your attention? What does it take to get you to act?
Your University of Missouri System humiliates this state, and you refuse to act.
Under your nose, the UofM teaches or encourages:
* **[Politically motivated](https://biggovernment.com/publius/2011/04/25/union-official-professor-teach-college-course-in-violent-union-tactics/) violence**** **Politically motivated [industrial sabotage](https://biggovernment.com/publius/2011/04/25/how-to-college-course-on-violent-union-tactics-part-ii-case-studies-edition/)**** **Politically motivated threats of violence and sabotage**** **Supporting and aiding [the enemy in Iraq and Afghanistan](https://biggovernment.com/driehl/2011/04/26/college-course-us-flag-is-racist-how-to-defeat-america-in-iraq-and-afghanistan/)**  You have permit these travesties. You, Jay Nixon.</description>

      <description>[ ](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/UofMCommie.png)Contact UofM President Steve Owens and demand an immediate end to the communist-led industrial sabotage courses that he’s shoving down your kids’ throats
That’s right, UMSL and UMKC are teaching kids how to destroy business in America. They want your job to go overseas. And the guy leading the class is a proud communist.
No employer in his right might would hire a graduate of the University of Missouri-St. Louis.</description>
