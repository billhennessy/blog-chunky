      <description>In a blog I never published for fear of being thought insane, I conveyed a prophecy:
 Many Christians will be accused of crimes against the state for simply following Christ&amp;rsquo;s teachings and believing that Jesus is our lord and savior. When you are accused and at trial, the Holy Spirit will speak through you if you let Him. You won&amp;rsquo;t need to come up with your own defense. Anyone might betray you and cause you to be put to death, even your parents or your children.</description>
