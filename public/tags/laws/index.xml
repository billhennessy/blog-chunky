      <description>Until the clock struck twelve on January 1, that is.
That’s when 40,000 – count ‘em, forty thousand—new laws took effect in the United States.
Some of the new laws are, no doubt, good and proper. Some restore liberties lost. But others bind. And some are silly.
Utah’s banning happy hours. (Why not ban melancholy hours instead?) California now prohibits people 18 and under from using tanning beds. Georgia requires golf carts to have turn signals and horns if driven on public roads.</description>
