      <description>Well, a redneck nerd in a bowling shirt was a-guzzlin&amp;rsquo; lone star beer Talking religion and-uh politics for all the world to hear.

I used to hate to be wrong.
In fact, most of my life, I&amp;rsquo;d deny being wrong long after all doubt had left the room.
I&amp;rsquo;d get angry when I was wrong, too. More accurately, I&amp;rsquo;d get angry when someone found out I was wrong.</description>

      <description>When you&amp;rsquo;ve stated your opinion or belief about something important, do you defend your belief to the hilt? Or do you immediately begin questioning your own conclusions?
Most of my life, I would defend my opinion to the point of losing friends. Even if I was wrong. Even I knew I was wrong. I&amp;rsquo;m a coward, what can I say?
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get better, though. One practice I&amp;rsquo;ve developed and recommend to everyone is pretty simple but difficult.</description>
