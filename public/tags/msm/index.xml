      <description>. . . you have to do it yourself.
That&amp;rsquo;s the MSM&amp;rsquo;s motto over the upcoming Patraeus report to Congress on progress in Iraq.
The facts are obvious: since the surge and offensive began, the terrorists in Iraq have become less effective. The surge and the offensive are working. Those who agree with this view inlude these liberals and Democrats:

      <title>Democrats Combat Surge With Propaganda Campaign</title>

      <description>Just a few days, other bloggers (Captain Ed) and I speculated on the ramifications on Democrat surrender strategies of the increasingly obvious improvements in Iraq since the surge began. Ever the WaPo worried about how the Dems would deal.
Now we know: propaganda.
Following the phony story that Gen. Pace would urge the President to cut troops in Iraq by half, the Red Crescent, today, released a report that a record number of Iraqis have fled their homes in fear of their lives since the surge began.</description>

      <title>Pace Pullout Talk Pack of Lies</title>

      <description>For a couple of days, the wingnuts have been ecstatic over a story that Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Peter Pace would tell President Bush to cut Iraqi troop strength in half. I first heard the story on CBS Radio News Friday morning on my way to work. TheLA Times, quoting anonymous Pentagon and Administration officials, printed the the story in its Friday edition.
But the story was a fabrication, likely designed to quell the growing support for the war.</description>

      <title>MSM Editorials on Rove</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the editorials on the editorial pages, but the remarkably blatant editorializing in the &amp;ldquo;news&amp;rdquo; stories covering Karl Rove&amp;rsquo;s resignation from the White House.
An AP story by Terence Hunt retrieved from news.myway.com begins by describing the whole of the Bush administration as &amp;ldquo;turbulent.&amp;rdquo; Perhaps, but the color of the paragraph indicates that the turbulence was Rove&amp;rsquo;s fault. If blaming Rove was Hunt&amp;rsquo;s intention, then Hunt must believe Rove ordered the Islamofascist hijackers to fly airplanes into buildings.</description>
