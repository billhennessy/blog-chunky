      <description>The will of man is not shattered, but softened, bent, and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy, but it prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, but it compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.</description>

      <description>I was scared. Not afraid to say it.
And some friends turned hostile. They had good reasons. And I was probably a little cavalier. And I talked way too long.
But last September I wanted to start something that would help real people in our neighborhood while advancing liberty and upsetting abusive government. Sure, I&amp;rsquo;d rather upset the federal government in Washington, but my arms are little short to box with Harry Reid.</description>

      <description>I had the rare honor of testifying before the Missouri Senate committee on Economic Development. The hearing&amp;rsquo;s subject was Senator Eric Schmitt&amp;rsquo;s Senate Bill 5 to reign in traffic court abuses in Missouri.
Here&amp;rsquo;s some perspective:
 St. Louis County accounts for 22 percent of Missouri&amp;rsquo;s population and over 50 percent of traffic tickets St. Ann&amp;rsquo;s traffic court revenue exploded from about $500,000 in 2009 to over $3.5 million last year Traffic court generates 90 percent of the total revenue for one Missouri city Ferguson, Missouri, has three outstanding traffic ticket warrants for every citizen The mayor of Edmundson in North St.</description>

What do police officer think about traffic ticket quotas? Here&amp;rsquo;s one officer&amp;rsquo;s thoughts:
 In my agency, those of us in patrol had to keep a &amp;ldquo;Daily.&amp;rdquo; This would be a formal document that showed the times, addresses where we went, written in code, of what we had done.
 On the back were boxes for how many traffic citations, criminal citations, parking citations and felony and misdemeanor arrests we had made on that day.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s something happening here But what it is ain&amp;rsquo;t exactly clear There&amp;rsquo;s a man with a gun over there Telling me I got to beware &amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;For What It&amp;rsquo;s Worth&amp;rdquo; by The Buffalo Springfield
 &amp;ldquo;This isn&amp;rsquo;t about Michael Brown.&amp;rdquo;
Those words popped out of my mouth as I watched the Sunday evening news with my dad. It was August 10.
Full-scale rioting hadn&amp;rsquo;t erupted, but the battle lines were drawn: police on one side, people, mostly young people, on the other.</description>
