      <description>PO’ed Patriot has the story.
Jake Zimmerman’s campaign rotates two themes:
  The St. Louis County Assessor should be a career political hack, not a seasoned real estate professional
  His little old friend, Margaret, is in danger of losing her home.
  But mostly St. Louis County government needs more Democrat political hacks.
Turns out that, just like Jake’s dad, his friend Margaret, a rather unsuccessful real estate investor, got a break on her property taxes.</description>
