I am embarrassed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about this problem sooner. Or I heard about it and ignored it, which is even worse. Maybe I thought it was just the usual liberal whining about trumped up racial problems. Whatever, I should have listened.

                What political label do you give yourself?
Yesterday, I blogged about calling myself a Republican. I was a kid.
Then, from about 1996 on, I called myself a conservative.
Over the past year or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken on the label of libertarian. Now, a simple online test confirms that I&amp;rsquo;m a right-leaning conservative. [Take the test yourself]
That&amp;rsquo;s exciting, because I feel like I need a new label.
Labels Matter I know there was a movement a couple of years ago to abolish political and ideological labels.

How does that thought make you feel? Weak or strong? Impotent or powerful? Eager or dispirited?
Do you know why you feel forced to choose between the lesser of two evils?
Because you want to.
In almost every race, you have more than two choices. In the 2014 US House elections in Missouri, ballots in all eight districts will have a Libertarian or independent candidate, or both.

Yes, I said it: the Missouri Republican legislature is about as conservative and principled as Susan Rice on a Sunday talk show.
By going on a votes-for-cash spending spree on the last day of the General Assembly, the House and Senate handed Jay &amp;ldquo;Idiot&amp;rdquo; Nixon a PR prize worth its weight in pork.

                I can be pretty hard on Republicans. Not hard enough for some. Too hard for others.
But I, at least, try to time my battles for ideological consistency. As a general rule, odd-numbered years are for cleaning up the GOP. Even-numbered years are for cleaning out Democrats.
This is an odd-numbered year. Right up to the votes on the continuing resolution,my primary targets were Republicans, especially Roy Blunt.
Once the House exercised its Constitutional power of the purse strings, sending a popular continuing resolution to the Senate, the battle lines shifted.

RINO stands for &amp;ldquo;Republican In Name Only.&amp;rdquo; Rhinos and Elephants are both pachyderms, so it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty clever name for people who join the Republican Party but prefer the Democrat platform.
The problem is, some people take the concept to extremes.

WWII Veterans asked the White House for permission to visit the World War II Memorial in case of a shutdown. The veterans are part of the Honor Flights program that helps aging veterans visit the WWII Memorial.
Even though there&amp;rsquo;s no cost involved, the White House chose to dishonor the veterans&amp;rsquo; request. It send forth &amp;ldquo;goons,&amp;rdquo; in Senator Paul&amp;rsquo;s works, to erect barricades around the memorial.

                I was wrong.
As the continuing resolution fight approached, I expected House Republicans to cave. I expected Boehner to make a half-hearted attempt to use debt ceiling, instead of continuing resolution, as leverage to stop Obamacare. And I expected Republican Senators to make a stand.
But that&amp;rsquo;s not what happened.
In reverse order, Senate Republican leadership ran away from confrontation like schoolgirls spying a snake. Led by Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, and Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Junior Senator Roy Blunt, the GOP attacked Senators Mike Lee and Ted Cruz instead of Obamacare.

                A commenter to my blog about libertarian kids implies that libertarians are okay—as long as they’re not, ya know, too libertarian.
The other night at Heritage Tavern I heard debates break out over the definition of “conservative.”
If you’re wondering why the left is kicking our ass, now you know. They’re busy turning Texas blue while we debate the meanings and merits of political labels.
Maybe this country is beyond hope.

                Jennifer Rubin—WaPo’s token conservative—said it perfectly:
 McCain lost his cool with Rand Paul and sounded like the old man down the street screaming to the new kids on the block, “Get off my lawn!”
 The real reason McCain and Lindsey Graham embarrassed themselves on the floor of Senate had nothing to do with what Rand Paul said. Rand Paul&amp;rsquo;s ideas terrify McCain, Graham, and most of the Republican establishment.

                John McCain doesn&amp;rsquo;t want the Republican Party to outlive him.
He&amp;rsquo;s afraid. Afraid that, after he&amp;rsquo;s gone, his political widow will remarry someone younger, sexier, more fun.
Thursday, March 7, 2013: Senate Office Building, Washington, DC In the dark cloisters of his Senate office, McCain leans back in his chair, tie loosened, jacket tossed casually over a guest chair, fingers interlaced behind his white head, and broods.
He sees those rascally young libertarians&amp;ndash;the ones who actually want to own their own lives&amp;ndash;plunging into the party.

                Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) generates more internet press than all the other candidates combined, it seems. His name has been on Technorati&amp;rsquo;s most-searched list for a couple weeks, rivaling Paris Hilton and YouTube for search popularity endurance. Whether or not his fledgling campaign for President will so endure is another matter.
Rummaging through the odd blog with a Ron Paul theme, I found some common characteristics among his supporters:
 * Young * Typically apolitical * Technology careers * Homosexual * Educated * Atheist * Decent writing skills * No particular axe to grind  I know many who fit the type, particularly working in the software industry.
