      <description>There is a tide in the affairs of men. Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves, Or lose our ventures.
 Julius Caesar Act 4, scene 3, 218–224
 The problem the Republican Party has, too many people are sitting around, waiting for a wave to take them across the election.</description>

      <title>Why Municipal Courts Matter to Liberty</title>

      <description>I am embarrassed.
I am embarrassed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about this problem sooner. Or I heard about it and ignored it, which is even worse. Maybe I thought it was just the usual liberal whining about trumped up racial problems. Whatever, I should have listened.
On September 2, I asked a room of about 30 tea partiers, &amp;ldquo;Do you trust our justice system?&amp;rdquo; I heard a chorus of &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <title>7 Fascinating Results In The Missouri Primary</title>

      <description>CORRECTION: My sincerest apologies for an inexcusable error in this post earlier. I erroneously congratulated my friend Martin Baker in the US House 1st District primary. I understand that Martin was about 500 votes short. I failed to verify information I received on the race, and I apologize for my irresponsibility.
Well, this got people talking. (See the comments.)
Yesterday was the Missouri Primary. Congratulations to Rick Stream and Jay Ashcrofton their wins in contested races for St.</description>

      <title>Libertarian Is The New Mainstream</title>

      <description>You don&amp;rsquo;t hear the word &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; in political spin like you used to.
Back in the late 1980s when Jack Kemp, Pat Robertson, Pete DuPont, Al Haig, and George H. W. Bush were battling to replace
[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_15090&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;rdquo;] 1988 Republican Candidates[/caption]
Ronald Reagan, &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; was in. Candidates fought for the title of &amp;ldquo;mainstream Republican,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;mainstream Conservative,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;mainstream everything.&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;m glad that word went away. But I&amp;rsquo;m bringing it back, if only for one blog post.</description>

      <title>I Am a Right-Leaning Libertarian</title>

      <description>What political label do you give yourself?
Yesterday, I blogged about calling myself a Republican. I was a kid.
Then, from about 1996 on, I called myself a conservative.
Over the past year or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken on the label of libertarian. Now, a simple online test confirms that I&amp;rsquo;m a right-leaning conservative. [Take the test yourself]
That&amp;rsquo;s exciting, because I feel like I need a new label.
Labels Matter I know there was a movement a couple of years ago to abolish political and ideological labels.</description>

      <title>10 Missouri Candidates No One Told You About</title>

      <description>How many times have you thought, &amp;ldquo;I really don&amp;rsquo;t care for the Republican, but I&amp;rsquo;ll never vote for a Democrat?&amp;rdquo;
How does that thought make you feel? Weak or strong? Impotent or powerful? Eager or dispirited?
Do you know why you feel forced to choose between the lesser of two evils?
Because you want to.
In almost every race, you have more than two choices. In the 2014 US House elections in Missouri, ballots in all eight districts will have a Libertarian or independent candidate, or both.</description>

      <title>How Missouri Republicans Made Jay Nixon Look Like a Statesman</title>

      <description>You know how reckless and tone-deaf Obama is about Army deserters? Missouri&amp;rsquo;s House and Senate Republican leaders are just as clueless and irresponsible about money.
Yes, I said it: the Missouri Republican legislature is about as conservative and principled as Susan Rice on a Sunday talk show.
By going on a votes-for-cash spending spree on the last day of the General Assembly, the House and Senate handed Jay &amp;ldquo;Idiot&amp;rdquo; Nixon a PR prize worth its weight in pork.</description>

      <title>Know When To Fight Your Own</title>

      <description>I can be pretty hard on Republicans. Not hard enough for some. Too hard for others.
But I, at least, try to time my battles for ideological consistency. As a general rule, odd-numbered years are for cleaning up the GOP. Even-numbered years are for cleaning out Democrats.
This is an odd-numbered year. Right up to the votes on the continuing resolution,my primary targets were Republicans, especially Roy Blunt.
Once the House exercised its Constitutional power of the purse strings, sending a popular continuing resolution to the Senate, the battle lines shifted.</description>

      <title>How to Avoid Collateral Damage When Hunting for RINOs</title>
      <link>https://hennessysview.com/2013/10/06/responsible-rino-hunter/</link>

      <guid>https://hennessysview.com/2013/10/06/responsible-rino-hunter/</guid>
      <description>Lowell Weicker was a RINO. So was Lincoln Chaffe for a while. And John Linsday, the mayor who tried to destroy New York City in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
RINO stands for &amp;ldquo;Republican In Name Only.&amp;rdquo; Rhinos and Elephants are both pachyderms, so it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty clever name for people who join the Republican Party but prefer the Democrat platform.
The problem is, some people take the concept to extremes.</description>

      <title>Here&#39;s the Most Encouraging Thing John Boehner Ever Said</title>

      <description>Today on ABC&amp;rsquo;s This Week, Speaker of the House John Boehner spoke very powerful words about himself. They reveal his motivation. And it&amp;rsquo;s very encouraging.
 &amp;ldquo;I’m a reasonable guy. But I didn’t come to Washington to be a congressman. I came to do something for my country.&amp;rdquo;
 Write that down. That statement echos.
Research shows thatpeople motivated by doing, by getting better, by learning, will work harder and stay truer to their principles than people motivated by demonstrating how good they are&amp;ndash;being something.</description>

      <title>4 Reasons Why House Republicans Should Pass a Clean Debt Ceiling Bill Now *UPDATE*</title>

      <description>Yeah, I know. Obama&amp;rsquo;s childish, petulant, and tyrannical tantrums over the continuing resolution makes me want to fight like an angry cat, too.
But I don&amp;rsquo;t actually want to fight. Fighting isn&amp;rsquo;t in our interest. As Sun Tzu said:
 Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy&amp;rsquo;s resistance without fighting.
 I want to succeed in repealing Obamacare and forcing government into its constitutionally limited box.</description>

      <title>Obama&#39;s Loathsome War on WWII Vets Deserves Our Scorn and Fury</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve all see the reports.
WWII Veterans asked the White House for permission to visit the World War II Memorial in case of a shutdown. The veterans are part of the Honor Flights program that helps aging veterans visit the WWII Memorial.
Even though there&amp;rsquo;s no cost involved, the White House chose to dishonor the veterans&amp;rsquo; request. It send forth &amp;ldquo;goons,&amp;rdquo; in Senator Paul&amp;rsquo;s works, to erect barricades around the memorial.</description>

      <title>Shutdown Week Could Turn Into Big Win for Republicans</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to offer anything.&amp;rdquo; Barack Obama on why he&amp;rsquo;s shutting down the government.
Obama keeps forgetting he&amp;rsquo;s not a dictator. Or maybe I keep forgetting he is.
[caption id=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;441&amp;rdquo;] Democrat Speaker Tip O&amp;rsquo;Neill shut down the government 12 times.[/caption]
Did you see that list of government shutdowns?
1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1990, 1995.
Those first four shutdowns came with Democrat majorities in both houses of Congress.</description>

      <title>I&#39;ve Learned the House GOP Is A Lot Tougher Than Senate</title>

      <description>I was wrong.
As the continuing resolution fight approached, I expected House Republicans to cave. I expected Boehner to make a half-hearted attempt to use debt ceiling, instead of continuing resolution, as leverage to stop Obamacare. And I expected Republican Senators to make a stand.
But that&amp;rsquo;s not what happened.
In reverse order, Senate Republican leadership ran away from confrontation like schoolgirls spying a snake. Led by Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, and Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Junior Senator Roy Blunt, the GOP attacked Senators Mike Lee and Ted Cruz instead of Obamacare.</description>

      <description>What do we look like to people who aren&amp;rsquo;t politics wonks? And why does it matter?
This question is for my friends on the right. By &amp;ldquo;on the right,&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m talking about conservatives and right-leaning libertarians. (I&amp;rsquo;m not going to debate definitions, so accept mine or stop reading.)
Developing a Third Eye When I was an acting student many long years ago, I had a director, Don Garner, who stressed the importance of the actor&amp;rsquo;s third eye.</description>

      <description>A commenter to my blog about libertarian kids implies that libertarians are okay—as long as they’re not, ya know, too libertarian.
The other night at Heritage Tavern I heard debates break out over the definition of “conservative.”
If you’re wondering why the left is kicking our ass, now you know. They’re busy turning Texas blue while we debate the meanings and merits of political labels.
Maybe this country is beyond hope.</description>

      <title>Why Libertarian Kids, Not Drones, Scare McCain and Graham</title>

      <description>Jennifer Rubin—WaPo’s token conservative—said it perfectly:
 McCain lost his cool with Rand Paul and sounded like the old man down the street screaming to the new kids on the block, “Get off my lawn!”
 The real reason McCain and Lindsey Graham embarrassed themselves on the floor of Senate had nothing to do with what Rand Paul said. Rand Paul&amp;rsquo;s ideas terrify McCain, Graham, and most of the Republican establishment.</description>

      <description>John McCain doesn&amp;rsquo;t want the Republican Party to outlive him.
He&amp;rsquo;s afraid. Afraid that, after he&amp;rsquo;s gone, his political widow will remarry someone younger, sexier, more fun.
Thursday, March 7, 2013: Senate Office Building, Washington, DC In the dark cloisters of his Senate office, McCain leans back in his chair, tie loosened, jacket tossed casually over a guest chair, fingers interlaced behind his white head, and broods.
He sees those rascally young libertarians&amp;ndash;the ones who actually want to own their own lives&amp;ndash;plunging into the party.</description>

      <title>Ron Paul&#39;s Fifteen Minutes</title>

      <description>Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) generates more internet press than all the other candidates combined, it seems. His name has been on Technorati&amp;rsquo;s most-searched list for a couple weeks, rivaling Paris Hilton and YouTube for search popularity endurance. Whether or not his fledgling campaign for President will so endure is another matter.
Rummaging through the odd blog with a Ron Paul theme, I found some common characteristics among his supporters:
 * Young * Typically apolitical * Technology careers * Homosexual * Educated * Atheist * Decent writing skills * No particular axe to grind  I know many who fit the type, particularly working in the software industry.</description>
