      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re getting close, folks. So close you can feel it. Close your eyes and feel the soft, warm breath on the back of your neck. (Now open your eyes and continue reading. You&amp;rsquo;re such a good reader.)
As you watch the polls shift rapidly toward Trump, you might wonder what&amp;rsquo;s happening. What&amp;rsquo;s happening is completely natural, but it&amp;rsquo;s not normal. Elections don&amp;rsquo;t usually go this way. And two psychological phenomena are working to deliver the Trump landslide I predicted long ago.</description>

      <description>Politico announced Tuesday: Clinton&amp;rsquo;s Advisors Tell Her to Prep for a Landslide
Inquisitor said the same day: Hillary Clinton Campaign Preparing for a Landslide
The stories beneath those headlines spoke of the intense hubris inside the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign. Their &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo; declared the race over on Tuesday. Assured of a landslide, Clinton stopped campaigning and turned to what the Clinton&amp;rsquo;s do best: extorting money from the ultra-rich.</description>

      <description>You probably remember that in September 1980 voters couldn’t wait to cast a vote for Reagan.
If you remember it like that, you remember wrong. At least a little wrong.
TIME magazine examined voter sentiment in its September 15, 1980, issue. Voters that year sounded a lot like voters this year. Here’s how TIME’s Ed Magnuson summarized the voters of 1980:
 Disenchanted, but not apathetic. Caring about issues, although much more concerned about character.</description>

      <description>I have no idea who will win the Indiana primary 72 hours from the time I write. But the people inside Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s campaign seem to have an idea. And it&amp;rsquo;s not good for them. Cruz&amp;rsquo;s top team expects their candidate to lose. And Senator Cruz seems to have accepted that outcome.
Expectations Matter More Than Preferences Regular readers know that polls that ask &amp;ldquo;who do you think will win&amp;rdquo; trump polls that ask &amp;ldquo;who do you intend to vote for&amp;rdquo; or even &amp;ldquo;who did you vote for?</description>

      <description>Nate Silver publishes a daily number that represents Barack Obama’s chances of being re-elected. As I write this on October 27, Silver’s magic number is 74%.
