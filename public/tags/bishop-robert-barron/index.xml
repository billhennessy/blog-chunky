      <description>Tina Turner not withstanding, love is not an emotion, and that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing.
In today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel (from the modern lectionary), Jesus tells his disciples to &amp;ldquo;love your enemies&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;pray for those who persecute you.&amp;rdquo;
But how? I find it difficult even to be around certain people, much less love them. Surely, Jesus wasn&amp;rsquo;t serious when He told us to love our enemies, right? If Jesus meant what He said, then I must not know what love means.</description>
