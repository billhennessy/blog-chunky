      <description>I made a lot of money on the election. Most of that money I cashed out. But I left a small balance in case I saw another opportunity to bet against the prevailing wisdom.
I saw that opportunityt last night.
My PredictIt Success In January 2016, I bought three kinds of shares on PredictIt, the prediction market.
*1. Trump would win the Republican nomination. *2. Trump would win the White House.</description>

      <description>Scott Adams pointed out the linguistic brilliance of Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s perfect summation of James Comey&amp;rsquo;s failed takedown attempt.
&amp;ldquo;No obstruction. No collusion. He&amp;rsquo;s a leaker.&amp;rdquo;
That&amp;rsquo;s how Trump summarized Comey&amp;rsquo;s testimony to the Senate&amp;rsquo;s Russian Conspiracy Hoax Committee.
Click to watch:
  
Scott is a genius in persuasion and psychology. Everything he just said about Trump&amp;rsquo;s linguistic kill-shot is dead-on accurate. Trump destroyed Comey without firing a shot. &amp;ldquo;No obstruction.</description>

      <description>You might be stressing out when you learn that James Comey sent another letter to Congress. In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t hear, he did. And he said that the emails found on Huma Abedin&amp;rsquo;s computer did not change his earlier conclusion about Hillary Clinton.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to panic or get mad or dejected. Totally understandable. But that&amp;rsquo;s totally counterproductive, too. And being mad or acting dispirited is just what the elites want us to do.</description>

      <title>Convict Hillary</title>

      <description>A lot of people are mad at FBI Director James Comey. Comey read a list of crimes committed by Hillary Clinton, then announced he couldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend prosecution for those crimes. On its face, it sounds like Comey caved.
Let&amp;rsquo;s play the imagine game. Imagine Comey decided to refer Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s crimes to the Department of Justice for prosecution. What would happen?
First, you&amp;rsquo;d never hear about it. The FBI and the DOJ don&amp;rsquo;t discuss active criminal investigations.</description>
