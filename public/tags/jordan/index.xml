      <description>Pro-Western governments in these countries have fallen to anti-American forces or diminished their support for the US since Barack Obama became president.
* Lebanon** Jordan** Yemen** Qatar** Egypt** Turkey  Obama’s campaign promise to restore respect for America around the world is a joke. A cruel and dangerous joke. Our enemies see Obama’s weakness as American weakness. As they did during Jimmy Carter’s failed presidency, those enemies are advancing.
The next president will have more than a financial catastrophe to fix.</description>

      <title>Forcing Functions</title>

      <description>An old boss of mine liked “forcing functions.” Forced us to meet delivery dates, while arbitrary dates tended to cause a “so what” attitude toward deadlines. Forcing functions like trade shows, magazine reviews, and client launches forced development teams to ship, no matter what.
Keep that in mind for a moment while we look at the Obama Administration.
Barack Obama campaigned on a promise to clip America’s wings. I know he didn’t use that term, but it was clear what he meant when he visited the Mediterranean and Germany.</description>
