Dellena Jones&amp;rsquo;s business was already struggling. She didn&amp;rsquo;t need this.
Let&amp;rsquo;s prove that we believe in free enterprise entrepreneurship. That we can help our neighbors.
You can donate to help Dellena on this GoFundMe project

      <description>The daily news about Joplin has faded.
  
The turmoil remains.
The list of desperately needed items is shorter, but the need is more acute than ever.
Please help.
If you can, please bring NEW items for Joplin to Sky Music Lounge Thursday, November 17, between 7 and 10 pm. Please bring ONLY items on this list. Rob Brenner will make sure they get where they&amp;rsquo;re desperately needed.</description>
