      <description>Warren Buffett makes the erroneous claim that he pays less in taxes than does his secretary. He claims that the government thus “coddles” the rich. He asks the government to increase his taxes, and the taxes of others like him, as if he is incapable of doing that on his own.
Buffett is half right. He proves that government coddles people by** asking the government to solve his problem of guilt**.</description>
