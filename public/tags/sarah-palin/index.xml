      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know why, then you&amp;rsquo;re reading the wrong blog.
The New Agenda is keeping tabs on sponsors of David Letterman&amp;rsquo;s show. I have already told T-Mobile that I will cancel may $120 month service (paying the penalty) if they don&amp;rsquo;t stop advertising on The Late Show by July 15.
Top names on the boycott list:
 * Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson * T-Mobile * Ford * Nissan/Infiniti * Toyota/Lexus * Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble * Citigroup (which should be out of business, anyway) * Chase (JPMC) * The Gap (plus Old Navy and Banana Republic) * Wyeth * Saturn * Hotels.</description>

      <description>Sarah Palin will push 9 toss-up states into McCain&amp;rsquo;s camp (from left to right):
 * Nevada * Colorado * New Mexico * [Michigan](https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13198.html) * New Hampshire * Indiana * Ohio * Virginia * [Florida](https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReportEmail.aspx?g=e3a24829-6f3f-4928-b30f-cb21804091f0)  This will give McCain the Electoral College victory in November, 300 to 238. The Palin-Effect works two different ways: Rough Rider Admiration and Strong Woman Identification. This estimate and projection is based on analysis of detailed polling data from Gallup and Reuters.</description>

      <title>How True</title>

      <description>Jay Nordlinger writes on NRO:
   And, believe it or not, this advice might be worth something: I caution liberals, both in politics and in the media (same diff, right?), not to let Palin drive them nuts. A lot of conservatives — a lot of us conservatives, I might say — were driven nuts by Clinton. We were driven nuts by his enduring popularity in the face of tremendous misdeeds.</description>

      <title>Palin Power **Updates Galore**</title>

      <description>Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s Vice Presidential acceptance speech was a grand slam, walk-off homerun to the opposite field that knocked a beer out of Obama&amp;rsquo;s hand after the concession stand closed.
She was smooth, easy, natural, funny, smart, real, genuine, organic, and brilliant.
My favorite line: &amp;quot; . . . after the fake, styrofoam Greek columns have been hauled back to the lot in Hollywood . . .&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Live blog of the most anticipated convention speech in our lifetimes.
https://www.coveritlive.com/index2.php/option=com_altcaster/task=viewaltcast/altcast_code=5af59d4052/height=550/width=470
Anderson Cooper, CNN: &amp;ldquo;The excitement here is palpable.&amp;rdquo; Shep Smith, Fox: &amp;ldquo;I have never been so excited about speech in my life. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait.&amp;rdquo; Chris Wallace, Fox: &amp;ldquo;Oh, this is big, I&amp;rsquo;m excited, and that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen at conventions very often.&amp;rdquo;
I feel like I did at 4:30 p.m. on Super Bowl Sunday in 2000: one hour before the Rammies kicked off against the Titans.</description>
