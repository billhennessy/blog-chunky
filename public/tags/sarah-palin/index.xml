      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know why, then you&amp;rsquo;re reading the wrong blog.
The New Agenda is keeping tabs on sponsors of David Letterman&amp;rsquo;s show. I have already told T-Mobile that I will cancel may $120 month service (paying the penalty) if they don&amp;rsquo;t stop advertising on The Late Show by July 15.
Top names on the boycott list:
 * Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson * T-Mobile * Ford * Nissan/Infiniti * Toyota/Lexus * Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble * Citigroup (which should be out of business, anyway) * Chase (JPMC) * The Gap (plus Old Navy and Banana Republic) * Wyeth * Saturn * Hotels.</description>

      <description>Sarah Palin will push 9 toss-up states into McCain&amp;rsquo;s camp (from left to right):
 * Nevada * Colorado * New Mexico * [Michigan](https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13198.html) * New Hampshire * Indiana * Ohio * Virginia * [Florida](https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReportEmail.aspx?g=e3a24829-6f3f-4928-b30f-cb21804091f0)  This will give McCain the Electoral College victory in November, 300 to 238. The Palin-Effect works two different ways: Rough Rider Admiration and Strong Woman Identification. This estimate and projection is based on analysis of detailed polling data from Gallup and Reuters.</description>

      <title>How True</title>

      <description>Jay Nordlinger writes on NRO:
   And, believe it or not, this advice might be worth something: I caution liberals, both in politics and in the media (same diff, right?), not to let Palin drive them nuts. A lot of conservatives — a lot of us conservatives, I might say — were driven nuts by Clinton. We were driven nuts by his enduring popularity in the face of tremendous misdeeds.</description>

      <title>Palin Power **Updates Galore**</title>

      <description>Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s Vice Presidential acceptance speech was a grand slam, walk-off homerun to the opposite field that knocked a beer out of Obama&amp;rsquo;s hand after the concession stand closed.
She was smooth, easy, natural, funny, smart, real, genuine, organic, and brilliant.
My favorite line: &amp;quot; . . . after the fake, styrofoam Greek columns have been hauled back to the lot in Hollywood . . .&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Live blog of the most anticipated convention speech in our lifetimes.

Anderson Cooper, CNN: &amp;ldquo;The excitement here is palpable.&amp;rdquo; Shep Smith, Fox: &amp;ldquo;I have never been so excited about speech in my life. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait.&amp;rdquo; Chris Wallace, Fox: &amp;ldquo;Oh, this is big, I&amp;rsquo;m excited, and that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen at conventions very often.&amp;rdquo;
I feel like I did at 4:30 p.m. on Super Bowl Sunday in 2000: one hour before the Rammies kicked off against the Titans.</description>

      <title>If I Wrote Sarah Palin&#39;s Speech</title>

      <description>Excerpt:
. . .
 They say I lack experience. They&amp;rsquo;re right, in a way.
 I have no experience wandering a city for three years trying to find myself. No, I&amp;rsquo;ve never had that luxury. But Barack Obama has.
And I have no experience funneling money from an educational trust into organizations run by my close friend, the convicted terrorist. No experience at all.
Nor do I have the experience of having a political career launched by a pair of terrorists who tried to blow up the Capitol and the Pentagon, who succeeded in killing a police officer.</description>

Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s eldest daughter, Bristol, is pregnant and will marry Levi, the child&amp;rsquo;s father, Todd and Sarah said today in a press release [FoxNews.com].
 The 17-year-old unwed daughter of John McCain’s new running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, is five-months pregnant, Palin and her husband, Todd Palin, said Monday in a written statement.
 McCain’s campaign told FOX News that the presumptive Republican presidential candidate knew about Bristol Palin’s pregnancy before he chose Palin as his running mate last Friday, and that Bristol is planning to marry the father of her child.</description>

      <title>Palin The Star At Missouri McCain Rally</title>

      <description>Every mention of Sarah Palin produced a banner-waving roar from the crowd of over 20,000 in T. R. Hughes Stadium in O&amp;rsquo;Fallon, Missouri, on blistering hot Sunday afternoon. While McCain is on top of the ticket, Palin is the draw.
A woman from Dent County&amp;ndash;about 3 hours from O&amp;rsquo;Fallon&amp;ndash;made the drive to see McCain and Palin in person. She was thrilled to get hold of a &amp;ldquo;McCain-Palin&amp;rdquo; banner after several stacks of the banners didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to her.</description>

      <title>McCain - Palin Rally in O&#39;Fallon, Missouri, Is Still On</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re getting ready to head out to the McCain Rally in O&amp;rsquo;Fallon, Missouri. I just checked with the campaign and the rally is still on. John McCain is stopping in New Orleans to check on hurricane preparations before the rally, so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if it starts late.
I&amp;rsquo;ll have photos and a report on the events this evening.

      <description>Conservative spirits soared like roman candles three times in my life:
 * Ronald Reagan&#39;s emergence in 1980 * Newt Gingrich&#39;s Contract with America in 1994 * [Sarah Palin&#39;s selection](https://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0808/GOP_grassroots_on_fire.html) as McCain&#39;s vice president in 2008  Besides the math (each event exactly 14 years apart), Palin&amp;rsquo;s selection could change the face of politics in America for a long time.
Yesterday, I hurriedly outlined some of the instant wins from McCain&amp;rsquo;s brilliant move.</description>
