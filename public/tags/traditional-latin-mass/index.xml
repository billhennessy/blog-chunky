      <description>Monsignor Eugene Morris livestreamed his private Mass for the fourth Sunday in Lent today. The Mass is preceded by the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
Monsignor&amp;rsquo;s wonderful homily is worth sharing with everyone you know.
I apologize that I did not see this earlier.
  You will see why I fell in love with the Oratory of Ss. Gregory and Augustine. You can Like their Facebook page to keep track of future livestreamed Masses here.</description>

      <description>Call me &amp;ldquo;rigid.&amp;rdquo;
Last night, I saw a tweet that broke my heart.
A woman wrote that her husband told her he was going to Mass after work. But he went to a bar, instead. She went to the bar. He was there. He was drunk.
She asked for our prayers.
I said one for her, and two for her husband.
The woman is a traditional Catholic, like me. Or what the Holy Father calls &amp;ldquo;rigid.</description>
