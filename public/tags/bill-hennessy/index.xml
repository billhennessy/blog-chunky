      <description>Hi. Bill Hennessy here. If you can, please stop by 111 Clarkson Executive Park, Ellisville, MO 63011 on Tuesday, September 2 at 7 p.m. (RSVP Here if you&amp;rsquo;d like.)
I have something I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk to you about. It&amp;rsquo;s about the tea party movement. But it&amp;rsquo;s really about understanding two very important concepts:
*1. Living to our purpose. *2. Doing what&amp;rsquo;s important.
This is not a training session. It&amp;rsquo;s not an After Party.</description>

      <description>My new ebook, Zen Conservatism, will be available for download ($9.50) within the week. To prepare, I’ve posted the first chapter which you can download for free.
Here’s more about the book:
You consider yourself a patriot and a proud American.
You have become more and more concerned about the direction your country is headed.
You wish you could just yell “STOP!” –and someone would listen.
“Zen Conservatism,” was written for you.</description>
