      <description>I dwell on this too much, but my new ebook&amp;ndash;Zen Conservatism&amp;ndash;is now available. Currently, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay byGoogle Checkout.
The hard launch is scheduled for Monday, December 14, but I wanted to make the ebook available to St. Louis Tea Partiers early AND at a discount of only $6.50. (It will go up to $9.50 on Monday.)
In addition to the Zen Conservatism ebook, you can register now to become Happier, Healthier, and More Effective in just 3 Minutes a Day.</description>

      <description>My new ebook, Zen Conservatism, will be available for download ($9.50) within the week. To prepare, I’ve posted the first chapter which you can download for free.
Here’s more about the book:
You consider yourself a patriot and a proud American.
You have become more and more concerned about the direction your country is headed.
You wish you could just yell “STOP!” –and someone would listen.
“Zen Conservatism,” was written for you.</description>
