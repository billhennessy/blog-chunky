      <description>Friends,
Let me begin by saying &amp;ldquo;I am sorry&amp;rdquo; to Robert Mueller and his family.
I have been critical of Mr. Mueller and his sham &amp;ldquo;investigation.&amp;rdquo; I have been uncharitable to him. And I am sorry.
It became clear today that Mr. Mueller wasn&amp;rsquo;t a hostile actor. Obviously, Mueller is seriously impaired. What we saw in his selection of lawyers, in his handling of the investigation, in his management of partisan and criminal conduct by senior Justice Department officials under his command resulted not from malice toward the president but from incompetence.</description>
