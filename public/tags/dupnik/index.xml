      <description>I am so proud to be bringing the Spirit of St. Louis to the great people of Tucson, Arizona, this weekend.
Dana Loesch and Jim Hoft are among the speakers at Tucson’s Tea Party on April 30.
The Tea Party is on Saturday, April 30 at 9 am Pacific (11 am Central). And there’s much, much more than just the Tea Party going on. Check it all out here. If you have friends in the area, please ask them to come out.</description>

      <description>The incompetent Sheriff Dupnik of Pima County Arizona has intimidated speakers in an attempt to shut down the Tucson Tea Party.
Now, Tucson’s asking for our help. Jennifer Humphries wrote to Gateway Pundit Jim Hoft. She asked Jim of his help defending the First Amendment rights of the people of Tucson. Those rights are under assault from an incompetent and irresponsible sheriff who has now turned to intimidation to silence dissent.</description>
