      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard the news that Donald Trump believes it&amp;rsquo;s possible for a Muslim judge to treat him unfairly. Do you think Trump is wrong about this?
When asked by a reporter if Trump believed it would be possible for a Muslim judge to treat him unfairly, Trump answered, &amp;ldquo;It’s possible, yes. Yeah. That would be possible, absolutely.&amp;rdquo;
Notice that Trump didn&amp;rsquo;t say, &amp;ldquo;all Muslim judges are unfair to me.&amp;rdquo; Nor did he say all Hispanic judges are unfair.</description>
