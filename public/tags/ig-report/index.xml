      <description>IG Report: Obama Out-Dicked Nixon
Nixon resigned. He resigned after a half-dozen Republican Senators told him, in the Oval Office, that a majority of Senators would vote to remove him from office if the House impeached him.
So Nixon resigned.
Nixon&amp;rsquo;s crimes were limited to covering up a break-in and wiretapping by employees of his re-election committee.
Baraka Obama did worse. And he got by.
Obama out-dicked Nixon.
The IG Report Department of Justice Inspector-General Michael Horowitz released his report on Monday.</description>
