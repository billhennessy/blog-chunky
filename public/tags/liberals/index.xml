      <title>Liberals Are Not the Enemy</title>

      <description>Forgive me. I say &amp;ldquo;liberal&amp;rdquo; sometimes when I mean something else.
My mistake is habit, not irony. (Irony would require some intent on my part.)
I grew up disparaging liberalism. I grew up reading and watching William F. Buckley Jr., for whom liberalism was the enemy.
In the post-WWII era, the liberalism of the day was a problem. But it was never the problem.
The problem in Western Civilization was a faction that used liberalism as cover.</description>

      <title>Am I an Idiot?</title>

      <description>For most of my life I was naïve. I think.
I thought that most people who voted for larger government, higher taxes, tighter regulation, and limits on speech, religion, and assembly, were misguided.
I’ve always known and acknowledged that the people who advocated and plotted to concentrate power in the hands of a few were wicked creatures. I never hesitated to attack them head-on.
But the others. The others I sometimes pitied.</description>

      <title>Brookings Institute Says US Gaining in Iraq</title>

      <description>The headline would have read, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re Gaining in Iraq,&amp;rdquo; but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to confuse any liberals for whom the &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; in Iraq is al Qaeda.
The surge is working according two liberals from the Brookings Institute writing in the New York Times. And according to Dean Barnett blogging on HughHewitt.townhall.com, their former friends on the left are ready to do to them what it appears Chuck Schumer did to the Chief Justice.</description>

      <title>MichelleMalkin.com Called &#34;Hate Site&#34;</title>

      <description>Michelle Malkin responds to that unnecessary race of humans known as liberals. The liberals, it seems, have gone about calling her web site, michellemalkin.com, a &amp;ldquo;hate-site.&amp;rdquo;
Other bloggers are jumping in to defend Michelle. I won&amp;rsquo;t. I think she has one of the best blogs in the business, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t need my defense.
First, liberals are evil little creatures&amp;ndash;more little than evil, in the small, petty sense. Their self-righteous slander is not really meant to hurt its target as to aggrandize the speaker or writer in his own small mind and among his own petty peers.</description>
