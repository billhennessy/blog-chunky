      <description>The new fad among Democrats is to see how many illegal aliens they can pack into a voting booth. While we conservatives decry this illegal and anti-American grab at tyrannical power, we should take some solace in this sobering fact: those illegal aliens probably know as much about the American political system as most 13th generation Americans.
  
The fact is, most Americans are too stupid about politics to vote, which explains the 2008 election.</description>

      <description>A Washington Post/ABC News poll shows a major shift in sentiment toward (against?) the tea party movement.
I would not challenge the accuracy of the results which show the tea party’s popularity waning among Southerners and people 18 to 29. In fact, the poll shows that a full 50 percent of Americans now have a negative view of the tea party.
Sure, there may have been some chicanery with the questions to skew the results.</description>
