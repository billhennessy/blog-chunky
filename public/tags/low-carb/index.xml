      <description>It took the nanny-staters to more than a minute to scream at low-carb dieters like me about the Mediterranean Diet study released today.
The study shows that Atkins-like, low-carbohydrate diets are the most effective kind for both weight loss and good health. That joys me, because the only way I can lose and keep of weight is with low carbs. Even when I was running half marathons, I was well over 200 lbs on a 6-1 frame.</description>
