      <description>The Obama administration has no intention of relinquishing dictatorial control of the banks according to financial expert Stuart Varney.  The government wants to control the banks, just as it now controls GM and Chrysler, and will surely control the health industry in the not-too-distant future. Keeping them TARP-stuffed is the key to control. And for this intensely political president, mere influence is not enough. The White House wants to tell &amp;lsquo;em what to do.</description>
