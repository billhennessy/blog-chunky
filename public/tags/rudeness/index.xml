      <description>An ice cream parlor in Massachusetts closed one day after re-opening because customers treated his employees like dirt.
Owner Mark Lawrence told Fox25 Boston, via Fox News:
 “People have forgotten how to treat other human beings in the six or seven weeks that they’ve been confined to their homes,” he told the station. “They have no clue how to respect other human beings.”
 After just one day, Lawrence closed his shop.</description>
