      <description>You will be mad.
You probably don&amp;rsquo;t have a contract with Equifax. Your creditors do.
When you apply for a loan, you give creditors permission to:
*1. Obtain your credit file. *2. Update your credit file.
You expect that creditors vet their vendors, don&amp;rsquo;t you? You assume banks and credit card companies test their vendors&amp;rsquo; security.
And you expect financial services companies like Equifax to be on the up and up.</description>
