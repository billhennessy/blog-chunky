      <description>Worry about your character, not your reputation. Reputation is what people think of you. Character is who you are.
 —John Wooden, legendary coach of basketball and character
Everyone admits that President Trump cares more about his character than about his reputation. Only a man concerned with his character would tell the truth.
Reputation is what people think of you. Character is who you are.
The Stoics teach us that reputation is beyond our control.</description>
