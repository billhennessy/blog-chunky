      <description>For the past four years. conservatives have worried more about being right while liberals worried about winning.
We all know how that worked out.
It doesn’t matter how right you are if you’re powerless.Right now we are.
Satisfied?
I didn’t think so.

After four years of 5,000 Leap and Constitution study groups, of Constitutional workshops, and rallies in the park, let’s make a vow to ourselves and to each other: We’re Done With Losing.</description>

      <description>If you need to blame someone for our election losses, blame me.

I Let You Down I could have done more. I could have spoken up sooner. I could have been more honest with you about the mistakes we made and the opportunities we ignored. I could have worked harder on what I saw as the most important work we could do.
I let you down. I focused on petty issues of the day, too, instead of working on a different future.</description>
