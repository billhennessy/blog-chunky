      <description>I did not watch America&amp;rsquo;s Toxic Asset on 60 Minutes for the same reason I&amp;rsquo;ve never read &amp;ldquo;Mein Kampf.&amp;rdquo; Some people&amp;rsquo;s words do not deserve my ear.
I find it interesting, though, that Mr. Obama&amp;rsquo;s 90 minute interview on a program called &amp;ldquo;60 Minutes&amp;rdquo; so eerily parallels his budget: he consumed 150 percent of what was available.
To those who watched our dictator-in-the-making, I ask a question, the answer to which should demonstrate that watching the propaganda piece was useles: what did you learn that you didn&amp;rsquo;t know before?</description>
