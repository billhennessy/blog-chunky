Our panel discusses the conservative case for marijuana law reform.
I am honored by the invitation, and I’d love to see a big turnout of tea partiers for the event.

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;d think people would listen when a career police officer says we need to reform marijuana laws. But n-o-o-o-o. Not in St. Louis, anyway.
Gary Wiegert is a 30+ year police officer who signed up to lobby Jefferson City on behalf of tea party issues a couple of years ago. Some people freaked out over that, but Gary was instrumental in advancing tea party issues for the past 2 years.</description>

      <description>**If Republicans want to put their liberty where their mouths are, they can begin by ending the war on weed. **
When I was a kid in South St. Louis in the 70s, marijuana was the weed in the field that separated traditional post-war American values from the hippies. It was an easy black-and-white issue: smoke dope, you’re un-American. It was the Boomers against the Greatest Generation, and no one questioned the pure evil of pot.</description>
