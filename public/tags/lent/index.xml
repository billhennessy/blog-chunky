      <description>My heart and soul needed a good spring cleaning, and Lent arrived just in time.
Lent is fasting season. Most people know what fasting is, but many people don&amp;rsquo;t know what religious fasting is for. What good does fasting do the soul?
Fasting is form of asceticism. That means intentionally depriving yourself of some comfort or sensual pleasure. Asceticism does not require pain or self-flagellation. Self-flagellation tends to lead to pride and should be avoided.</description>

      <description>I have never looked forward to the start of Lent.
Lent is a time of repentance and atonement in anticipation of the commemoration of the passion, death, and resurrection of Christ Jesus. The whole idea of repentance and atonement always bothered me.
Until now.
This year, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for Lent to begin.
First, I&amp;rsquo;ve been called to redirect my zeal away from politics and toward God. Instead of bringing people into communion with the Constitution and liberty, I&amp;rsquo;m asked to bring people to Christ and Christ to people.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What did you give up for Lent?&amp;rdquo;
Ever get that one? Like it&amp;rsquo;s something you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to post on your Facebook page.
A very good priest I knew, Dom Oppenheimer, warned against revealing one&amp;rsquo;s Lenten sacrifice.
&amp;ldquo;When you tell others what you gave up for Lent, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to feel some pride,&amp;rdquo; he explained. &amp;ldquo;But pride is the worst sin.&amp;rdquo;
That actually makes a lot of sense when you think about.</description>

      <title>Unto Dust We Shall Return</title>

      <description>Today begins Lent.

Lent prepares us for the cycle of mortality and resurrection, perfected by Christ, without which life has no meaning. It’s a time of humility. We call to mind our human brokenness in hopes of making ourselves better imitators of Christ.
On Ash Wednesday, we mark ourselves with the sign of the cross in ashes. **“Remember, man, that you are dust and unto dust you shall return (Genesis 3:19).</description>
