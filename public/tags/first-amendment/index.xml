      <description>Every inch of US territory is a Constitutionally guaranteed free-speech zone. I am all for arresting and prosecuting without mercy any government employee&amp;ndash;including military&amp;ndash;who attempt to limit the size or scope of this zone.

During the Bundy Ranch standoff in Nevada, the Bureau of Land Management set up &amp;ldquo;free-speech zones.&amp;rdquo; I prefer to call them &amp;ldquo;First Amendment pens.&amp;rdquo;
The government uses these pens to segregate people. The US government says, &amp;ldquo;If you want to speak your mind, you may do so only within the pen.</description>

      <description>Events of the past week show the power of the Second Amendment to challenge government tyranny, regardless of the government’s firepower advantage. Let me back up, though.
A Smart Man’s Stupid Argument for Gun Control A year ago, the gun control lobby pumped a Facebook post by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, one of my favorite thinkers.
In his post, Taleb argued that the Second Amendment means nothing because the federal government has massively superior firepower:</description>

      <description>Colleges in the United States are systematically destroying free speech, free thought, and creative writing. Sixty-five percent of colleges and universities censor students, even in creative writing classes.

      <description>When Barack Obama declared that Catholics must either violate their consciences or face government persecution, he wasn’t going after just Catholics. Nor was he promoting healthcare.
Barack Obama and his myrmidon Kathleen Sebelius tried to erase the First Amendment. They tried to erase religious freedom. They tried to take away yet another foundational liberty that made America America.
And they will try again  &#34;
Unless you stop them.
But how are you going to stop them alone?</description>

      <description>Sometimes I’m ashamed and embarrassed at my roots. See, I graduated from the same Catholic grade school as St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, I know. But how else do I react to stories like this one from George Will.
  It seems that Mayor Slay’s administration is busy trampling all over the rights of a citizen, Jim Roos.
Roos painted a sign on a building he owns that days “End Eminent Domain Abuse.</description>
