      <description>Unbelievable! Scientists have discovered that the huge, glowing fireball in the sky may affect Earth’s temperature.
The latest evidence comes from . . . the Moon.
Back when we used to send astronauts to the Moon, we placed some temperature sensors on the Moon’s surface. We still monitor those sensors.
Guess what they show. Yep, you’re right! As temperatures rose on Earth, temperatures rose on the Moon.

Watts Up With That has all the details.</description>

      <description>NASA was wrong!
Michelle Malkin does an outstanding job of breaking down the NASA Y2K error that sort of invented global warming.
In short, 1998 was NOT the hottest year of the 20th century. And half of the hottest years on record occured before WWII. Al Gore is an idiot, and now NASA scientists have proven it.
Earlier this week, the wackos got bad news from U of C San Diego and NASA who discovered that aerosols do not mask atmospheric warming but accelerate it.</description>

      <title>Where&#39;s All The Hurricanes?</title>

      <description>Al Gore said this would be the worst year for hurricanes since hurricaning began, in 1952.
Matt Margolis, who does great research, has the answer.
 The 2007 hurricane season may be less severe than forecast due to cooler-than-expected water temperatures in the tropical Atlantic, private forecaster WSI Corp said on Tuesday.
 Just not enough global warming. The Gores&amp;rsquo;ll have to kick out a lot more CO2 in 2008. See Matt&amp;rsquo;s piece for the whole story.</description>
