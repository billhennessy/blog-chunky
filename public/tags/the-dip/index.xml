      <description>I received a couple of phone calls this morning. Maybe because of the primary election in Missouri. Or is the stifling, stale heat of August that drove the calls? Either way, I believe the calls represent very good news.
We survived The Dip (Godin, 2007).

Back in April, I sensed a dip in the burgeoning grassroots movement. By June 1, my suspicions were confirmed and I blogged about The Dip.</description>

      <description>Seth Godin is one of my favorite writers, thinkers, marketers, and presenters. Everything he writes is worth your time reading. Two of his books stand out for me. One is Tribes, because Tribes describes the whole Tea Party experience perfectly. And he wrote it a year before the Tea Party things started.
Right now, though, my other favorite Godin book serves as a question and a guide for the Tea Party movement.</description>
