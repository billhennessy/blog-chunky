      <description>Lying is tough business.
People believe lies with more details. Time, date, people, exact words, what people were wearing, sequences of events. All that. So liars usually provide some gripping details to make their lies more believable.
In casual conversation, this works. Once some sucker buys your lie, you&amp;rsquo;re pretty much in the clear. The problem comes when you broadcast your lie for maximum coverage. The more people who hear the lie, the more people try to verify those details.</description>
