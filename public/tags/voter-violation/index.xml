      <description>This &amp;ldquo;VOTING VIOLATION&amp;rdquo; controversy says bad things about the Cruz campaign.
(BTW, Rubio&amp;rsquo;s campaign sent a similar, but less creepy, mailer, too. So far, I have not seen a large number of complaints about the Rubio mailer.)
And I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the ethics of publicly shaming people who vote sporadically. I&amp;rsquo;m talking two gross electioneering violations from a campaign that markets itself as the most scientifically advanced in history. With the mailer Team Cruz showed a lack of strategic understanding of the science and compounded their ignorance by apparently making up numbers.</description>
