      <description>Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) generates more internet press than all the other candidates combined, it seems. His name has been on Technorati&amp;rsquo;s most-searched list for a couple weeks, rivaling Paris Hilton and YouTube for search popularity endurance. Whether or not his fledgling campaign for President will so endure is another matter.
Rummaging through the odd blog with a Ron Paul theme, I found some common characteristics among his supporters:
 * Young * Typically apolitical * Technology careers * Homosexual * Educated * Atheist * Decent writing skills * No particular axe to grind  I know many who fit the type, particularly working in the software industry.</description>
