      <description>When people asked me to get behind Rick Stream, I first wanted to make sure that was the right thing. I remembered that I have a friend who helped Rick a while ago. So I asked her.
Rick Stream is &amp;ldquo;a quiet leader.&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t see him as a politician,&amp;rdquo; she told me. We were talking about Rick Stream, the candidate for St. Louis County Executive.

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t you just love brash upstarts? People with verve and moxie?
I do. I like pesky guys full of gumption, like Vladimir Sobotka. I like energetic young political activists like Kenny Newhouse. And I like bold conservative organizers like Eileen Tyrrell. In fact, nothing pleases me more than seeing young, libertarian-ish Republicans making the establishment squirm.
Sometimes the squirming establishment is as small as a GOP township or a school district.</description>
