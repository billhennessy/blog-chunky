      <description>Imagine yourself in a foreign country with a fake passport, a fake name, a fake cover story, and mission to make it home with stolen, top secret documents from that country&amp;rsquo;s government.

That&amp;rsquo;s how John Braddock begins his third book, A Spy&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Taking Risks. With the story of his first mission as an alias.
In his previous books, A Spy&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Thinking and A Spy&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Strategy, Braddock, a retired CIA Field Officer, provided readers with top-notch spy stories and top-shelf tools for success.</description>

      <description>Looks like about $1.2 billion of JP Morgan’s $2 billion loss involved Henry Blodget’s 401k. 
How else to explain his emotional outburst on Business Insider? Why else would he jump to the conclusion that our bankrupt federal government understands finances better than billionaires?
Here’s Blodget:
 Wall Street can&amp;rsquo;t be trusted to manage—or even correctly assess—its own risks.
This is in part because, time and again, Wall Street has demonstrated that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even KNOW what risks it is taking.</description>
