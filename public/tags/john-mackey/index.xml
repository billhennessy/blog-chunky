      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re going to hit me with the small sample size argument here, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay.
I firmly believe that the purpose of a company is to make life better, and if it does that well, it will make a profit. If, on the other hand, a company makes life worse, the market should let that company die.
Some companies try to improve life with insanely great technology products. Some make life better with fast, safe cars that are fun to drive.</description>

      <description>The motivating force behind the first tea party protests of February 27, 2009, was , in part, crony capitalism. Across the country and on the steps of the Arch in St. Louis, signs and speakers denounced bailouts for failed businesses.
Rasmussen found that 68 percent of Americans believe Big Business and Big Government work together against the rest of us.
I think they’re right.
Since then, crony capitalism has only grown.</description>

      <description>I am a big fan of Milton Friedman. I’m also becoming a big fan of Creating Shared Value. Some believe the two values are inconsistent, but I disagree.
In 2005, Reason Magazine posted an online debate between Friedman and Whole Foods Market CEO John Mackey. The debate coincided with the 35th anniversary of Friedmans’ famous The New York Times Magazine article entitled: : &amp;ldquo;The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits.</description>

      <description>The most disappointing thing about leaving the military is that it usually means leaving the last bastion of leadership in America. If you open your own business or freelance, you probably don’t notice the cowardly bastards populating corner offices in most American enterprises. You’d puke, as Holden Caulfield might say.
John Mackey of Whole Foods had the courage to oppose socialized medicine AND to defend his position and his right to say it.</description>
