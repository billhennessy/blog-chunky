      <description>I usually breeze through books.
I read Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman in four days. And it has math.
I read Eric Greitens&amp;rsquo;s book The Heart and the Fist in two days.
Why did it take me over a month to finish Resilience?
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure, but here&amp;rsquo;s what I think.
First, the book compels action. How could I read this paragraph without writing a blog post?
  If we are trapped in a life where everything is provided for us, our minds fail to grow, our relationships atrophy, and our spirits deteriorate.</description>

      <description>A critic is someone who enters the battlefield after the war is over and shoots the wounded.
 ― Murray Kempton
Great leaders inspire thought and action.
But their real value? Great leaders inspire action. Hard action. Uncomfortable action.
I&amp;rsquo;m reading Resilience by Eric Greitens. I have already bought six copies of the book, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll buy more. I want everyone to read it. The book changes people.</description>
