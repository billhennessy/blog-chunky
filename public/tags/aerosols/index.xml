      <description>NASA was wrong!
Michelle Malkin does an outstanding job of breaking down the NASA Y2K error that sort of invented global warming.
In short, 1998 was NOT the hottest year of the 20th century. And half of the hottest years on record occured before WWII. Al Gore is an idiot, and now NASA scientists have proven it.
Earlier this week, the wackos got bad news from U of C San Diego and NASA who discovered that aerosols do not mask atmospheric warming but accelerate it.</description>
