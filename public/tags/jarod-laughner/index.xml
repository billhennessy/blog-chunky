      <description>The most often repeated story is not the reluctant hero or the hero who wants to get home. Nor is it about a mother’s love.
The ultimate archetypical story line is:
LIBERAL PRESS ERRONEOUSLY BLAMES TEA PARTY FOR LEFTIST CRIMES
As Jarod Lee Loughner’s political bent emerges, we see the same, predictable story playing out:
1. A horrific crime takes place.*2. Leftist bloggers like Markos Moulitsas blame conservatives.*3. CNN, New York Times, Washinton Post, etc.</description>

      <description>The tragedy in Tucson exposed America’s leading leftists for what they are.
Andrew Breitbart points out on Twitter that his cowardly leftist accusors, including Markos Moulitsas and Eric Boehlert, quieted down on their libelous attacks on Breitbart, Palin, Bush, and Tea Party.
These leftist cowards shut up only after it became undeniably clear that the evil bastard who shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 11 others is not a tea partier, but a deranged socialist.</description>

      <description>Update: Gateway Pundit has much more on the alleged shooter.
These appear to be the paranoid ramblings of the man in custody for shooting Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 11 others, including a federal judge, in Tucson, AZ. Lots of hard left references in his favorite books, including Mein Kampf and The Communist Manifesto. Politico’s Ben Smith calls Laughner’s writings “socialist.”
