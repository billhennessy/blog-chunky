      <description>St. Louis, MO&amp;ndash;Campaiging in Mooseknuckles, MO, today, Democrat Hillary Clinton gave supporters her strongest argument to date for an immediate, unconditional pull-out from Iraq.
&amp;ldquo;You read the news,&amp;rdquo; she shrilled to the largely silent crowd. &amp;ldquo;You read the reports the coming out of Iraq. You know what&amp;rsquo;s happened during George Bush&amp;rsquo;s war!&amp;rdquo;
The audience&amp;rsquo;s polite but blank silence indicated that they didn&amp;rsquo;t.
&amp;ldquo;You have seen Senator Durbin and several Brookings Institute scholars report from the field that the surge is pushing back the insurgents.</description>

      <description>The headline would have read, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re Gaining in Iraq,&amp;rdquo; but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to confuse any liberals for whom the &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; in Iraq is al Qaeda.
The surge is working according two liberals from the Brookings Institute writing in the New York Times. And according to Dean Barnett blogging on HughHewitt.townhall.com, their former friends on the left are ready to do to them what it appears Chuck Schumer did to the Chief Justice.</description>
