      <description>Steve McIntyre tears to shreds an anti-speech ruling by the British equivalent of the FCC, Ofcom. Ofcom ruled that a documentary &amp;ldquo;The Great Global Warming Swindle&amp;rdquo; violated rules, essentially, because the producers presented evidence contrary to the party line of the United Nations and the Labor government. In other words, in the UK, thou shalt not question global warming.
For all the details (way too involved for this blog) see McIntyre&amp;rsquo;s Climate Audit beginning here.</description>
