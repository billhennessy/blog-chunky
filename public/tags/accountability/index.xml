      <description>Leverage: don’t make deals without it.
 &amp;ndash;Donald Trump, The Art of the Deal, 1987
It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to go Machiavellian during primaries. Even during general elections after primaries. But there&amp;rsquo;s a great danger for the grassroots.

      <description>MoveOn.org is the perfect advocate for big government; neither takes responsibility for the results of its positions. In fact, they don&amp;rsquo;t even review the results. They merely congratulate themselves on victory and seek a new horror to reign down upon the world. When it comes to MoveOn&amp;rsquo;s attack on President Bush, we&amp;rsquo;re lucky that RedState is watching.
