 Markets react: DJIA plummets from +23 to –22 in seconds after S&amp;amp;P drops Spain’s debt rating. And the sovereign debt nightmare is only beginning. The UK is next. But the USA borrows more money faster than anyone, and Socio-History blog ain’t happy:
As I pointed out yesterday, US debt threatens to end the economic stabilization.</description>
