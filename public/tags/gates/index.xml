      <description>ABC News is not known as President Obama’s loudest critic. More like his Amen corner. So it’s headline screams even louder:
Defense Secretary: Libya Did Not Pose Threat to U.S., Was Not &amp;lsquo;Vital National Interest&amp;rsquo; to Intervene
The rest of Jake Tapper’s story gets more disturbing.
* The President and the Defense Secretary seem to disagree on national interest** The Secretary of State cannot articulate a consistent US policy** Hillary Clinton seems to believe that the UN is a legal alternative to the US Congress  More than week into a war that lacks even the thinnest thread of Constitutionality, Barack Obama seems clueless.</description>
