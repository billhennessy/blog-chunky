      <description>The USGS reports a strong, 6.3 earthquake in Central Italy [map of quake]. No news on major news sites yet.
UPDATE: Fox News now has banner but no story.
UPDATE: Fox News moves fast. From Sky News Service quoting Rafael Abreu Hael of U.S. Geological Survey:
 &amp;ldquo;This is a significant earthquake,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;This is a shallow quake but there is definitely a possibility of damage and even injuries. It is going to depend on what type of buildings are in the area.</description>

      <title>That Hideous Rhythm</title>

      <description>I just blogged about the bad, sad events in St. Louis, Missouri, today. A 22-year-old police officer shot to death on duty; a famous, majestic church burned.
But looking around the internet, I find bad news all over. It was one of those days when the world&amp;rsquo;s rhythms crossed into bad vibes.
Some of those vibrations shook the earth in Peru, to the tune of 8.0 on the Richter scale, killing at least 850, probably more.</description>
