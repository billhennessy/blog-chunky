      <description>I have never looked forward to the start of Lent.
Lent is a time of repentance and atonement in anticipation of the commemoration of the passion, death, and resurrection of Christ Jesus. The whole idea of repentance and atonement always bothered me.
Until now.
This year, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for Lent to begin.
First, I&amp;rsquo;ve been called to redirect my zeal away from politics and toward God. Instead of bringing people into communion with the Constitution and liberty, I&amp;rsquo;m asked to bring people to Christ and Christ to people.</description>

      <description>Fasting is probably the healthiest thing you can do for yourself. It&amp;rsquo;s also the cheapest healthy thing you can do. Unlike most diets and exercise plans, supplements, and, especially, trips to a doctor, fasting actually saves money. When you fast, you don&amp;rsquo;t eat.
Further, fasting is the simplest thing you can do to improve your physical and mental health. There are only two things to remember:
 Don&amp;rsquo;t eat. Drink some water.</description>

      <title>Glad I Won&#39;t Be Around</title>

      <description>I was about five or six the first time I heard my mom say, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m glad I won&amp;rsquo;t be around to see it.&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what she was saying. Nonetheless, it felt ominous and unsettling. I let it go.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when I heard it the second time, phrased slightly differenlty: &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t be alive when . . . .&amp;rdquo;
I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what the &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo; was. It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter.</description>
