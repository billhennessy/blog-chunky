      <description>When Obama decreed that Catholics shall support and provide chemical abortions,he wasn&amp;rsquo;t promoting women. He was shackling religion.
Totalitarian autocrats don&amp;rsquo;t cotton freedom, unless they personally granted it. Obama doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in individual liberty, but that all power and rights emanate from government. Timothy Cardinal Dolan agrees.
So it&amp;rsquo;s exciting to report that some St. Louisans are fighting back. Here&amp;rsquo;s the details:

      <description>When Barack Obama declared that Catholics must either violate their consciences or face government persecution, he wasn’t going after just Catholics. Nor was he promoting healthcare.
Barack Obama and his myrmidon Kathleen Sebelius tried to erase the First Amendment. They tried to erase religious freedom. They tried to take away yet another foundational liberty that made America America.
**And they will try again**
Unless you stop them.
But how are you going to stop them alone?</description>
