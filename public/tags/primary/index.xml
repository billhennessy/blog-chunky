      <description>You&amp;rsquo;d think being a political animal of sorts, election season would be my favorite time of year.
It&amp;rsquo;s not. I hate elections.
I hate the crappy, predictable radio ads (above all else). I know, they do it because it works. Well, not really, but I&amp;rsquo;m not going to give a free marketing statistics lesson here. (No one has any idea if the campaign formula works, because no body ever tries anything different.</description>

      <description>I was surprised to learn that Sarah Steelman conceded the GOP Senate race at 10:00. I&amp;rsquo;d talked to Todd Akin at my polling place on Tuesday morning, and he confirmed my suspicion the [Missouri](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.5,-92.5&amp;amp;spn=3.0,3.0&amp;amp;q=38.5,-92.5 (Missouri)&amp;amp;t=h) Republican race for US Senate would be close. It really wasn&amp;rsquo;t.
Mr. Akin won handily, considering the 3-way race. John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s remarkably negative, nasty, angry campaign should have made the race much closer. It didn&amp;rsquo;t. Sarah Palin&amp;lsquo;s endorsement of Ms.</description>

      <description>Rodger Cook fools no one into thinking he’s a member of the political class. He’s not. Rodger’s a human being, like the rest of us. That’s just one of the reasons that Rodger Cook has earned my personal endorsement in next Tuesday’s (March 20) Illinois primary.*

Actually, Rodger’s not so much like the rest of us. Rodger has served the people of Illinois all of his adult life. Rodger has been a police officer, a detective, a mayor, and private businessman.</description>

      <title>Who Won the New Hampshire Republican Debate?</title>

      <description>It depends on how you score. 
I see three scoring scenarios: 1. Best conservative performance 2. Best electability performance 3. Best positional performance
Conservative performance is pretty clear: whose answers appeal to conservatives? (Does not mean conservatives believed the candidate meant what he said.) This is not Tea Party scoring, either. I’m not limiting my evaluation to the 3 core Tea Party principles of Constitutionally limited government, free markets, and fiscal responsibility.</description>
