      <title>Why Is Erick Erickson Protecting Reince Priebus?</title>

      <description>UPDATE:
Welcome, Donald Trump fans! Thanks for reading.
Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s true, I have had disagreements with Erick in the past. I try to assess the situation, not just the person. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to disagree with someone on one subject and to agree with them on another.
If anything, Erick showed consistency by rescinding Trump&amp;rsquo;s invitation to Red State. Erick didn&amp;rsquo;t want the event to descend into chaos led by my friends over the Barbour episode; he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want a descent into chaos led by Donald Trump.</description>

      <description>Go Ed!
A few weeks ago, hunkered down at my laptop in my hotel room in Jacksonville, Florida. I was exhausted from seven hours of travel and a time change. But I had to take a moment to recognize Ed Martin&amp;rsquo;s commitment to all the best the Republican Party stands for.
Ed is determined to expose the GOP establishment&amp;rsquo;s willingness to do anything to destroy grassroots insurgents. Thad Cochran&amp;rsquo;s forces in Mississippi threw ethics, morality, and decency to the wind in their quest to stop a Tea Party candidate from unseating the 128-term Cochran.</description>

      <description>CORRECTION: My sincerest apologies for an inexcusable error in this post earlier. I erroneously congratulated my friend Martin Baker in the US House 1st District primary. I understand that Martin was about 500 votes short. I failed to verify information I received on the race, and I apologize for my irresponsibility.
Well, this got people talking. (See the comments.)
Yesterday was the Missouri Primary. Congratulations to Rick Stream and Jay Ashcrofton their wins in contested races for St.</description>

      <description>Shane Schoeller narrowly missed winning the job he and I wish he had: Missouri Secretary of State. Shane lost—along with every other non-incumbent Republican for a statewide office.

      <description>I Endorse Ed Martin Dear Friends,
This is an email to encourage you to remember to do all you can to get Ed Martin elected Attorney General of Missouri. I know there are a lot of races and it is easy sometimes to overlook some of the down-ticket offices. But the Attorney General is an extremely important office. He is the chief law enforcement official of the state. He is responsible for seeing to it that our laws are faithfully enforced and our constitutional rights protected.</description>

      <description>A couple weeks ago, Joe Biden made the news by declaring that the middle class in America has been getting dumped on ever since he and Obama took their oaths of office. The statement marked the first time Biden got something right since that day. What Uncle Joe failed to mention was that he has been in charge of the White House’s Middle Class Task Force since January 30, 2009.</description>

      <description>I don’t get into town to visit my dad often enough. That’s my loss.
Jack Hennessy, my dad, epitomizes what we call The Greatest Generation.
He helped raise his younger brothers and sister after their mother passed away. Jack was ten. His youngest sibling, my uncle Jim, was a newborn.
Jack Hennessy answered the call of World War II. He was a Machinist’s Mate in the Navy. He answered, again, when North Korea crossed the 34th Parallel.</description>

      <title>Excellent Commercial by Ed Martin for Missouri Attorney General</title>

      <description>Ed Martin’s new TV commercial is excellent for many fundamental marketing reasons. Ed’s energy, commitment, and love of people shines through.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzJS2bqIlyY]
Still, the commercial is a waste of time and money unless people see it.
Here’s how you can help: buy air time. If you want an Attorney General who will protect Missouri’s sovereignty and treasury, you can simply buy air time for this ad.
And there’s more you can do.</description>

      <description>Arguably, the most important battles for economic liberty in the next four years will be between states and the government in Washington. The progressives in Washington want to consolidate power and money to feed the insatiable appetite of parasites in the USA and the world.

Rex Sinquefield, the billionaire Bishop DuBourg alum who masquerades as a libertarian-ish Republican, lifted his mask this week to help Washington’s progressives steal Missouri’s autonomy and treasures.</description>

      <description>Choosing Paul Ryan as his running mate was a great Romney move. Looking ahead, Romney sees movement conservatives working hard right up to the election—even if he or his advisors continues to say stupid things. That was necessary.
SCROLL DOWN FOR TWO IMPORTANT EVENTS THIS WEEK
But it wasn’t enough to win the election and unseat America’s first anti-American president. To do that, we must find a way to win over the selfish middle.</description>

      <description>I was surprised to learn that Sarah Steelman conceded the GOP Senate race at 10:00. I&amp;rsquo;d talked to Todd Akin at my polling place on Tuesday morning, and he confirmed my suspicion the [Missouri](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.5,-92.5&amp;amp;spn=3.0,3.0&amp;amp;q=38.5,-92.5 (Missouri)&amp;amp;t=h) Republican race for US Senate would be close. It really wasn&amp;rsquo;t.
Mr. Akin won handily, considering the 3-way race. John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s remarkably negative, nasty, angry campaign should have made the race much closer. It didn&amp;rsquo;t. Sarah Palin&amp;lsquo;s endorsement of Ms.</description>

      <title>Hey, Candy Crowley: Tea Party Groups Resemble the 13 Colonies, Not the Balkans</title>

      <description>Analogies say more about the speaker than about the subject.
Candy Crowley told KMOX Radio listeners on Friday that Tea Party groups resemble the Balkans without guns.
Wrong. Crappy analogy, Candy. The diverse and autonomous, often quarrelsome,** Tea Party groups remind me of the original 13 colonies.**
The colonies were divided on just about every subject imaginable. The disagreed on slavery, on economics, on agraculture, manufacturing, cities, names &amp;ndash; name it.</description>

      <description>Is the Tea Party dead? That&amp;rsquo;s the big question this week around the Lake of the Ozarks.

First, Eric Reeve The Lake Liberal wrote this letter-to in Lake News Online. He concludes:
 We may hear of the Tea Party here and there in the future, but I doubt it will ever figure prominently in American politics again. I say we should take a moment and reflect on what it might have been as we say farewell to the once promising Tea Party movement.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, weeks ago, how many Missouri statewide offices did you expect to flip? Be honest.
Yes, there are great people running for Governor, Secretary of State, and Treasurer. And we already have a fine Lieutenant Governor Kinder running for re-election.
But numerous factors, like name recognition, experience, and Jay Nixon’s weird relationship with Republican House leadership, made a major upset unlikely. And no Republicans had stepped up to challenge Chris Koster for Attorney General.</description>

      <description>Ed Martin Jr. of St. Louis has redirected his fire to the Attorney General race, and this is great news for everyone except Chris Koster.
Back when Ed Martin was talking about running for the Republican nod to take on Claire McCaskill, I had another thought. Well, a bunch of people had another thought: Ed would make an outstanding Attorney General.

One point that I should have made before being prompted by Ed’s speech. Trading Missouri sovereignty for a few pieces of ObamaCare silver is simple cowardice. Governor Nixon, and any Republican who voted for the healthcare exchange, should be retired—on their own or in a primary.</description>

      <description>In my response to Dan Riehl’s hit piece on Ed Martin, I wrote one more line than I should have. I wrote about an establishment takeover of Big Government.
Mike Flynn, the editor of Big Government, has quietly (and not so quietly) led the fight for liberty and good government for decades. His Big Government site has been a backbone in the resurgence of our first principles.
Much more importantly to me, Mike Flynn is a friend of mine.</description>

      <description>I’ll save you some time: it’s Ed Martin.
Please Consider
I’ve met the former Missouri GOP head and former US Ambassador to Luxembourg a couple of times. Ann Wagner is smart, funny, and engaging. I think she’d make an outstanding Republican candidate for the US House. If elected, she’d serve Missouri well.
Missouri and the tea party won’t be the big winners if Ann Wagner gets the nomination, though. That distinction would go to the Missouri Republican establishment—the same establishment that the tea party hopes to reform or replace.</description>

      <description>I’m getting a lot of requests to pump news about Claire McCaskill’s comments to Democrats. According to Brian R. Hook of Missouri Watchdog, McCaskill gave Democrats a set of instructions very similar to those I usually give at the end of Tea Party rallies. (Only Claire’s instructions seem a bit less human than mine.)
Some national political scientists believe McCaskill’s Senate seat is one of the most vulnerable in 2012.</description>

      <description>Three precincts in the city of St. Louis delivered 3,800 votes for Carnahan in the last hour of counting. Wahby’s district. Wahby’s wife works for Mayor Francis Slay. They waited until they knew how many votes they needed, then they manufactured them&amp;ndash;typical Dems, in my view.
Now I ask you: how many dead or non-existent people voted in Wahby’s precincts?
Ed Martin won, and everyone knows it. City Democrats have no qualms with committing felonies to steal elections.</description>

      <description>[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1iBjVlg6lw&amp;amp;w;=480&amp;amp;h;=385] It&amp;rsquo;s been almost two years since we met. At the time, I had no idea where this was going. Or what I was doing.
I still don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, but we all know where America is headed.
Beginning Tuesday, because of your passionate, tireless efforts, America is returning to the right course to meet the destiny our founders envisioned.
On Tuesday, your vote, joined with millions of others, will turn the country around.</description>

      <description>Thirty minutes after the debate’s official end, pods of people remained in the Arnold Rec Center Sunday night: a circle in the vestibule, a half-moon in the center aisle, two or three amorphous clumps up front, the one I belonged to, and the loud groups around Ed Martin.
“Why didn’t Russ Carnahan stay and talk to people,” a young woman asked, implying a contrast with Ed Martin’s happy conversation a few feet away.</description>

      <description>Ed Martin’s launched the HealthcareFreedomPledge.com site.

Here you can find candidates who committed to protecting your right to choose your own healthcare options.
Great idea. The site contains short statements from candidates for both state and federal office who pledge to defend our basic rights.
Ask candidates in your area to sign the pledge today.</description>

      <description>The primaries are over.
I honestly believe that in the St. Louis area, the rightward-most, viable candidate won each of the key votes. The people of Missouri are in a position to make historical shifts in our Washington representation. And those shifts are just the first step and restoring America’s First Principles.

Roy Blunt is a conservative. He will be a big step up for conservatism in the Senate.</description>
