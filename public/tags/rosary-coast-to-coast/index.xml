      <description>Rosary Coast-to-Coast at the Arch in St. Louis We are in a spiritual battle for America&amp;rsquo;s soul, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been fighting it all wrong.
Politics is important. Christians should engage. But politics isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. And politics isn&amp;rsquo;t first.
 &amp;ldquo;For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and power, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places&amp;rdquo; Ephesians 6:12</description>

      <description>Please spread the word. Tweet this. Post to Facebook. If you&amp;rsquo;re Catholic, please forward to your parish office and ask for a blurb in the Sunday bulletin.
Our nation, the Catcholic Church, and the whole world needs prayer. Why? Just read this post.
St. Padre Pio&amp;rsquo;s respond to problems was, &amp;ldquo;Bring me my weapon!&amp;rdquo; His weapon was his Holy Rosary. He prayed the Rosary to combat sin and evil. And it worked!</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I missed it.
A 54-day novena for our nation. It ends on October 7 with the Rosary Coast-to-Coast. Which means it started before I learned of either. But that&amp;rsquo;s okay. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to do the novena to do say the Rosary. Just show up at any of the Rosary stations around the area at 3:00 on October 7. I&amp;rsquo;m helping organize one location at the Black Madonna Shrine in Eureka/Pacific area.</description>

      <description>The holy Rosary is a powerful weapon!
St. Josemaria Escriva
 On Sunday, October 7 at 3:30 p.m. Central (and simultaneously across the USA and the whole world), millions will say the Rosary in unison. Will you join us?
 We are at war. A war without borders, where no man is exempt but where most haven’t recognized, let alone been trained, to fight. Casualties often go unseen, but very few are left unwounded.</description>
