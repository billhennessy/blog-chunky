      <description>I gave up news for Lent.  I also stayed away from blogging. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to have fewer opinions about fewer things. When you have a lot of opinions about a lot of things, nothing is more important than anything else. But that&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous. Some things are more important than others. Some questions must be answered before others.  So I gave up news for Lent, and I might never go back.</description>
