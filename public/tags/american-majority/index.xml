      <description>I met Raz Shaver in 2010. Even though he’s many years my junior, Raz has been an insightful, patient, and indispensible to mentor in grassroots activism.

Raz continues to help me and St. Louis Tea Party Coalition from his bunker in Texas. He also helps groups like St. Louis Tea Party all around the country. Victories and 2010, those to come in 2012, owe, in a large degree, to Raz Shafer.</description>

      <description>American Majority Action deserves a huge dose of the credit for Ed Martin’s tight race for Missouri’s 3rd district in 2010. But their ground help in September and October was only the tip of the iceberg.
Dana Loesch and I met American Majority back in April. Ned Ryun, the founder and president, asked us to speak at the group’s Post-Party Summit in Kansas City. The weekend was fabulous, informative, and fun.</description>

      <description>The Cardinals are out of town. The day before Mother’s Day is always boring. (You don’t want to go into a Mother’s Day Brunch hangin’ like Saddam Hussein, right?) So spend Friday evening and/or Saturday with Dana Loesch, Bill Hennessy, and hundreds of grassroots conservative activists at;

It’s not too late to register and arrive, and everything happens at the Embassy Suites at KC International Airport:
