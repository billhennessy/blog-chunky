      <description>Donald Trump just exploded the heads of professional talkers on CNN. It was honestly funny.
Trump reached 1,237 delegates today, clinching the nomination of the Republican Party. He will be the 45th President of the United States, and his press conferences will be the most popular show on television. It will be huge, believe me. And after the press conference, Trump did something that might have sealed the deal with American voters.</description>

      <description>Perhaps the most famous of all of Karl Marx’s writings was the clause “you have nothing to lose but your chains.”
Many people still believe that human beings are chained to corporate masters. Writers like Seth Godin talk about an awakening in which workers refuse to remain cogs in someone else’s machine.
These well-meaning people (some are well-meaning, anyway) have no problem, though with giving more power to a handful of slave-masters in Washington.</description>
