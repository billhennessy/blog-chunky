      <description>Tuesday in Kansas, President Barack Obama revealed his contempt for liberty. He declared that human beings are incapable of running their own lives . . . but, somehow, other, superior human beings are capable of running their own and others’.
  He said that free markets have always failed, everywhere . . . ignoring most of the last 240 years.
He all but declared himself a Marxist.
I am depressed that America let this dangerous man into our government.</description>
