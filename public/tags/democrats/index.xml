      <description>Picture this.
Every time you leave your teenage kids home alone for a weekend, you come back to stink-eyes from your neighbors, a living room that&amp;rsquo;s a sea of empty beer cans, a yard filled with cigarette butts, and a pregnant cat.
Pretty soon, you&amp;rsquo;d stop leaving those kids to their own devices, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you? If you had to leave town, you&amp;rsquo;d find a sitter. Maybe a retired Marine uncle. Or a friendly cop to send a car by the house every half hour during the dark hours.</description>

      <description>For years voters have complained that politicians and parties say anything to get a vote. People have longed for the days of plain talk and honesty.
  Well, the Democrats passed a new platform today. Two headlines emerged:
  The Democrats rejected any reference to God.
  The Democrats rejected Jerusalem as Israel&amp;rsquo;s capital.
  The question is: can you trust them? Do Democrats really reject God and reject Jerusalem as the center of Israeli political life?</description>

      <title>Here&#39;s Why Tax Credits Kill Society</title>

      <description>Tax credits reward particular businesses or developers with tax dollars from the general population. They concentrate wealth in a few hands. Tax credits are the way politicians play the market with someone else&amp;rsquo;s money.
  
Worse, **Republicans are addicted to tax credits. **
A Missouri House Republican leader told a constituent that his party gives tax dollars to people who &amp;ldquo;spend it smarter.&amp;rdquo; Bill Clinton said the same thing in about 1992.</description>

      <title>Studies Show Most Americans Are Too Stupid to Vote</title>

      <description>The new fad among Democrats is to see how many illegal aliens they can pack into a voting booth. While we conservatives decry this illegal and anti-American grab at tyrannical power, we should take some solace in this sobering fact: those illegal aliens probably know as much about the American political system as most 13th generation Americans.
  
The fact is, most Americans are too stupid about politics to vote, which explains the 2008 election.</description>

      <title>A Former Governor and a Famous St. Louis Lawyer Indicted for Illegal Contributions to Democrat Party, and A Law Firm Changes Names in Mid-Quote</title>

      <description>Everyone else is writing about the news that former Missouri Democrat Governor, Roger Wilson and local lawyer Ed Griesedieck Jr. were indicted on federal fraud charges today.
The two allegedly made contributions to the Democrat Party (legal), and reimbursed themselves out of Missouri Employers Mutual Insurance Company’s coffers (illegal).
But that’s not the weird part. After all, election fraud is the Democrats’ principal form of amusement.
The weird part is the statement from Griesedieck’s law firm.</description>

      <title>Who Killed the American Job Machine</title>

      <description>Maureen Dowd’s having trouble slathering make-up on her favorite pigs these days. Her President—the man for whom she surrendered all pretense of intelligence, wisdom, and self-control—is flailing.
And Maureen Dowd is going all wobbly. Wobbly on Obama. Wobbly on America. Wobbly on life. Here’s an exceprt:
 On the razor’s edge of another recession; blocked at every turn by Republicans determined to slice him up at any cost; starting an unexpectedly daunting re-election bid; and puzzling over how to make a prime-time speech about infrastructure and payroll taxes soar, maybe President Obama is wishing that he had thrown the game.</description>

      <title>Simply Staggering</title>

      <description>The federal budget deficit in the month of February 2011 exceeds the deficit for all of 2007 by 40 percent.
Simply staggering.
Yet Senate Democrats refuse to cut more than a paltry $6 billion. They refuse because they seem bent on collapsing the American system – the economy, the government, and the people themselves.
But at least the Obama administration stands by with its arms folded as gasoline prices skyrocket at the their fastest pace in history.</description>

      <title>A Bad Day for Democrats -- and Terrorists</title>

      <description>Gateway Pundit provides this top-shelf story of a US F-16 taking out 30 or so al Qaeda terrorists in Iraq. It&amp;rsquo;s a thing of beauty, and it must make Democrats sick to see their well-trained comrades die under American attack.</description>

      <title>Democrats Favor Terrorists Over Constituents</title>
      <link>https://hennessysview.com/2007/07/21/democrats-favor-terrorists-over-constituents/</link>

      <description>I hyperbolize now and then, but not this time.
Democrats in the House and Senate voted to encourage criminal prosecution of Americans who report suspicious activity (Gateway Pundit). Do you know how difficult it is to formulate a more dramatic representation of that fact than the fact itself (Discerning Texan)?
I hate Democrats. Yeah, I know, you&amp;rsquo;re not supposed to &amp;ldquo;hate&amp;rdquo; anyone. But Democrats are anti-American ass hats. They breed socialism.</description>

      <title>Hillary Hysterium</title>

      <description>Senator Clinton asked the Pentagon to describe its plans to withdraw from Iraq. The Pentagon—specifically, undersecretary of defense, Eric Edelman—replied in the most appropriate manner imaginable:
 Premature and public discussion of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq reinforces enemy propaganda that the United States will abandon its allies in Iraq, much as we are perceived to have done in Vietnam, Lebanon and Somalia
 In response, Ms. Clinton displayed the kind of hysterium one associates with under-medicated paranoid schizophrenics.</description>
