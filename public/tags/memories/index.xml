      <description>Long ago in South St. Louis Mom and Dad would go to an early Mass on Sundays. Maybe 6:30, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. Anyway, it was early. They&amp;rsquo;d bring home donuts from Donut Drive-In on Chippewa.
But between the time they left for Mass and the time they returned with donuts, us kids would get into mischief. As I remember it, my oldest sister, Tee, started it.
Tee would come downstairs, go straight to the ice box, open the freezer, pull out the newish carton of Neapolitan ice cream (&amp;ldquo;newish&amp;rdquo; because Mom and Dad shopped on Thursdays), and stand over the sink eating it with a big spoon straight from the carton.</description>
