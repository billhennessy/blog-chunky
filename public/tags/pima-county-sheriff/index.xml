      <description>I am very pleased and honored to tell you this news: Trent Humphries and the good people of the Tucson Tea Party have asked me to speak at their Third Annual April Tea Party on April 30, 2011, at 11:00 am. The theme is Reduce Taxes, Spending, and Waste.
Of course, they’re not really inviting me to speak; they’re inviting the thousands of St. Louis area activists who have done so much to advance liberty and defend freedom over the past 25 months.</description>

      <description>According to an internal Department of Homeland Security memo, Jarod Lee Loughner’s mother “works for Pima County Board of Supervisors.”
In the memo, obtained by Fox News and posted on Greta Van Susteren’s blog, the DHS agent openly speculates about undue internal influence. That’s because Loughner’s arrests don’t all end with reasonable closure, if you will.
Here’s exactly what the DHS report says:
 suspect’s mother works for the Pima County Board of Supervisors* the suspect has multiple arrests &amp;hellip; But no criminal record?</description>
