      <title>Who Is Conservative?</title>

      <description>People think they&amp;rsquo;re rational, but we&amp;rsquo;re not. For example, on many issues,** Trump&amp;rsquo;s positions are almost identical to Ronald Reagan&amp;rsquo;s.** When it comes to abortion, trade, taxes, foreign policy and the military, and entitlements like Social Security, you can&amp;rsquo;t fit a dime between Reagan and Trump.
So why do people see Trump as far to the left of Reagan?
Contrasts and comparisons.
Reagan ran against George Bush and John B. Anderson.</description>

      <title>Belated Gipper Birthday Post</title>

      <description>I re-read Ronald Reagan&amp;rsquo;s announcement speech the other day.
Delivered November 13, 1979, these are the words that launched the greatest presidency of my lifetime.
Notice the natural humanity in Reagan&amp;rsquo;s words. He didn&amp;rsquo;t browbeat people with abstract concepts like the Constitution or liberty. Instead, he spoke about the real lives of ordinary Americans. And the everyday life of an America that lived up to its ideal. And notice the complete lack of pomposity, vanity, and vulgarity so prevalent in the frontrunners of 2016.</description>

      <description>I am a mess.
I am a terrible father, a crappy husband (ask my ex-wives), and a difficult employee. I do a lot of things poorly. Most things, in fact. Especially the things I &amp;ldquo;have&amp;rdquo; to do. Authority irritates me.
While I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at following plans, I write a week&amp;rsquo;s worth of blogs on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The pattern keeps me sane. Or semi-sane. I supplement those when events warrant.</description>

      <description>Ever come across a text you know, but forgot?
I did recently. This gem of a paragraph leapt off the page and into my mind:
 I believe this nation hungers for a spiritual revival; hungers to once again see honor placed above political expediency; to see government once again the protector of our liberties, not the distributor of gifts and privilege. Government should uphold and not undermine those institutions which are custodians of the very values upon which civilization is founded &amp;ndash; Faith, education and, above all, family.</description>

      <title>Why Ann Wagner Is Wrong to Attack Heritage Action</title>

      <description>Accountability? We don&amp;rsquo;t need no stinking accountability.
 No, Ann Wagner didn&amp;rsquo;t actually say that. But her comments to a 2nd District Republican committee meeting on Tuesday gave at least one attendee the impression that Mrs. Wagner opposes the idea of conservatives holding Congress accountable.
Ann Wagner Attacks the Conservative Heritage Action Rep. Ann Wagner accused the conservative Heritage Action for America of &amp;ldquo;pitting Republican against Republican&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;never attacking Dems&amp;rdquo; at the Republican meeting.</description>

      <title>Video: Ronald Reagan Wants the Transportation Empowerment Act</title>

      <description>Want to fix Missouri&amp;rsquo;s roads and cut taxes at the same time? Well, two American conservative icons showed us the way almost 50 years ago.
The Establishment likes to attack grassroots conservatives by claiming Reagan would have opposed the Tea Party. They&amp;rsquo;re wrong, of course, and the Transportation Empowerment Act tells us why.
In 1967, shortly after Ronald Reagan became governor of California, William F. Buckley Jr. asked Governor Reagan if was even possible to be an effective governor.</description>

      <title>Why GOP Pandering to Young Voters Backfires</title>
      <link>https://hennessysview.com/2013/02/25/why-gop-pandering-to-young-voters-backfires/</link>

      <description>Marco Rubio gave the Republican response to the State of the Union address for two reasons.
First, Rubio’s Cuban, and the GOP wants to court Latinos.
Second, Rubio’s relatively young, and the GOP wants to stop the bleeding when it comes to young voters.
But there’s a fundamental problem with the Republican approach, and it stems from the GOP’s least favorite discipline: behavioral science.
Young People Are Naturally Skeptical You hear about scams that target older folks all the time.</description>

      <title>Here’s My Electoral Map Prediction</title>

      <description>Yes, I’m feeling a wave toward Romney.

My gut tells me this year is a lot like 1980.
1980 Was A Dead Heat
The final Gallup poll that year had a dead heat. Time Magazine’s November 3, 1980, called the race a dead heat. So did Newsweek.
The press was hoping John B. Anderson, a former Republican Congressman running for president as an independent, would siphon votes from Reagan. He did siphon votes from Reagan, but not nearly enough.</description>

      <title>The Old Reagan Soviet Jokes Are on US</title>

      <description>Ronald Reagan loved to tell jokes about the Soviet Union.If Obama’s re-elected, though, these same jokes could be turned on the United States.

Some of them already can be.
 It&amp;rsquo;s hard to get an automobile in the United States. They are owned mainly by elite bureaucrats. It takes an average of 10 years to get a car. 1 out of 7 families owned automobiles. You have to go through a major process and put the money out in advance.</description>

      <title>This David Stockman Quote Should Scare the Hell Out of Everyone</title>

      <description>Is the US economy about to collapse worse the Greece’s?
Some, like Paul Krugman, say that it’s okay for governments to print unlimited money. Others, who have actually managed businesses, say otherwise.
**David Stockman is among the latter. He was Reagan’s budget director for a few years. He became a media sensation because of his command of numbers. **
He left the White House early, fretting over federal debt. But debt in the 1980s was as a piggy bank to Wells Fargo.</description>

      <title>Debunking the 11th Commandment</title>
      <link>https://hennessysview.com/2011/12/05/debunking-the-11th-commandment/</link>

      <description>The Gipper didn’t always follow his own commandment.
I’ve appreciated Newt Gingrich’s attitude during the 398 Republican Presidential debates. You know, his approach of refusing to attack his opponents.
He will, necessarily, change that approach a bit on the stump, but it’s been very effective so far. As Gingrich might put it, anyone on this stage will do a better job than Barack Obama.
And he’d be right.
But being right about that doesn’t mean candidates don’t have an obligation to show voters why they’re preferable to their opponents.</description>

      <title>Why Can&#39;t the Establishment Fix America&#39;s Problems?</title>

      <description>America has but one political party capable of winning races on a scale large enough to change government practices: the Republican Party.
When the GOP takes Washington (or Jefferson City), things don&amp;rsquo;t seem to get better. Wonder why?
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a little stroll down memory lane.
 &amp;ldquo;To secure the nomination, the Dewey forces spent money and made deals and promises that Taft would never make. Offers were made of Federal jobs that Delegates could not resist.</description>

      <description>Doing the right thing is hard.
Doing the right thing after years of practicing the wrong things is even harder.
  When your senate separated the fiscal responsibility provisions affecting union collective bargaining powers from a bill that previously included tax and spend provisions, you took a big step toward fiscal recovery.
For years, public sector unions have dictated states’ taxing spending policies through brute force. These unions were not elected by the people, but the people were forced to pay—or borrow—what the unions demanded.</description>

      <title>Truer Words Were Never Spoken</title>

      <description>A truer leader never walked this land
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqAgmrSimx4&amp;amp;hl;=en_US&amp;amp;fs;=1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;hl;=en]
In human relations, there is a fixed ratio between leaders and those they lead.
The people trust leaders as much as the leader trusts the people.
In my lifetime, no leader ever trusted me as much as Ronald Reagan.
And I have trusted no leader as much as I trusted him.
And we never even met.</description>
