      <description>I planned to get new brakes on my car and to rearrange the storage room in the basement with my week off between Christmas and New Year&amp;rsquo;s. Solitary tasks.
Yesterday, though, like many of you, I read about theBlog Burst for Fred Thompson. I linked to Captain&amp;rsquo;s Quarter&amp;rsquo;s (where I first read the story), then to Rick Moran and John Hawkins, who seem to have launched the effort. For the rest of the day, I found myself e-mailing friends and posting updates about the effort to raise enough money for Fred to run a commercial in Iowa lead up to the caucuses.</description>

      <description>Imagine you live on a busy street, and you have small children. You want to get a stop sign put up on one of the cross streets near your house to slow people down. You just need to know whom to talk to.
In a country like the United States where federalism has been replaced by Big Government, you probably need to get hold of your U. S. Congressman. If he&amp;rsquo;s so inclined, he&amp;rsquo;ll attach an amendment that authorizes the placement of the stop sign to some bill.</description>
