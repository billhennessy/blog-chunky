      <description>This is part III of a four-part series. Here&amp;rsquo;s partI and part II.
Why Now? Why did Holzer choose last week to out himself? Why show himself now, putting his old boss, John Brunner, in such a bad light? And right before the August 2 primary?
**Holzer has damaged Brunner&amp;rsquo;s reputation and credibility. **And Brunner spent a ton of his own money in the process, including paying $100,000 to the guy who made the video, then squealed about it.</description>

      <description>This is part II of a three-part series. Here&amp;rsquo;s part__I.
That Shadowy Paul Holzer Paul Holzer is a former Navy SEAL Lieutenant Commander and a medical student at Dartmouth in New Hampshire. (Oddly, his bio shows MD, MBA, even though is still in medical school and simultaneously working toward an MBA.) Holzer also runs a biotech 501c3 and a political consulting firm, Draper Sterling LLC. He did some work for Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign, and he was John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s chief of staff last year.</description>

      <title>John Brunner&#39;s Charade, part I</title>

      <description>Why in the world would a political operative who once worked for John Brunner out himself and expose Brunner as either a liar or a patsy two weeks before an election?
 Reggie Lampert: Of course, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to lie on your back for a while but then you can lie from any position, can&amp;rsquo;t you? &amp;ndash;Charade, 1963
 Things just got weirder in Missouri. After the stunning revelation that people associated with John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s campaign did, in fact, produce a false, negative video attacking Eric Greitens, you might be wondering what&amp;rsquo;s going on?</description>

      <description>Fredo Corleone: I&amp;rsquo;m your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! Michael Corleone: That&amp;rsquo;s the way Pop wanted it. Fredo Corleone: It ain&amp;rsquo;t the way I wanted it! I can handle things! I&amp;rsquo;m smart! Not like everybody says&amp;hellip; like dumb&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m smart and I want respect!
 —The Godfather: Part II
I&amp;rsquo;m sure John Brunner never saw himself as Fredo Corleone.
A Burning Question Did you ever ask yourself why John Brunner would release a surreptitious recording of a phone call with an opponent?</description>

      <title>Fascinating Results from Leaders Eat Last Poll</title>

      <description>This is the story of hard choices and how people resist making them.
Last week&amp;rsquo;s poll asked you to watch a video by Simon Sinek before answering two, simple, two-part questions: which Republican candidate for President and Missouri Governor is most likely and least likely to eat last?
I intended the poll to be hard. Not complicated, not long, but emotionally challenging.
Why the Poll Was Emotionally Challenging For several weeks, I have built a case for the importance of leadership.</description>

      <title>The SEAL, the Race, and the CEO</title>

      <description>In its entire history, who was the safest CEO for Apple?
In other words, if you were a corporate recruiter hired by Apple&amp;rsquo;s board to find a chief executive, whom would hire?
I&amp;rsquo;ll answer this later, but first here&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m asking.
Who Would You Recruit? In response to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post on Brunner vs. Greitens, someone asked me a similar question about Eric Greitens. The inquisitor seems to question my judgment for preferring Greitens over John Brunner.</description>

      <title>The Greater of Two Goods</title>

      <description>You know the feeling.
You support someone for office. Call this person Candidate A. You&amp;rsquo;re all in. You&amp;rsquo;ve told your friends about this great person.
Then another candidate jumps in to oppose your candidate. Let&amp;rsquo;s call this person Candidate B. This insurgent has great qualifications. You campaigned for Candidate B in another race a few years ago. You&amp;rsquo;ve talked him up. In the past, told your friends to vote for Candidate B.</description>
