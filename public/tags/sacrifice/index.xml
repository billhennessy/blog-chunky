      <description>&amp;ldquo;What did you give up for Lent?&amp;rdquo;
Ever get that one? Like it&amp;rsquo;s something you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to post on your Facebook page.
A very good priest I knew, Dom Oppenheimer, warned against revealing one&amp;rsquo;s Lenten sacrifice.
&amp;ldquo;When you tell others what you gave up for Lent, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to feel some pride,&amp;rdquo; he explained. &amp;ldquo;But pride is the worst sin.&amp;rdquo;
That actually makes a lot of sense when you think about.</description>

      <description>Today begins Lent.

Lent prepares us for the cycle of mortality and resurrection, perfected by Christ, without which life has no meaning. It’s a time of humility. We call to mind our human brokenness in hopes of making ourselves better imitators of Christ.
On Ash Wednesday, we mark ourselves with the sign of the cross in ashes. **“Remember, man, that you are dust and unto dust you shall return (Genesis 3:19).</description>
