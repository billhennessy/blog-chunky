      <description>Do you think the Clinton Crime Family whacked Antonin Scalia? You will soon if you let yourself read this and all the links. But first, a strange call I had last week.
Something Unrelated At the end of our talk, the reporter said, &amp;ldquo;do you mind if I ask you about something else? It has nothing to do with my article, and I won&amp;rsquo;t write about it.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Uh, sure,&amp;rdquo; I said.</description>

      <title>How to Act Like You Learned Something About Trump</title>

      <description>People in the media and the GOP are acting like they learned something on Friday. That&amp;rsquo;s when the Washington Post released an audio (later conjoined with video) of Donald Trump talking lewd about his exploits with women.
I say media people and Republicans are &amp;ldquo;acting&amp;rdquo; like they learned something, because they didn&amp;rsquo;t. We didn&amp;rsquo;t. Everybody who&amp;rsquo;s paid attention to the race (or pop culture) already knew how Trump is. Everybody knows Trump brags about his sexual prowess and how women melt around him.</description>

      <description>[Stream of consciousness. Please forgive errors and craziness.]
The human brain is very bad at looking to the future.
It&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to imagine a living person not being here. We naturally assume the future will be a linear progression of the recent past.
Then one of five conservative Supreme Court justices dies. And everything&amp;rsquo;s thrown into chaos.
We have only eleven months until a new president takes the oath of office.</description>
