      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably been hearing a lot about &amp;ldquo;principles&amp;rdquo; lately. Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s entire campaign centered &amp;ldquo;conservative principles&amp;rdquo; and being a &amp;ldquo;principled conservative.&amp;rdquo;
Lately, though, most of that &amp;ldquo;principles&amp;rdquo; talk is about how Donald Trump has caused good conservatives to abandon their principles.
Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s true. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to believe it.
The one principle that many conservatives have abandoned and encouraged others to abandon: keeping your word.
The lead advocate for abandoning this principle of keeping one&amp;rsquo;s word is Jonah Goldberg of National Review and the American Enterprise Institute.</description>
