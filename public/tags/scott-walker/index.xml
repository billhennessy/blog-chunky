      <description>Wisconsin The boards at Democratic Underground crackled on June 12.
 It was just announced in Wisconsin that the unprecedented recall elections of Republicans will take place August 9.

      <description>Let’s knock off the silly political correctness, here, and admit what’s going in Wisconsin. The teachers are trying collapse the system.

Threatened with sensible legislation that protects the people of Wisconsin from unsustainable and unjustified retirement benefits, these teachers decided to shut down Wisconsin’s schools.
The solution is simple. Do what Reagan did to PATCO.</description>
