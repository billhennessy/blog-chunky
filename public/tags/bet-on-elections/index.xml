      <description>“Anybody will beat Obama.”
I get some comments and see a lot of tweets about the inevitability that any Republican will win in November.
That’s frightening.
The prospect of a Republican beating Obama isn&amp;rsquo;t frightening, of course—any of the four remaining candidates would be night and day better for our future. What’s frightening is that so many people bet on the unknowable.
Except in rare cases—one candidate is caught stealing from a church weeks before the election—political elections carry too many variables for anyone to predict their results a month in advance, much less three-quarters of a year ahead.</description>
