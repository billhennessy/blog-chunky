      <description>Some people on the right say they won&amp;rsquo;t vote for Trump. Those people list various reasons, mostly about his demeanor and things he&amp;rsquo;s said in the past. They think who gets the credit is more important than what gets done. We all know people like that, don&amp;rsquo;t we?
Most of those NeverTrumpers were okay with Trump&amp;rsquo;s policies. They all love his Supreme Court list. Most of them liked Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s ideas, and Cruz&amp;rsquo;s weren&amp;rsquo;t far from Trump&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Outcomes.
NeverTrumpers seem to believe that the act of voting is a sort of magic spell that can right all past wrongs. Psychologists call this &amp;ldquo;magical thinking.&amp;rdquo; Children do it. Magical thinking is the belief that we can change the outside world with our thoughts. Think of rain dances and crossed fingers. Or, as Dr. Ben Hunt explains, Fed policy.
Father Christopher J. Pollard, writing in Catholic News Agency, destroys the NeverTrump argument in his essay &amp;ldquo;On Voting.</description>

      <description>This is for the people, like me, who realized sometime between June 2015 and June 2016 that Donald Trump is at least better than Hillary and possibly a transformational character who can reverse America&amp;rsquo;s descent into chaos.
 “A leader is a man who can adapt principles to circumstances.” – General George Patton Jr
 You might think this post is an attempt to reach #NeverTrumpers and bring them on board the Trump Train.</description>

      <title>Magical Thinking</title>

      <description>You might wonder why I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about magic so much. What if you let yourself think about magic for a moment? Your mind can make all kinds of connections. It&amp;rsquo;s as if your mind takes you on a journey inside when you think about magic. When you hear &amp;ldquo;magic,&amp;rdquo; you instantly feel like a kid, don&amp;rsquo;t you? Perhaps you can remember when magic was as real to you as your favorite pillow or a treasured blanket.</description>

      <description>The Never Trump movement tried to make a stand. It failed by a massive margin.
 &amp;ndash;Kyle Cheney, Politico
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t even close, and I feel guilty.
I don&amp;rsquo;t look at Facebook too often. I have been on Facebook lately because it&amp;rsquo;s a great vehicle for book sales, but I really don&amp;rsquo;t like it.
One problem with Facebook is that I can see what people are thinking. And so many people I know and respect think some really dumb things.</description>
