      <description>The federal budget deficit in the month of February 2011 exceeds the deficit for all of 2007 by 40 percent.
Simply staggering.
Yet Senate Democrats refuse to cut more than a paltry $6 billion. They refuse because they seem bent on collapsing the American system – the economy, the government, and the people themselves.
But at least the Obama administration stands by with its arms folded as gasoline prices skyrocket at the their fastest pace in history.</description>

Our work has just begun.

1. We let them know what’s important to us.
2. We defend them—individually and collectively—when they do the right thing.
3. We remind them of their purpose, promises, and limitations when they stray.</description>
