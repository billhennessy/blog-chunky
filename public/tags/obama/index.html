In 2012, Barack Obama got caught telling Russian Prime Minister Medvedev that he&amp;rsquo;d have more &amp;ldquo;flexibility&amp;rdquo; after the election.
Later in 2012, during a debate, Obama accused GOP candidate Mitt Romney of stoking Cold War fears against our new friends in Moscow. Obama said, “The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because…the Cold War’s been over for 20 years!” In fact, in 2012, the whole pantheon of pantsuit partiersmocked warnings about Russia.

I was in Washington, DC, over the weekend when it dawned on me that we on the right were probably wrong about Obama&amp;rsquo;s thirst for dictatorial power. Or maybe we were right, but seven years of near-dictatorial power have exhausted the would-be autocrat. He certain looks worn down, as this Time magazine side-by-side shows:

                The White House and its corrupt Department of Justice has one chance to change the election&amp;rsquo;s outcome.According to Nate Silver&amp;rsquo;s FiveThirtyEight blog, the GOP has a 62.1 percent chance of a Senate majority. With nine days left until the election, and with President Obama&amp;rsquo;s approval and likability plunging, the Democrats face a huge loss.
Apathetic Democrats Many political observers blame Democrat voter apathy, particularly among African-Americans. The black vote that swelled in 2008 and 2012 with Obama on the ballot shows signs of deflating in 2014 as it did in 2010.

Apparently, Obama didn&amp;rsquo;t bow low enough to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. Whatever happened, an &amp;ldquo;intimate&amp;rdquo; evening planned for Obama and Abdullah was abruptly cancelled after a two-hour meeting between the two leaders. A meeting intended to &amp;ldquo;mend fences&amp;rdquo; between the two men.

I picture our president, chin resting on fist, brows squeezed in childlike concentration, as he carefully chooses between jumping Putin&amp;rsquo;s piece to end the game or getting another of his pieces &amp;ldquo;kinged.&amp;rdquo;
Of course, Obama goes for the kingship.

                The fog of war is lifting from Benghazi, and what lies beneath should shame Obama’s most ardent supporters. Barack Obama choked, and Americans died.

When America came under attack, Obama panicked and froze.
When Americans under his direction pleaded for their lives, he was afraid to pull the trigger.
Here’s the emerging picture.
White House Ordered Military and CIA to Stand Down and Let Al Qaeda Kill Former Navy SEALs Ty Woods and Glen Doherty, so disgusted by the White House’s refusal to help Americans under attack, defied an order to stand down.

For over a week, Gallup has shown a tidal wave for support for Mitt Romney. Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight tried to discredit Gallup by blogging about outlier results it’s shown in past years. Here’s the conclusion Business Insider reached:
 Bottom line: Gallup swings wildly and it frequently has results not in line with other pollsters.

                A couple weeks ago, Joe Biden made the news by declaring that the middle class in America has been getting dumped on ever since he and Obama took their oaths of office. The statement marked the first time Biden got something right since that day. What Uncle Joe failed to mention was that he has been in charge of the White House’s Middle Class Task Force since January 30, 2009.

                Barack Obama’s performance was not nearly as bad as Romney’s performance was good.

Not good—terrific.
I’m not talking about his politics and policies; I’m talking Romney’s remarkable presence. Here are the four principles of presence that Romney knocked out of the park.
Command of the Facts When it came to facts—and to how those facts matter to the listeners—Mitt Romney seemed more prepared for the office of President than the President.

The smartest man in the world can’t make a gaffe, surely. When Barack Obama says something ridiculous, mean-spirited, wrongheaded, or just plain dumb, he means it.
So we know Obama considers the murders of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others mere “bumps in the road” to his re-election. Four bumps, to be precise.
When Obama says Israel is just “one of our strongest allies” in the Middle East, no longer our strongest, he means it.

What, then, do we call a person who simultaneously argues two contrary concepts?

How ‘bout “demagogue?”
A few weeks ago, Barack Obama told America’s business owners that they are not responsible for their success. “Someone else built that.”
Today, the same Obama told Mitt Romney that there not many people who consider themselves victims.
Does Mr. Obama believe that people in dire straights are not victims of circumstances?

I&amp;rsquo;m pretty good at ignoring bogus, fraudulent polls like the one CNN released tonight. In that poll, CNN announced a massive 52-46 national lead for Obama. If true, the race would be all but over.
CNN, of course, cooked the books on this one.
About one-third of voters describe themselves as independents, CNN sampled only 3% independents for its latest poll.

                If Mitt Romney applied game theory in choosing Paul Ryan, I have renewed respect for him. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why, but first a bit of background on game theory.
Game theory is a branch of social science concerned with strategic decision-making. It is most closely associated with economics. Professor John Nash, the subject of the movie A Beautiful Mind, won a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in game theory. (For a great primer on the subject, read Thinking Strategically: the competitive advantage in business, politics, and everyday life.

As Michael Dukakis told us, a fish rots from the head down. Obama surrounds himself with people who thrive on decay and death.
After four years, Obama has nothing to say for himself. Nothing. He can only cut and attack and lie and sneer and mock like a high school bully.

James Carville says overturning ObamaCare would be the best thing that could happen to Democrats. I think he’s wrong.
ObamaCare is the centerpiece of Obama’s term in office. He put all of America’s business on hold for a year to pass it. He coerced, lied, intimidated, and threatened to get the law passed.

In this post on Obama’s continuing jihad against Christianity, he answers a burning question: did human happiness exist before artificial contraception?
Put another way, is chemical birth control a natural state of humanity?
Before you answer, read the post. Think about it.

                Don’t bother blaming it on poll questions designed to lead respondents. Never mind that it’s a long way until the election. And stop whining about the White House fudging the numbers on unemployment.
The fact is that Obama’s surging at just the right time. His re-election chances are now above 50 percent. His intrade.com chances of winning are near 60 percent. And he’s raising more money than al of the Republican candidates combined.

Over the course of a week, Barack Obama made a series of so-called recess appointments. In the process, he and his henchmen in Eric Holder’s Justice Department effectively nullified the US Constitution.

 The claim that Obama is an apologist for the nation began to take shape shortly after he became president.
 An apologist is “one who speaks or writes in defense of someone or something.

No, this debt deal won’t guide the government off the road toward bankruptcy. Here’s why.
  No Entitlement Fix: In fact, it appears that entitlements aren’t touched. Entitlements are the nation’s spending problem. Not roads and bridges, not the military. Entitlements. Until we arrest and reverse growth in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, we’re spitting in the ocean.

Usually out of desperation. I’ve lied to those closest to me—those most willing to forgive the thing I lied about.
I’ve also told the truth to my own detriment. In the long run, the latter works best. In fact, telling the truth works best in the short run, too.

                An old boss of mine liked “forcing functions.” Forced us to meet delivery dates, while arbitrary dates tended to cause a “so what” attitude toward deadlines. Forcing functions like trade shows, magazine reviews, and client launches forced development teams to ship, no matter what.
Keep that in mind for a moment while we look at the Obama Administration.
Barack Obama campaigned on a promise to clip America’s wings. I know he didn’t use that term, but it was clear what he meant when he visited the Mediterranean and Germany.

 Day after day they marched, tens of thousands strong, defiant chanting demonstrators surging through the streets of Cairo, a capital unaccustomed to the shouts and echoes of dissent. The subject of their protest was the policies of Egypt’s supreme ruler, Hosni Mubarak. Some carried signs demanding his ouster. Others called for a return of long denied civil and political liberties and the enforcement of Islamic laws.

                Each day, more economists jump onto the Double-Dip bandwagon. Signs abound that the natural economic recovery that would normally follow a deep recession won’t happen. Instead, the economy is now saddled with so much debt, so many regulations, and such onerous new taxes that the Obama Administration tells us to be happy with 9.5 percent unemployment.

Barack Obama is an economic disaster of the first order.
So why all the pessimism?

Now, the Federal Reserve Board’s Open Market Committee (FOMC) is getting ready to announce that the economy is sicker than we thought.
 Although Fed policymakers still believe the basic trajectory of the economy remains one of moderate expansion, there may be more attention given to heightened dangers of a sharp slowdown.

                Democrats are planning to punish the American people with draconian, destructive legislation during the lame duck session following November’s election, according the Wall Street Journal.
 That&amp;rsquo;s why there have been signs in recent weeks that party leaders are planning an ambitious, lame-duck session to muscle through bills in December they don&amp;rsquo;t want to defend before November. Retiring or defeated members of Congress would then be able to vote for sweeping legislation without any fear of voter retaliation.

                It took almost three years of Jimmy Carter’s dangerously naive worldview before the world rushed in. By “rushed in,” I mean the Soviet Union rushed into Afghanistan, Iranian radicals rushed into the US Embassy in Tehran, and Cuban-backed communists rushed into every Central and South American country they could.
These aggressions resulted from a world perception that Jimmy Carter was unwilling to use America’s arsenal for good. Additionally, following Vietnam and observing American culture, the world surmised that:

Keeping them TARP-stuffed is the key to control. And for this intensely political president, mere influence is not enough. The White House wants to tell &amp;lsquo;em what to do.

                One of Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s first actions as president will likely involve a series of executive orders ensuring that as many abortions as possible happen. Good government protects its most vulnerable citizens; bad government kills them. Nazi Germany killed the weak, the halt, the improvident. Of course, the Nazis trained specialist to carry out these grim and evil tasks. In America, we rely on ordinary citizens to do the killing for us.

                The day after John McCain handed Barack Obama his ass on a platter at the Saddleback Forum, Obama&amp;rsquo;s paid mouthpiece, Andrea Mitchell, accused McCain of cheating (see Newsbusters). I guess going mano-a-mano with a real man is above Obama&amp;rsquo;s paygrade, too.
How pathetically consistent. Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s childishness, immaturity, and lack of accountability grow to new legendary heights every passing day. I really don&amp;rsquo;t know how people can take this brat seriously.

                TigerHawk decided to fact-check Obama&amp;rsquo;s pontifical address to his German subjects concerning the messiah&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;facts&amp;rdquo; about global warming (h/t Hackbarth). Like Hansen and Gore, Obama enjoys lying to the people. TigerHawk shows academic research that report sea levels falling, not rising, and Kansas not in a drought, but normal to exceptionally moist.
I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised to catch Obama in a lie; I am surprised that people continue to lie about global warming despite all scientific evidence (not doctored byJames Hansen) to the contrary.

                Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s most conspicuous quality, if you want to call it that, is shameless arrogance. His trip abroad was like Hitler&amp;rsquo;s tour of Italy in 1938. Before you dismiss my view as that of a party hack tearing down the opposition, read Susan Estrich&amp;rsquo;s column on FoxNews.com. (Estrich was Michael Dukakis&amp;rsquo;s campaign manager in 1988).
First, Presidential candidates rarely campaign in war zones, and for good reason. American politics traditionally sort of stopped &amp;ldquo;at the water&amp;rsquo;s edge,&amp;rdquo; as the saying went.

                Rasmussen&amp;rsquo;s presidential tracking poll shows a dead heat between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican Presidential Candidate John McCain (h/t Drudge). This poll confirms the Newsweek poll showing the two in a statistical dead heat.
Moreover, according Rasmussen, McCain enjoys higher favorability ratings than Obama.
Considering that McCain has received little media attention since the last Democrat primary in June, Obama&amp;rsquo;s 15 percentage point drop can only be blamed on Obama&amp;rsquo;s dismal performance as a candidate.

                Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s poll lead over John McCain has plummeted from 51-35 to a statistical dead-heat in less than a month.
Obama&amp;rsquo;s downward spiral has Newsweek&amp;rsquo;s headline writers asking if his glow is fading. The polls finds that more than half of voters consider Obama lying opportunist who will take any position for votes.
 Obama&amp;rsquo;s rapid drop comes at a strategically challenging moment for the Democratic candidate. Having vanquished Hillary Clinton in early June, Obama quickly went about repositioning himself for a general-election audience&amp;ndash;an unpleasant task for any nominee emerging from the pander-heavy primary contests and particularly for a candidate who&amp;rsquo;d slogged through a vigorous primary challenge in most every contest from January until June.

                Clinton Inc. will do whatever (it thinks) it takes to secure the Democrat nomination for president.
The news of the past two days has been Obama&amp;rsquo;s plagiarism. As if Obama is can&amp;rsquo;t produce his own pandering drivel. From WaPo:
 Yesterday, key Clinton supporters accused Obama of &amp;ldquo;lifting&amp;rdquo; a passage of the rousing speech he delivered to a party gathering in Milwaukee on Saturday night from Massachusetts Gov. Deval L. Patrick, a longtime friend and supporter.
