      <title>Moderna&#39;s COVID Vaccine Announcement Was Likely a Stock Manipulation Scheme</title>

      <description>Just days after I reported that an effective COVID-19 vaccine is highly unlikely, the pharmaceutical company Moderna issued a press release touting promising results from early human trials. People assumed I was wrong.
But I&amp;rsquo;m doubling down. Moderna&amp;rsquo;s vaccine trials have probably already failed, and Moderna&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;encouraging&amp;rdquo; press release proves it.
Coronavirus Vaccines Are Unlikely From The Humane Approach to Coronavirus Is to Open Up Everything published May 16:
 There Probably Won&amp;rsquo;t Be a Coronavirus Vaccine: Since early March, researchers around the world have been warning us that a vaccine for Coronavirus is highly unlikely for a straightforward reason: they have been searching for vaccines against Coronaviruses for decades and have never produced one.</description>

      <title>The Stunning Contrast Between Treatment of Hairdressers vs. Hooligans</title>
      <link>https://hennessysview.com/hairdressers-vs-hooligans/</link>

      <description>A stunning contrast. Our leaders show more patience and respect (or is it fear?) for hooligans, thugs, and terrorists than for small business owners who pay the leaders&amp;rsquo; salaries and fill their campaign coffers.
Political favoritism shown to violent street gangs will end, or the leaders will face a revolt from the right like nobody&amp;rsquo;s every seen before.
When people feel their backs are to the wall, they fight for their lives.</description>

      <title>There Are No Experts: Food, Riots, and Coronavirus</title>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s post was supposed to be about the public health crisis caused by the Coronavirus quarantine, but something more urgent came up.
The Dunning-Kruger effect is a fascinating cognitive bias that causes enormous human suffering. We see it in the prolonged over-reaction to Coronavirus and the riots following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
The experts include politicians, police, and community activists (peaceful). Non-experts include anarchists and rioters, on the one side, and anti-riot militias, on the other.</description>

      <title>New CDC Office Guidelines Ignore Science</title>

      <description>The CDC, today, issued guidelines for reopening offices that ignore medical guidance regarding masks.
The latest medical guidance, according to May 21 article in the New England Journal of Medicine reported here, says:
 Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).</description>

      <title>&#39;Masks Are Symbolic,&#39; say Dr Fauci and The New England Journal of Medicine</title>

      <description>In the past week, Dr. Anthony Fauci and the New England Journal of Medicine have admitted that masks are little more than symbols. Virtue signaling.
For those of you who shout &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo; like it&amp;rsquo;s a Tourette tick, this is from the New England Journal of Medicine on May 21, 2020:
 We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).</description>
