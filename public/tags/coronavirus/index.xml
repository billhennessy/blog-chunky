      <description>Everybody&amp;rsquo;s talking about the fourth stimulus bill. Infrastructure. Payroll tax cut. Vote by mail.
But there won&amp;rsquo;t be one.
There will be a stimulus, but it will not come from Congress. The fourth stimulus will come from you and me.
There are three reasons for this, which I will get to in a moment. But, first, do me a favor: Please share this post with your members of Congress. It&amp;rsquo;s that important.</description>

      <description>An ice cream parlor in Massachusetts closed one day after re-opening because customers treated his employees like dirt.
Owner Mark Lawrence told Fox25 Boston, via Fox News:
 “People have forgotten how to treat other human beings in the six or seven weeks that they’ve been confined to their homes,” he told the station. “They have no clue how to respect other human beings.”
 After just one day, Lawrence closed his shop.</description>

      <description>If you work for corporation, you&amp;rsquo;ve undoubtedly heard about the virtues of efficiency. And, if you&amp;rsquo;re living in America, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed shortages of stables like meat, packaged food, cleaning supplies, toilet paper, and more.

      <description>Nate Silver let the cat out of the bag.
