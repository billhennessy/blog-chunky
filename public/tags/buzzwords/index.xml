      <description>This is about Big Data.
You really can&amp;rsquo;t over-estimate what suckers business people are.
I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about people who create things or improve things. Guys like Steve Jobs and Donald Trump built great businesses. But they weren&amp;rsquo;t business people. They were builders. Running a business was a necessary evil that allowed them the freedom to build what they wanted to build. They were great businessmen because they cared about the work their companies did.</description>
