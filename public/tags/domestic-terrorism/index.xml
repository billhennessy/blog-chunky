      <description>You know this blog rarely criticizes President Trump. There&amp;rsquo;s a simple reason for that. That reason is the thousands of fraudulent journalists who create and repeat lies about President Trump every day. Like Jake &amp;ldquo;The Fake&amp;rdquo; Tapper. Those fake journalists don&amp;rsquo;t need my help.
You also know that I have criticized President Bush, Republican candidates for president, and many, many other Republicans and conservatives. I just adopted a simple rule last year: until the fake news media treats President Trump honestly and fairly, I won&amp;rsquo;t criticize my president.</description>
