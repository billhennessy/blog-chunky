      <description>I guess this makes it semi-official. Fred Thompson will announce his candidacy for President of the United States by WWW on September 6.
Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging for Fred since there were only about a dozen and a half bloggers for Fred. All I&amp;rsquo;m saying is that, when he&amp;rsquo;s trying to fill his Cabinet . . .
I expect his official entry to change the dynamics of the GOP race dramatically.</description>
