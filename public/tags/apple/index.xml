      <description>The government wants Apple to build a back door into the iPhone. Apple has refused.
I’m with Apple on this one.
This back door would allow the FBI to access the content of the San Bernardino terrorists’ phone, possibly exposing more terrorists. That would be a good thing.
But Apple never built a back door to the iPhone because no one can control the keys to such portals. If Apple builds it, every government spy agency in the world will be able to read your texts, see where you’ve been, and listen to your phone calls.</description>

      <description>People act according to what they expect.
And that, my friends, could be very bad news for the economy in 2016.
Social psychologists and usability experts both know that people&amp;rsquo;s words often conflict with their actions. This is especially true when asking people to predict their own behavior in a hypothetical.
For example, one study asked people to predict whether they would buy flowers for a charity. Eight-three percent of respondents said, &amp;ldquo;yes I would,&amp;rdquo; but only 43 percent actually did.</description>

      <description>Truth is, not all companies, not all business ideas, can make it on their own.
It’s easy to say that a good idea will automatically lead to a successful business. But it’s a lie.
Apple did not become Apple without investors. Sure, there are some examples of businesses that flourished without financial help. But not many. We’ll never know the wonderful ideas that died in their owner’s garage for lack of financing.</description>
