                            <p>I’ve gotten a lot of emails and <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2012/12/04/did-lloyd-smith-and-jo-ann-emerson-plan-this-all-along/">comments asking for more information on the special election process in Missouri’s 8th Congressional District.</a> So I went to the smartest person I know about this stuff: Frieda Keough.</p>
<p>Here’ what I learned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eddie Justice, the Chair of the 8th Congressional District will call a meeting. Anyone wanting to be appointed to run for the 8th Congressional District shows up at the meeting and will be put before the committee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eddie Justice will call the meeting probably two weeks after the Governor calls for a special Election, once JoAnn Emerson resigns, probably February 1, 2013. The special election can be anytime between April and August. Eddie will call the meeting for nomination no less than two weeks after the announcement by the Governor.</p>
<p>This is what I was told by Eddie Justice. The MRP office in Jeff City told me that I had to write a letter with my information to Eddie Justice. Eddie did not say that.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-this-differ-from-regular-elections">How Does This Differ From Regular Elections?</h3>
<ol>
<li>No need for candidates to file with Secretary of State (as far as we can tell). Candidates just show up at the committee meeting and plead their case.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.  Therefore, no petition drive is necessary.</p>
<p>3.  No primary campaigning, but there will be an election between the party nominees.</p>
<p>4.  No primary election, so people who want their views heard will have to express them to committeemen committeewomen between now and about February 20.</p>
<p>5.  Since the committee people ARE the party, “the party” has complete control. But, this crop of committee people are believed to be far more grassroots and far less establishment than in years past.</p>
<h3 id="heres-the-official-story-from-mrps-press-release">Here’s the OFFICIAL Story From MRP’s Press Release</h3>
<p>Frieda gave a lot more detail and her source is Eddie Justice, the guy who will actually preside over the committee meeting.</p>
<p>Still, you should know what the Missouri Republicans said in a press release today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>**The process for selecting a replacement:
**
The following process will occur once a vacancy is declared (in this case, it will not be until February):</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the Governor and Secretary of State are notified of the vacancy, the Secretary of State will have 24 hours to notify the 8th Congressional District GOP Committee.</p>
<p>The Governor will select the date for the election, and according to RSMO 21.110, he must provide at least 10 weeks notice.</p>
<p>Once the 8th Congressional District GOP Committee is informed of the vacancy, the Chairman of the committee will call a meeting of the committee to select a Republican candidate to run in the special election. The meeting must occur within the congressional district, and a majority of members of the committee must attend in person.</p>
<p>What we don’t know is the method of voting in the committee meeting. It’s possible that the committee will decide those rules and procedures at the meeting. If I learn more, I’ll post it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’ll leave with one more pearl from Frieda.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All seems pretty loosey goosey and could be open to different interpretations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can’t argue with that.</p>

                At the Pachyderm Club’s national convention last year, I overheard a Republican Missouri State Representative talking about HB 609. “It was the best bill I’ve ever been involved with,” she said. “Those people who just went nuts don’t know anything about insurance.”

If you read my blog, you’re likely one of the “those people,” the ignorant masses who don’t understand the fineries of the legislative process. You don’t appreciate how hard the insurance industry lobbyists worked with Jefferson City to craft a law that sold only a bit of you into slavery while ensuring the insurance companies remained profitable and your favorite Republican legislators had the money to campaign next year.

He was wrong, but** he erred on the side of life**.
It says something about a society and political mood where a man can be disqualified for loving life and God, but another man celebrated for enabling the slaughter of living children with surgical scissors through the base of their skulls.

                In an open Republican primary in Missouri’s 8th Congressional District, a solid conservative would beat an establishment &amp;ldquo;my turn&amp;rdquo; Republican, hands down. And the Missouri GOP would hate it.
That’s why I smell a rat. Would you be surprised to learn that Jo Ann Emerson and Lloyd Smith had this switcheroo planned months ago? You have to admit that the timing is suspicious:
 * Emerson wins a certain re-election * Smith announces he&#39;s stepping down as Missouri GOP Executive Director * Emerson announces she&#39;s resigning to become Queen of Lobbyists * Missouri&#39;s GOP Establishment breaks hips to tell reporters &amp;quot;Lloyd Smith&#39;s our man!
