                            <p>CNN’s Candy Crowley talks politics during KMOX’s Total Information AM every Friday. KMOX Presents Crowley as a credible source of political information.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitchy.com/2012/10/16/and-now-cnn-walks-back-false-act-of-terror-fact-check/">But Crowley’s credibility is gone</a>.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Crowley jumped into the Presidential Debate by claiming Barack Obama called the Benghazi attack “an act of terror” in the Rose Garden on September 12. In hockey, she’d have earned a game misconduct for being the third player into a fight.</p>
<p><strong>Crowley either lied or never read the transcript</strong>.</p>
<p>More importantly, <strong>why was the MODERATOR doing Obama’s bidding by side with him against Mitt Romney?</strong> That’s not moderation; it’s advocacy.</p>
<p>While Obama did use the word “terror” in that speech, he was clearly referring to 9-11-2001.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, yesterday was already a painful day for our nation as we marked the solemn memory of the 9/11 attacks.  We mourned with the families who were lost on that day.  I visited the graves of troops who made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan at the hallowed grounds of Arlington Cemetery, and had the opportunity to say thank you and visit some of our wounded warriors at Walter Reed.  And then last night, we learned the news of this attack in Benghazi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Americans, let us never, ever forget that our freedom is only sustained because there are people who are willing to fight for it, to stand up for it, and in some cases, lay down their lives for it.  Our country is only as strong as the character of our people and the service of those both civilian and military who represent us around the globe.</p>
<p>No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for. Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America.  We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act.  And make no mistake, justice will be done.</p>
<p>He did NOT refer to the Benghazi attack as an act of terror, as he claimed and as Crowley claimed. At best, he spoke of terrorism in the abstract. The fact that he blamed the video – that day and for weeks after – indicates that “terror” was not linked to Benghazi in Obama’s mind at that moment.</p>
<p>Here is Crowley trying to cover up her &ldquo;3rd man in” moment after the debate, and doing a very poor job.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=athcyCTnTTs]</p>
<p><strong>Crowley’s partisanship was disgraceful and unethical</strong>. KMOX has been a pillar of quality and credibility for generations. I would hate to see it end with this.</p>

                Analogies say more about the speaker than about the subject.
Candy Crowley told KMOX Radio listeners on Friday that Tea Party groups resemble the Balkans without guns.
Wrong. Crappy analogy, Candy. The diverse and autonomous, often quarrelsome,** Tea Party groups remind me of the original 13 colonies.**
The colonies were divided on just about every subject imaginable. The disagreed on slavery, on economics, on agraculture, manufacturing, cities, names &amp;ndash; name it.

                Barack Obama’s performance was not nearly as bad as Romney’s performance was good.

Not good—terrific.
I’m not talking about his politics and policies; I’m talking Romney’s remarkable presence. Here are the four principles of presence that Romney knocked out of the park.
Command of the Facts When it came to facts—and to how those facts matter to the listeners—Mitt Romney seemed more prepared for the office of President than the President.

                The St. Louis Cardinals were the major league team farthest west and farthest south until the 1950s. But that’s not the only reason the Redbirds built a massive flock of fans from the Alleghenies to the Rockies, and from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
The St. Louis Cardinals owe big government statism and technological innovation a big thanks, in addition to geography and great teams. The technology was radio. The big government statist?
