<p>**The problem isn&rsquo;t Barack Obama; the problem is liberalism.  **</p>
<p>Liberals believe that only experts can make intelligent decisions. They point out that the Beta Max was a superior video cassette technology to VHS, but idiot consumers were too stupid to notice.</p>
<p>Yet, for all their wisdom, the experts seem unable to manage even their affairs.</p>

<p>Liberals often point to China as an example of how fabulous a controlled economy can be. But China&rsquo;s growth was largely cosmetic. The benefit of central control of the economy and the media was that China could hide its problems; it couldn&rsquo;t fix them. As a result, we know that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/beijing-flood-sewer-photo-2012-7">Bejieng&rsquo;s sewer system doesn&rsquo;t work</a>, state-controlled <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-finds-cancer-causing-toxin-in-baby-formula-2012-7">baby formula causes cancer</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/complete-guide-to-chinas-shadow-banking-system-2012-7">Chinese banks have been playing dangerous games with collateralized debt obligations</a>-squared, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china8217s-demographic-perfect-storm-the-ultimate-growth-killer-2012-7">China&rsquo;s totalitarian population controls have produced a demographic cliff</a> that could plunge the planet into a Great Depression.</p>
<p>**Liberalism is the original good intention that paves the road to Hell.  **</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t blame all the problems with central planning on Obama.  But we can and should hold Obama to account for shoving a failed system of misery down America&rsquo;s throat.  We can point out that the man who claims government, not people, build businesses and create jobs is incapable of keeping even his softest promises of eight percent unemployment and a slowly recovering economy.  We can and should remind everyone that the man who wants to control all of the US economy struggles to manage the economics of his campaign.</p>
<p>Barack Obama did not invent the failed ideology of central planning, but as its leading proponent he deserves to suffer the same fate his policies have given to the US economy.</p>

                Ronald Reagan loved to tell jokes about the Soviet Union.If Obama’s re-elected, though, these same jokes could be turned on the United States.

Some of them already can be.
 It&amp;rsquo;s hard to get an automobile in the United States. They are owned mainly by elite bureaucrats. It takes an average of 10 years to get a car. 1 out of 7 families owned automobiles. You have to go through a major process and put the money out in advance.

RCP aggregates dozens of polls to produce its RCP average. The method has been remarkably accurate, especially at the state level.
It’s time to focus on preventing the unmitigated disaster of a second Obama term.
In 112 days, Americans will vote on whether or not to continue our experiment in self-government. If the election were held today, that experiment would be aborted.

                According to research from Missouri Education Watchdog, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) agreed to surrender Missouri&amp;rsquo;s education voice under Obama&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Race to the Top&amp;rdquo; scheme. Race to the Top was a contest in which states agreed to let the federal Department of Education, via two puppet organizations, run all of the state&amp;rsquo;s education systems. In exchange, some states were awarded money, but others were not.
Chris Nicastro, chief rock in the DESE box, applied for the grant.
