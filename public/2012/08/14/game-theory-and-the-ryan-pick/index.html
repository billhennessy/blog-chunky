                            <p>If Mitt Romney applied game theory in choosing <a href="https://paulryan.house.gov/">Paul Ryan</a>, I have renewed respect for him. I&rsquo;ll explain why, but first a bit of background on game theory.</p>
<p>Game theory is a branch of social science concerned with strategic decision-making. It is most closely associated with economics. Professor John Nash, the subject of the movie <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beautiful_mind">A Beautiful Mind</a>, won a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in game theory. (For a great primer on the subject, read <em>Thinking Strategically: the competitive advantage in business, politics, and everyday life</em>.)</p>
<p>According to professors and authors Avinash K. Dixit and Barry J. Nalebuff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a game is a situation of strategic interdependence: the outcome of your choices (strategies) depends upon the choices of another person or persons acting purposively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrowing from an example in from Dixit and Nalebuff, two-person political races are somewhat sequential. Each candidate has a choice of which road to take. If Obama takes the high road and campaigns on a ideas, Romney has a choice: he can take the high road, too, or he can take the low road and sling mud.</p>
<p>Each team must think ahead and reason backwards. He must discern his rival&rsquo;s response, his counter to that response, etc.</p>
<p>If Romney moved first, his decision tree might look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120813-200303.jpg"><img src="https://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120813-200303.jpg" alt="">
</a></p>
<p>In this case, Romney concludes that taking the low road won&rsquo;t work. Everyone already knows that Obama is a failed president, a radical who believes America needs to be &ldquo;taken down a notch.&rdquo; He also knows that negative campaigning lowers public approval of both parties. Therefore, Romney might figure that taking the high road is his only hope.</p>
<p>In this case, though, Romney didn&rsquo;t move first. Obama did. Obama, too, realizes that he&rsquo;s a failed president with a goal for America that dare not speak its name. So Obama actually moved first. Obama has been slinging mud since last fall. His minions pile on more mud&ndash;some half-truths, some complete lies&ndash;every day. He shows no sign of changing course.</p>
<p>This made Romney&rsquo;s decision easier. By asking Ryan to be his running mate, Romney can campaign on ideas, on America&rsquo;s future, on a transparent and important vision for our future. After years of hearing voters complain that they wish politicians would be more serious about the nation&rsquo;s problems and cut back on the vitriol, Romney has finally done it. He&rsquo;s left the low road to Obama and seized the high road.</p>
<p>This give Obama a choice: he can remain on the low road, and risk alienating voters who want a national debate about the legitimate role of government in our lives, or he can take the high road and risk alienating voters who would cringe at his twisted and starkly un-American vision of our future.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that Romney reasoned this way, but if he did, it bold, brilliant, and brave.</p>

                Why did murder skyrocket in Chicago as soon as Rahm Emanuel became mayor? Why have Americans become nastier and meaner since Barack Obama became president?

As Michael Dukakis told us, a fish rots from the head down. Obama surrounds himself with people who thrive on decay and death.
After four years, Obama has nothing to say for himself. Nothing. He can only cut and attack and lie and sneer and mock like a high school bully.

                Choosing Paul Ryan as his running mate was a great Romney move. Looking ahead, Romney sees movement conservatives working hard right up to the election—even if he or his advisors continues to say stupid things. That was necessary.
SCROLL DOWN FOR TWO IMPORTANT EVENTS THIS WEEK
But it wasn’t enough to win the election and unseat America’s first anti-American president. To do that, we must find a way to win over the selfish middle.

                As Obama and his myrmidons continue to make asses of themselves by arguing that no one should ever put their own capital at risk, it seems timely to point out that Solyndra, and the White House&amp;rsquo;s many gambles on hypothetical energy companies, is not a fair comparison to Mitt Romney&amp;rsquo;s work at Bain &amp;amp; Co.
   It&amp;rsquo;s legal for individuals and companies to use their own money to buy failing companies and try to save them.
