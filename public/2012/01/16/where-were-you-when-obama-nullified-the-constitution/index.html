</a>Over the course of a week, Barack Obama made a series of so-called recess appointments. In the process, he and his henchmen in Eric Holder’s Justice Department effectively <strong>nullified the US Constitution</strong>.</p>
<p>The Constitution separates the federal government into three co-equal branches: executive (president), legislative (Congress), and judicial (courts).</p>
<p>Article I of the Constitution gives each House of Congress <a href="https://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/page.aspx?pid=462">the power to make the rules</a> under which it operates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two thirds, expel a member.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the the rules each House sets for itself involves recess.  The Senate has rules governing its recesses; the House of Representatives governs its own.</p>
<p>But Obama Administration, through  the Justice Department, overruled the Senate’s rules on recesses.</p>
<p>Even the liberal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/us/politics/experts-say-obamas-recess-appointments-could-signify-end-to-a-senate-role.html?pagewanted=all">New York Times found this dictatorial move troubling</a>, recognizing that the White House has overturned a Senate rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Wednesday, Mr. Obama went where Mr. Bush had declined to go. He invoked his constitutional right to recess appointments to install four nominees — the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray, and three members of the National Labor Relations Board — effectively calling the pro forma Senate session illegitimate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its experts agree that Obama has nullified the Constitutional power of the Senate to advise on and consent to certain presidential appointments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Republicans, lawyers and parliamentary experts say the move, if it survives potential legal challenges, could herald an end to the Senate’s constitutionally guaranteed right to advice and consent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s easy for the left to shout “hyperbole” when confronted with terrifying evidence of Obama’s aims. This naked power grab exposes the sorry state of Constitutional government in the United States.  It demands drastic action by the courts and Congress and the people.</p>
<p>I see no reason why Congress, business, government employees, and citizens would obey any ruling, regulation, or requirement issued from the illegitimate offices filled without the Senate’s advice and consent. No one is required to obey an illegally appointed official, just as no one is required to obey an illegal order in the military. (In fact, a member of the military is required to _disobey_illegal orders.)</p>
<p>The most significant of these appointments is the frighteningly powerful office Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—an office with the power to fine private businesses up to $1 million <em>per day</em>.</p>
<p>I also call on all Missouri and Illinois candidates to the US House or Senate to publicly state their position on these anti-Constitutional appointments.</p>
<p>Here’s what <a href="https://cnsnews.com/blog/patrick-burke/mark-levin-we-have-constitutional-crisis">Constitutional scholar Mark Levin</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The President of the United States is trashing the Constitution now day in and day out.</p>
</blockquote>

                When he identified the three branches of government as President, House, and Senate, Was Chuck Schumer confused, or did he accurately state the Obama administration’s intent to subjugate the Judicial Branch of government? It seems the White House no longer considers the Judicial Branch the equal of the Executive.
In two cases—the Gulf oil drilling ban and Obamacare—the White House refuses to obey ruling from federal judges. In New Orleans, federal judge Martin Feldman found the White House in contempt for its re-imposition of oil drilling bans after his previous ruling to the contrary.

                The Washington Post’s headline writer made a common mistake on Sunday.

He confused “one who apologizes” with “apologist.”
An easy mistake, no doubt, for most of us. Professional headline writers should know better. So should Glenn Kessler, the author of the WP story.
 The claim that Obama is an apologist for the nation began to take shape shortly after he became president.
 An apologist is “one who speaks or writes in defense of someone or something.

                Tuesday in Kansas, President Barack Obama revealed his contempt for liberty. He declared that human beings are incapable of running their own lives . . . but, somehow, other, superior human beings are capable of running their own and others’.
  He said that free markets have always failed, everywhere . . . ignoring most of the last 240 years.
He all but declared himself a Marxist.
I am depressed that America let this dangerous man into our government.
