<p>It’s easy to say that a good idea will automatically lead to a successful business. But it’s a lie.</p>
<p><strong>Apple did not become Apple without investors</strong>. Sure, there are some examples of businesses that flourished without financial help. But not many. We’ll never know the wonderful ideas that died in their owner’s garage for lack of financing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Markkula offered to guarantee a line of credit of up to $250,000 in return for being made a one-third equity participant. Apple would incorporate, and he along with Jobs and Wozniak would each own 26% of the stock. The rest would be reserved to attract future investors. The three met in the cabana by Markkula’s swimming pool and sealed the deal. “I thought it was unlikely that Mike would ever see that $250,000 again, and I was impressed that he was willing to risk it,” Jobs recalled.</p>
<p>Isaacson, Walter (2011-10-24). Steve Jobs (p. 77). Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.. Kindle Edition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of people with ideas turn to government for investments. Why a business person with an idea would go to government for funding is obvious: poor scrutiny, below market interest rates, and (seemingly) unlimited funds. Ideas requiring big investments and heavy risks tend to seek out government help. (See <a href="https://hennessysview.com/limited-government/missouris-crap-sandwich-servers/">Aerotropolis</a>.)</p>
<p>But the private sector has its own method of bringing great, but risky, ideas to market: venture capitalists and private equity.</p>
<p>Venture capital and private equity firms pool their money together and invest in start-ups or small businesses seeking to grow, or salvage existing companies that suffer from bad management. These firms employ experts and risk-takers who help push ideas over the top.</p>
<p>**Most importantly, private equity firms are like Bailey’s Building &amp; Loan—they give us an alternative to the Mr. Potter of government. **</p>
<p><a href="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/bain-mitt.jpg"><img src="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/bain-mitt_thumb.jpg" alt="bain-mitt">
</a></p>
<p>It’s absurd to criticize Bain Capital for its practice of salvaging failing businesses. It’s absurd and silly to criticize Mitt Romney for laying off people from dying companies. <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-bussgang/a-democrats-defense-of-romney-bain-and-private-equity.html">Even some Democrats get this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should bad, poorly-managed companies be allowed to destroy value? Should fast-growing, innovative businesses receive capital and support to accelerate their growth? And should hard-working pensioners and retirees be allowed to invest their savings in an asset class that outperforms nearly every other one available? Private equity has an important role and should be lauded, not lambasted. The WSJ does a nice job of making this case <a href="https://mail.mvpub.com/owa/14.1.339.2/scripts/premium/redir.aspx?C=9a94eb71a9594d2f8867feed1d4477d5&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fonline.wsj.com%2farticle%2fSB10001424052970204879004577108500491449164.html">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am a strong proponent of business considering all stakeholders, not just shareholders, as vital corporate interests. I’ve written about <a href="https://hennessysview.com/?s=creating+shared+value">Creating Shared Value</a> in the past. I believe that mass layoffs shouldn’t happen simply to boost quarterly or annual numbers.</p>
<p>When Bain Capital bought a business, the damage had already been done. Bain didn’t buy thriving companies and gut them; it bought failing businesses and saved them.</p>
<p>Sometimes layoffs are necessary to avoid outright closure. That’s why business leaders get paid big dollars—because we rely on them to save as many jobs as possible by making brilliant strategic decisions.</p>
<p>While I have a lot of difference with Mitt Romney and with business executives who treat employees like pawns in their personal empowerment games, I believe that Romney’s actions at Bain were necessary and compassionate, not callous and self-serving.</p>
<p>Were it not for private equity firms like Bain and venture capitalists in general, ideas like the Apple II would die in Steve Jobs’s garage. Entrepreneurs, inventors, and troubled companies would have nowhere to turn except government.</p>
<p>Newt Gingrich made a big mistake attacking Romney’s role in saving failing companies. In fact, his error was so big it might have sealed the nomination for Romney.</p>

                I’m almost finished reading Walter Isaacson’s biography of Apple co-founder and genius Steve Jobs.
Jobs’s life left insanely good lessons. Some lessons instruct us on how to do things. Others warn us of bad things to avoid.
One of the good things Steve Jobs taught us: focus. Maniacal focus on things that mattered, and a pathological aversion to distractions.
One example. When Jobs returned to Apple after 10-year exile, he took stock of all the projects underway.

                The middle of the road is fine until you have to get somewhere.
I voted for Bob Dole in 1996. Yet his nomination drove me away from political activism for years.

I got out of the Navy in the fall of 1994. I watched the GOP reclaim the House with my nephew, Scott. I expected the Republicans to nominate a solid conservative who deliver a knock-out blow to the Clinton era two years later.

                The Gipper didn’t always follow his own commandment.
I’ve appreciated Newt Gingrich’s attitude during the 398 Republican Presidential debates. You know, his approach of refusing to attack his opponents.
He will, necessarily, change that approach a bit on the stump, but it’s been very effective so far. As Gingrich might put it, anyone on this stage will do a better job than Barack Obama.
And he’d be right.
But being right about that doesn’t mean candidates don’t have an obligation to show voters why they’re preferable to their opponents.
