      <description>Regardless of its ideology, that new leadership will assert public authority and demand private sacrifice. Where leaders had once been inclined to alleviate societal pressures, they will now aggravate them to command the nation&amp;rsquo;s attention.
 —William Strauss and Neil Howe: The Fourth Turning: What the Cycles of History Tell Us About America&amp;rsquo;s Next Rendezvous with Destiny

      <description>“As they reach their turn for national leadership, 13ers will produce no-nonsense winners who will excel at cunning, flexibility, and deft timing.”
 —Neil Howe and William Strauss, 13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?

      <description>Have you ever found yourself in the midst of a riot? Even if you’ve only seen riots on television, you can probably imagine how it feels to be inside one.
Imagine yourself surrounded on all sides by angry faces dressed in shabby clothes, some faces covered with bandanas or ski masks. People are chanting something you can&amp;rsquo;t quite understand, like a private joke you&amp;rsquo;re not allowed to get. Or maybe they&amp;rsquo;re chanting at you.</description>
