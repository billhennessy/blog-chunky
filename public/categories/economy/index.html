If your biggest problem involves choosing between multiple appealing jobs, everything else will seem less important. Because picking the right job is a really big deal.
For the past decade, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably worried about finding or keeping any job.

                You can actually FEEL America getting GREAT again!
ADP payroll report shows President Trump made a big down payment on his promise to be the **greatest jobs president ever. **
The economy added nearly 300,000 new jobs last month. Economists expected a rise of 190,000. It was the biggest jump in jobs in 6 years.
The jobs were the good kind of jobs Trump talks about: manufacturing, mining. Jobs with grit.

In high school (and after) we mocked the kids who took shop. The &amp;ldquo;greasers&amp;rdquo; who got credit for wrenching on cars or welding or making cabinets. It was the 1980s and shop, along with home economics, became an elective in most schools.
Until the 80s, some practical life skill class was a requirement at most American public and parochial high schools.

While you should read all of The Fourth Turning by generational historians William Strauss and Neil Howe, here&amp;rsquo;s one of their predictions for this point in time. The prediction was published in 1997:
 The economy will in time recover from its early and vertiginous reversals. Late in the Crisis, with trust and hope and urgency growing fast, it may even achieve unprecedented levels of efficiency and production.

America’s fiscal year is October 1 to September 30. With two month left in FY16, the U.S. Treasury has already paid creditors $380,925,428,211.67 in interest costs. (That’s $381 Billion) https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm
The average interest rate was just over 2%. https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/pd/avg/2016/2016_07.htm
 It is expected that the last two month’s of this fiscal year, interest costs will increase another $45 to $66 Billion. The total FY16 interest cost may be between $426 and $447 Billion.

Capitalists are like children and free marketers are like their parents.
If the free marketers neglect their duties to feed, protect, teach, and discipline capitalists, some well-meaning but inept government agency will impose itself into the parenting role, destroying the lives of everyone involved and wasting trillions of tax dollars (borrowed from future generations) in the process.

Schools and textbooks avoid the topic, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth remembering. The Plymouth and Jamestown plantations were dying under &amp;ldquo;common store&amp;rdquo; approach. Only by establishing a free market did the settlers thrive.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of Kent Dillon&amp;rsquo;s excellent story of Thanksgiving, which you can continue reading in its entirety at The Mises Institute:
By Kent Dillon
 The celebration of Thanksgiving is a celebration of plenty and appreciation of the abundance that has characterized the free enterprise, individualistic, capitalistic systems of the US.

Yesterday I blogged about the stock markets. I&amp;rsquo;d been up early to see what was going on in Europe and Asia. I was watching US futures, too.
I decided to write about what might happen. And I told you about Ben Hunt, my favorite economics writer. Ben combines remarkable knowledge of game theory and psychology with his genius in finance and economics.

                Debt is not a guarantee of future payments in full. Rather, it is a risk that creditors take, in hopes of maybe being paid tomorrow.
 The key word there is &amp;ldquo;risk.&amp;rdquo;
If you&amp;rsquo;re willing to take the risk, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a premium — in the form of interest.
But the downside of that risk is that you lose your money. And Greece just called Germany&amp;rsquo;s bluff.

The Greeks showed remarkable courage and resiliency, and their example could disrupt the entire international banking system. Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge:
 The Greek people have spoken and they said &amp;ldquo;OXI&amp;rdquo;!

Nothing.

Most cities and states that have raised their minimum wage laws to $15 will phase in the increase over five years.

                House mortgage-type instrument suggested as means to pay off national debt
Guest Post By Lee A. Presser
Interest rates have been held artificially low by the Federal Reserve since 2008. This has had the effect of hiding the true cost of increasing debt. As interest rates rise back toward 4%, the U.S. Treasury will have less money to spend on discretionary governmental functions.
The FY 2015 budget is approximately $3,900,000,000,000.00. Another way to look at that number is about $12,187.

                I hope you read Jonah Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s short article on National Review Online last week. If not, you missed the best definition of Establishment Republicans EVER!
Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s piece also exploded the myth of &amp;ldquo;pro-business&amp;rdquo; way too many conservatives believe. Conservatism isn&amp;rsquo;t pro-business, it&amp;rsquo;s pro-market. I&amp;rsquo;ll let Jonah explain:
 Just to clarify, the difference between being pro-business and pro-market is categorical. A politician who is a “friend of business” is exactly that, a guy who does favors for his friends.

 * Central Planners (government) makes a plan * The plan includes specific expectations * The expectations are never, ever, realized * A “crisis” ensues * So the planners demand more control * And create more plans * Ad hoc * Willy nilly * Capriciously * So you must wait for things to settle down to make your decision  Today’s Wall Street Journal article about the fiscal cliff demonstrates the futility of central planning:

 By the EPA&amp;rsquo;s own reckoning, the rule if implemented annually would cost American businesses $90 billion. But a related rule due to be taken up in December similarly would declare large swaths of the U.S. &amp;ldquo;closed for new business&amp;rdquo; until emissions are reduced to meet lower caps than exist today, says Anne Kolton, spokeswoman for the American Chemistry Council.

                America is suffocating under an amazing tax burden, but most Americans STILL underestimate how much their tax bill really is. That’s because Washington has done a fantastic job of forcing employers to hide most of the taxes you pay. If people had to see and deal with their total liability, the Democratic Party would be swept into the dust bin of history.

Here are some frightening facts from Rasmussen:

                The horror in Aurora, Colorado, gave President Obama a little cover last Friday. That&amp;rsquo;s because the Labor Department announced that unemployment rose in 27 states.
President Obama promised to hold unemployment under eight percent if Congress passed the stimulus package in 2009. Congress did, but Obama failed. Remember all those green jobs? They&amp;rsquo;re gone.

Unfortunately, sometimes its writers show an ignorance of basic economics in their rush to catapult Obama to a second term. Joe Weisenthal is just the latest example.
Joe tries to claim that economic recovery in the US is retarded by loss of public sector jobs.

What Joe doesn’t seem to get is this: the private sector pays for those public sector jobs.

                In a column intended to attract readers, not to promote hard economics, Rotman University economist Richard Florida declares that home ownership is terrible for the US Economy.

The problem is, like many economists,** Florida’s understanding of home ownership is 180 degrees ass-backwards**. Florida thinks that home ownership is supposed to _cause_ economic growth.
 Instead of leading to economic development, higher rates of homeownership today are associated with lower levels of it.

Some, like Paul Krugman, say that it’s okay for governments to print unlimited money. Others, who have actually managed businesses, say otherwise.
**David Stockman is among the latter. He was Reagan’s budget director for a few years. He became a media sensation because of his command of numbers. **

Today, thanks to Economic Freedom blog, we have a great video to introduce the idea of economic freedom.
Does that sound silly? I mean, aren’t Americans born with an understanding of economic freedom? And craving to preserve it?
Yes, we are.
But our schools, entertainment, press, and, above all, GOVERNMENT beats economic freedom out of us by the time we’re 14 years old.

 On the razor’s edge of another recession; blocked at every turn by Republicans determined to slice him up at any cost; starting an unexpectedly daunting re-election bid; and puzzling over how to make a prime-time speech about infrastructure and payroll taxes soar, maybe President Obama is wishing that he had thrown the game.

Sometimes the only option is humor. Maybe it’s time to laugh . . . at ourselves, at our pre-occupations, and at our president.
We elected him. And, in a republic, you always get the leadership you deserve.
Now what?
Now focus. Public displays of anger only hurt us. Anger is a tactic.
Yes, I’m angry. Furious. But acting out on anger does us no good. Instead, wise men and women focus that anger into a steely resolve to electorally destroy the cretins that destroyed America’s credit rating, liberty, and economy.

                It’s not the Balanced Budget Amendment, though that’s a good second choice.
It’s certainly not senseless and impossible ideas like impeaching Obama or suing over birth certificates.
Instead, we should push an idea that’s ripe for quick passage. It’s an idea that cheers political moderates and conservatives. And it doesn’t immediately turn off liberals.
What is it?
It’s an old idea that Jack Kemp championed for decades. It’s an idea that I’ve written about many times before.

                There’s hysteria on both sides. From Satan Sandwiches to “killing future generations,” you’d think Congress is voting on a bill to launch the US nuclear arsenal on Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.
There are reasons to distrust the deal. I distrust it.
There are great reasons todistrust the Congressional committee charged with finding more cuts.
The bill does far too little, too slowly, to prevent a credit rating cut in the near future.

** Too much borrowing ** Too much spending ** Too much government control ** Too much taxing
Those who argue that America needs to borrow, spend, regulate, and tax more are simply wrong, wrong, wrong. Their argument is absurd on its face.
The way to increase revenue to government is to increase the economic activity of the people. You do that by giving the people maximum control over their destinies.

I’m talking about your FICA score.

Your FICA score is the minimum payment on your federal loan.

Usually out of desperation. I’ve lied to those closest to me—those most willing to forgive the thing I lied about.
I’ve also told the truth to my own detriment. In the long run, the latter works best. In fact, telling the truth works best in the short run, too.

Today Obama threatened to stop Social Security payments if Congress doesn’t bend to his will on the debt ceiling.
The president told reporters that there may not be enough money to pay Social Security benefits on and after August 3rd.
But the President lies.
Revenue from taxes and other fees would cover Social Security and other payments. What won’t be covered is additional borrowing to service the country’s already outrageous debt.

Jefferson was very opposed to federal government borrowing. (He was less concerned with states borrowing.) What I love about the quote below is Jefferson’s concern for leisure time.
 &amp;ldquo;To preserve [the] independence [of the people,] we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.

Barack Obama famously refused to acknowledge American Exceptionalism in 2009. He bowed to kings and princes, then denied doing so, then bowed again and again. His White House has driven down the dollar. Timothy Geithner, Obama’s Secretary of the Treasury, warns that the world economy must “rebalance” with less reliance on America.

   Grim Voter Mood Turns Grimmer  Underpinning the gloom: Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe the economy has yet to hit bottom, a sharply higher percentage than the 53% who felt that way in January.
Wow. I think thebarrage of terrible economic news this week has people realizing that you can’t borrow your way out of a debt problem.
So far this fiscal year, the US has paid more in interest on its rapidly rising debt than it’s taken in from all corporate taxes.

                The only two people in the world who believe the economy is healthy and vibrant are Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

Now, the Federal Reserve Board’s Open Market Committee (FOMC) is getting ready to announce that the economy is sicker than we thought.
 Although Fed policymakers still believe the basic trajectory of the economy remains one of moderate expansion, there may be more attention given to heightened dangers of a sharp slowdown.

                What if: In January, a new Republican Congress is sworn in. First up on the agenda? A bi-partisan report stating that Congress must enact the most draconian tax increases and entitlement cuts in history or face total economic collapse.

That’s the scenario developing.
President Obama appointed a bi-partisan commission to make recommendations about the US government’s debt. The commission will not report out until after the November 2010 elections, but the leaders—Republican Alan Simpson and Democrat Erskine Bowles&amp;ndash;have given some warning about what we can expect.

                The stock market reacted mildly to some devastating economic news today. In fact, the stock market appears to be in denial about the state of America’s economy.
Existing home sales fell in May. As of this morning, economists expected a six percent increase.
Economists expect new home sales to be worse than existing home sales.
And economists expected home sales to fall off the table in July and for the remainder of 2010.

The call was my opportunity to break from the easy, unassailable position that things are bad and getting worse. It meant coming up with a solution or two. And solutions already find disagreement somewhere.
For over a year I’ve said that the Tea Party movement, begun out of anger, must shift its energy over time from anger to solutions.

 But there&amp;rsquo;s also one big reason why the Democrats may just pull it out- and why Republicans may not have as big an election year as we&amp;rsquo;re anticipating. And that&amp;rsquo;s because only 26% of voters in the district have a favorable opinion of Congressional Republicans, with 56% seeing them unfavorably.

 Yes, folks. Your taxes are going up, your kids are going deeper into debt, to bail out lazy, overpaid, spoiled Greek socialists. Thank your president.

                The economy was just fine before you people elected a Democrat Congress. The Democrat party has controlled government&amp;rsquo;s taxing and spending policy since January 2007. In that time, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi, now joined by Barack Obama, have presided over the greatest market and economic crash since the Great Depression.
Everything They Do Makes Things Worse
The US and world economies have been in rapid decline since Pelosi picked up the Speaker&amp;rsquo;s gavel.

                A few weeks ago, shortly after his inauguration, Barry “The President” Obama panicked: the Republicans might talk the people out of the stimulus bill.
Barry moved quickly. But Barry is an organizer, not an engineer. He’s the cheerleader, not the quarterback. He moves mobs, not nations. And when panicked, he fell apart.
Barry decided to announce that life as we know it would economically end the Day After The Stimulus Bill Is Defeated.

                For months I&amp;rsquo;ve been echoing the warnings of Peter Schiff and others: when China stops buying American debt, we&amp;rsquo;re in deep, deep trouble. The possibility for hyperflation, prices rise by double-digits on daily or weekly measures, becomes palpably high.
Even though this article from IHT failed to suprised me, I have a sick, frightened gnawing in my stomach:
 China has bought more than $1 trillion in American debt, but as the global downturn has intensified, Beijing is starting to keep more of its money at home - a shift that could pose some challenges to the U.

 Just mindblowing. Here is #44 today (via the AP):
 Obama said Tuesday the deficit appears on track to hit $1 trillion soon. Speaking to reporters after meeting with top economic aides, Obama said: &amp;quot;Potentially we&#39;ve got trillion-dollar deficits for years to come, even with the economic recovery that we are working on.&amp;quot;  If Obama really believes that the world economy will tolerate annual deficits north one trillion dollars, he will receive a belated economics education in short order.

                Let&amp;rsquo;s give credit where it&amp;rsquo;s due, if it&amp;rsquo;s due.
If Barack Obama sends a $300 billion tax cut proposal to Congress as the meat of his stimulus package, he deserves high marks.
Tax Cuts Increase Tax Revenue
A large tax cut aimed at tax payers&amp;ndash;individual and business alike&amp;ndash;will not only stimulate the economy, it will increase federal revenue, defraying the irresponsible and dangerous spending of Paulson and Bernanke. As Kennedy, Reagan, and Bush 43 understood, tax cuts, to a point, increase federal revenue.

                Entitlement is the psychological abnormality in which a person believes that he is owed an enrichment or compensation earned by suffering or activity and that society or government is obligated to pay. It is a psychological condition. It is abnormal&amp;ndash;or should be.
When a team of governors demands that the federal government steal wages and profits of the citizens and transfer those monies to state governors to dispense as the governors see fit, one wonders whether or not the disease is now the norm.

Robert Rubin abandoned the Clinton administration when a recession was unavoidable. His relief was his protege, Larry Summers.
Robert Rubin talked the Citigroup board into investing in extremely high-risk mortgage-backed securities. He also showed the bank how to carry those risks off the books&amp;ndash;exactly the way he showed Enron how to do it.

World War II cost about $2.1 trillion in 1990 dollars, which I calculate to be $3.5 trillion in 2008 (assuming 2.8 percent inflation over the period.). (San Francisco Chronicle puts a $5 trillion tag on WWI, though.) It took 50 years to pay off that debt.

Americans, faced with the choice of Marxist-socialism or republican-capitalism, a plurality chose communism.
Their moral weakness, combined with viral corruption of character, has created a majority coalition of indecisive morons known as independents, children who want government to make their decisions and butter their bread, and neo-Marxists, like Obama. We fought the Cold War for nothing.
Over the next two years, we will see the most complete change in a nation seen since the Bolshevik Revolution nearly 100 years ago in Russia:

  Since July 2008, Obama&amp;rsquo;s definition of rich has been declining at rate of 20 percent per month. Simple extrapolation shows that even minimum wage earners will face a tax increase by the time any legislation can be enacted in June 2009.

The company used those profits to fund this year&amp;rsquo;s growth investments: hiring new employees, advertising and sales, research and development. Because the company&amp;rsquo;s strategy is to fund all growth with internal profits, it keeps a healthy bank account to continue operations should a large client leave the firm or should the economy turn down.

                If you missed FoxNews&amp;rsquo;s Sunday new program, you missed a beautiful undressing of a liberal lie.
Juan Williams, defending Barack Obama, said that Americans were sick and tired of the wealthy not paying their fair share of taxes. Juan was flat out angry.
Brit Hume elegantly and calmly informed him, &amp;ldquo;Juan, the top 1 percent of income earners are paying a higher percentage of the total federal revenues than ever before.

                I just listened to a replay of today&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Meet the Press&amp;rdquo; on the radio, at least the roundtable. All talk was about the Democrat race: blacks have come far; Clintons have fallen farther. It struck me that the pundits&amp;ndash;liberal Democrats all&amp;ndash;seemed to have forgotten that another vote happens in November. Instead of deep analysis of the McCain-Obama face-off, Andrea Mitchell and Tim Russert were handicapping Obama&amp;rsquo;s cabinet picks.
Late in the segment, the team returned from 2009 as conversation turned to Hillary as veep.

                We are in for the worst economy since . . . the last time Democrats controlled Congress.
I compared three economic numbers from the January 1994, when Democrats lost control of Congress and January 2007, when they took Congress back. Then looked at what&amp;rsquo;s happened since. It isn&amp;rsquo;t pretty
Gore and Clinton were wrong, of course, because the American people did something about it: the elected Republicans.

                Back in the 1980s, it was fashionable for the left to scoff at Reagan&amp;rsquo;s economic notion that a rising tide lifts all ships. Liberal economists and politicians sneeringly referred to &amp;ldquo;trickle-down&amp;rdquo; economics as a justification for the rich to keep the poor poor. Every responsible economist knew Reagan was right, but the left in America had no accountability. Many Americans, by 1986, believed &amp;ldquo;trickle-down&amp;rdquo; economics pure evil.
Today, MSNBC took it all back.

                Democrats are more likely to be depressed than Republicans, while independents (also know as &amp;ldquo;stupid people&amp;quot;) fall somewhere in between.
In a recent [WSJ-MSNBC ](Among Republicans, 52% now expect a recession; 76% of self-identified Democrats do. Independents &amp;ndash; the swing voters who could tip the election &amp;ndash; are also pessimistic, with 61% expecting a downturn.)poll, Democrats displayed pathological levels of depression:

                America, and the world, could be looking at the worst recession since the &amp;rsquo;70s and early &amp;rsquo;80s. (Coincidentally, the last recession began simultaneously with the end of an 8 year presidency. The one before that was pretty close, too.) I remember that era.
Only the unions and the remnants of employer-worker loyalty saved my neighbors from prolonged unemployment and foreclosure. St. Louis firms tried hard to keep their doors open. We know it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so good in other industrial cities: Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Milwaukee, southern Pennsylvania.

And this from the Wall Street Journal:
 Early signs of an easing in global demand growth and swings by Wall Street traders are pushing oil away from the historic $100-a-barrel mark, at least for now.

                You&amp;rsquo;ll be hearing that mantra from the left pretty soon because poverty rates are lower under Bush than they were under Clinton. That means the Republicans can look into the camera next fall and ask Americans, &amp;ldquo;Are you better off now than you were eight years ago.&amp;rdquo; For those at the bottom of the econmic ladder, the answer must be, &amp;ldquo;Yes!&amp;rdquo;
Leftist economists still claim that supply side economics and stimulation through tax cuts are fantasies.

                The White House announced yesterday that the 2008 budget deficit would be smaller than originally projected, as will the 2007 deficit. The reasons: 1) the economy is strong and 2) tax cuts stimulate taxable economic activity.
We&amp;rsquo;ve know that that tax cuts increase federal revenue (to a point) since John F. Kennedy explained it in 1961. The Laffer Curve was the final word on the subject and should have earned Arthur Laffer the Nobel Prize for economics.
