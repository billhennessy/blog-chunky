      <description>I feel drunk but I&amp;rsquo;m sober, I&amp;rsquo;m young and I&amp;rsquo;m underpaid I&amp;rsquo;m tired but I&amp;rsquo;m working, yeah I care but I&amp;rsquo;m restless, I&amp;rsquo;m here but I&amp;rsquo;m really gone I&amp;rsquo;m wrong and I&amp;rsquo;m sorry baby
 —Alanis Morissette, One Hand In My Pocket
If your biggest problem involves choosing between multiple appealing jobs, everything else will seem less important. Because picking the right job is a really big deal.
For the past decade, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably worried about finding or keeping any job.</description>

      <description>You can actually FEEL America getting GREAT again!
ADP payroll report shows President Trump made a big down payment on his promise to be the **greatest jobs president ever. **
The economy added nearly 300,000 new jobs last month. Economists expected a rise of 190,000. It was the biggest jump in jobs in 6 years.
The jobs were the good kind of jobs Trump talks about: manufacturing, mining. Jobs with grit.</description>

      <description>I know people, and you probably do too, who are out of work from the United Steel Granite City (aka Granite City Steel) closure. It&amp;rsquo;s disheartening and depressing for people who worked hard all those years, thrown into the street because of bad trade deals and stifling regulations.
But President Trump has ordered the Keystone Pipeline renegotiated to require American steel pipes. That&amp;rsquo;s great news for our friends and neighbors in GC.</description>

      <description>Many of us are guilty. I am, too. You, probably.
In high school (and after) we mocked the kids who took shop. The &amp;ldquo;greasers&amp;rdquo; who got credit for wrenching on cars or welding or making cabinets. It was the 1980s and shop, along with home economics, became an elective in most schools.
Until the 80s, some practical life skill class was a requirement at most American public and parochial high schools.</description>

      <description>We are watching The Fourth Turning unfold before our eyes.
While you should read all of The Fourth Turning by generational historians William Strauss and Neil Howe, here&amp;rsquo;s one of their predictions for this point in time. The prediction was published in 1997:
 The economy will in time recover from its early and vertiginous reversals. Late in the Crisis, with trust and hope and urgency growing fast, it may even achieve unprecedented levels of efficiency and production.</description>

      <description>Guest post by Lee Presser.
America’s fiscal year is October 1 to September 30. With two month left in FY16, the U.S. Treasury has already paid creditors $380,925,428,211.67 in interest costs. (That’s $381 Billion) https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm
The average interest rate was just over 2%. https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/pd/avg/2016/2016_07.htm
 It is expected that the last two month’s of this fiscal year, interest costs will increase another $45 to $66 Billion. The total FY16 interest cost may be between $426 and $447 Billion.</description>

Capitalists are like children and free marketers are like their parents.
If the free marketers neglect their duties to feed, protect, teach, and discipline capitalists, some well-meaning but inept government agency will impose itself into the parenting role, destroying the lives of everyone involved and wasting trillions of tax dollars (borrowed from future generations) in the process.</description>

      <title>The Real Story of Thanksgiving</title>

      <description>Thanksgiving celebrates the Pilgrims&amp;rsquo; break from socialism.
Schools and textbooks avoid the topic, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth remembering. The Plymouth and Jamestown plantations were dying under &amp;ldquo;common store&amp;rdquo; approach. Only by establishing a free market did the settlers thrive.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of Kent Dillon&amp;rsquo;s excellent story of Thanksgiving, which you can continue reading in its entirety at The Mises Institute:
By Kent Dillon
 The celebration of Thanksgiving is a celebration of plenty and appreciation of the abundance that has characterized the free enterprise, individualistic, capitalistic systems of the US.</description>

      <description>Something weird happened in the stock market today.
Yesterday I blogged about the stock markets. I&amp;rsquo;d been up early to see what was going on in Europe and Asia. I was watching US futures, too.
I decided to write about what might happen. And I told you about Ben Hunt, my favorite economics writer. Ben combines remarkable knowledge of game theory and psychology with his genius in finance and economics.</description>

      <description>The headline is depressing, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to write it anyway:
America&amp;rsquo;s Slums Are Exploding
The story is in the Atlantic, a progressive publication. But they admit what so many Americans know: the welfare state has failed those who needed it most. And it&amp;rsquo;s failing those never needed it but were sucked into it nonetheless.
 Half a century after President Lyndon B. Johnson declared a war on poverty, the number of Americans living in slums is rising at an extraordinary pace.</description>

      <description>The world is even more fragile than it was in 2007. The big banks are bigger. Aggregate bank assets are concentrated in fewer hands. The bank derivatives books are much larger. Market liquidity is worse.
 —James Rickards, The Daily Reckoning
Well, ain’t that just dandy?
And it’s undeniably true. We were told that the 2008 financial meltdown was caused by entities that had grown too large: banks, insurance companies, corporations, derivitives.</description>

      <title>A Dangerous Misunderstanding of Debt</title>

      <description>Debt is not a guarantee of future payments in full. Rather, it is a risk that creditors take, in hopes of maybe being paid tomorrow.
 The key word there is &amp;ldquo;risk.&amp;rdquo;
If you&amp;rsquo;re willing to take the risk, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a premium — in the form of interest.
But the downside of that risk is that you lose your money. And Greece just called Germany&amp;rsquo;s bluff.

      <description>Greece has voted to reject the “troika&amp;rsquo;s” bailout terms. The people of Greece said “no” to the central banksters who encourage sovereigns to enslave themselves under mountains of debt.
The Greeks showed remarkable courage and resiliency, and their example could disrupt the entire international banking system. Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge:
 The Greek people have spoken and they said &amp;ldquo;OXI&amp;rdquo;! So congratulations Greece: for the first time you had the chance to tell the Troika, the unelected eurocrats, and the entire status quo establishment, not to mention all the banks, how you really felt and based on the most recent results, some 61% of you told it to go fuck itself.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s what happens when you raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, according to scientists:
Nothing.
Well, not nothing. All kinds of bad things happen to the economy. But nothing happens for two groups of people central to the whole debate: workers who get a bump to $15 and employers who have to bump to $15 an hour.
Most cities and states that have raised their minimum wage laws to $15 will phase in the increase over five years.</description>

      <description>House mortgage-type instrument suggested as means to pay off national debt
Guest Post By Lee A. Presser
Interest rates have been held artificially low by the Federal Reserve since 2008. This has had the effect of hiding the true cost of increasing debt. As interest rates rise back toward 4%, the U.S. Treasury will have less money to spend on discretionary governmental functions.
The FY 2015 budget is approximately $3,900,000,000,000.00. Another way to look at that number is about $12,187.</description>

      <description>Eurozone&amp;rsquo;s economy is basically in recession.
Walmart lowered expectations. Again.
The world is teetering on the edge of World War.
The US is launching Iraq War 3.0: Mission Accomplished Accomplished.
Germany&amp;rsquo;s economy is flat, and Italy and France are getting worse.
Risk is high.
Corporate debt is staggering.
The Fed&amp;rsquo;s balance sheet is a sea of monetized debt.
The central banks have nothing left to fix another crash.
And the stock markets are rocketing to record highs because of all this news.</description>

      <description>I hope you read Jonah Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s short article on National Review Online last week. If not, you missed the best definition of Establishment Republicans EVER!
Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s piece also exploded the myth of &amp;ldquo;pro-business&amp;rdquo; way too many conservatives believe. Conservatism isn&amp;rsquo;t pro-business, it&amp;rsquo;s pro-market. I&amp;rsquo;ll let Jonah explain:
 Just to clarify, the difference between being pro-business and pro-market is categorical. A politician who is a “friend of business” is exactly that, a guy who does favors for his friends.</description>

      <description>Since the 1980s, the AARP has been lobbying Congress and the White House.
The AARP has just one objective: to transfer the future income of the young and the unborn to people over 50.
Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s completely immoral. The AARP is like the father who used his kid&amp;rsquo;s Social Security Number to run up a ton of debt, then defaults. The kid is left with a permanently damaged credit rating, which prevents him from getting a good job or an affordable house.</description>

      <description>Friedrich Hayek warned more than half a century ago that central planning doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Here’s why:
 * Central Planners (government) makes a plan * The plan includes specific expectations * The expectations are never, ever, realized * A “crisis” ensues * So the planners demand more control * And create more plans * Ad hoc * Willy nilly * Capriciously * So you must wait for things to settle down to make your decision  Today’s Wall Street Journal article about the fiscal cliff demonstrates the futility of central planning:</description>

      <description>If you think federal regulation is bad today, just wait. You ain’t seen nothin’ yet.
 By the EPA&amp;rsquo;s own reckoning, the rule if implemented annually would cost American businesses $90 billion. But a related rule due to be taken up in December similarly would declare large swaths of the U.S. &amp;ldquo;closed for new business&amp;rdquo; until emissions are reduced to meet lower caps than exist today, says Anne Kolton, spokeswoman for the American Chemistry Council.</description>

      <description>America is suffocating under an amazing tax burden, but most Americans STILL underestimate how much their tax bill really is. That’s because Washington has done a fantastic job of forcing employers to hide most of the taxes you pay. If people had to see and deal with their total liability, the Democratic Party would be swept into the dust bin of history.

Here are some frightening facts from Rasmussen:</description>

      <description>The horror in Aurora, Colorado, gave President Obama a little cover last Friday. That&amp;rsquo;s because the Labor Department announced that unemployment rose in 27 states.
President Obama promised to hold unemployment under eight percent if Congress passed the stimulus package in 2009. Congress did, but Obama failed. Remember all those green jobs? They&amp;rsquo;re gone.
**The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t Barack Obama; the problem is liberalism. **

      <description>I love some things about Business Insider. Mostly its great headlines.
Unfortunately, sometimes its writers show an ignorance of basic economics in their rush to catapult Obama to a second term. Joe Weisenthal is just the latest example.
Joe tries to claim that economic recovery in the US is retarded by loss of public sector jobs.

What Joe doesn’t seem to get is this: the private sector pays for those public sector jobs.</description>

      <title>Richard Florida Has the Relationship Between Home Ownership and Growth All Wrong</title>

      <description>In a column intended to attract readers, not to promote hard economics, Rotman University economist Richard Florida declares that home ownership is terrible for the US Economy.

The problem is, like many economists,** Florida’s understanding of home ownership is 180 degrees ass-backwards**. Florida thinks that home ownership is supposed to _cause_ economic growth.
 Instead of leading to economic development, higher rates of homeownership today are associated with lower levels of it.</description>

      <description>In 2008, we heard all about the youth movement for Obama. We heard that the enormous Millennial Generation, born between 1982 and 2001, would destroy the GOP and everything America once stood for&amp;ndash;like jobs, family, faith, and hard work. And when Obama won, many believed the tales of the Obama Youth.
  
But many were wrong. Voters under 30 have had it with vague promises and glittering bullshit from that punk from Chicago.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s how Business Insider summarized the David Leohardt article:
 Basically, with no changes to current law, taxes will rise for everyone, and after tax, inflation-adjusted income for the average American will drop to 1998 levels.

      <description>Is the US economy about to collapse worse the Greece’s?
Some, like Paul Krugman, say that it’s okay for governments to print unlimited money. Others, who have actually managed businesses, say otherwise.
**David Stockman is among the latter. He was Reagan’s budget director for a few years. He became a media sensation because of his command of numbers. **
He left the White House early, fretting over federal debt. But debt in the 1980s was as a piggy bank to Wells Fargo.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I blogged about freedom envy—the feeling Americans get when they look at countries where the people get freer every day.
Today, thanks to Economic Freedom blog, we have a great video to introduce the idea of economic freedom.
Does that sound silly? I mean, aren’t Americans born with an understanding of economic freedom? And craving to preserve it?
Yes, we are.
But our schools, entertainment, press, and, above all, GOVERNMENT beats economic freedom out of us by the time we’re 14 years old.</description>

**What allows this growth? ** * Increased per student government funding * Massive private and public debt
Who benefits? * College administrators * Unions working on college campuses * Political causes that college administrators like (liberal)

In this interview with Russ Roberts, Dr. Rose discusses his new book Moral Foundations of Economic Behavior.

      <description>Maureen Dowd’s having trouble slathering make-up on her favorite pigs these days. Her President—the man for whom she surrendered all pretense of intelligence, wisdom, and self-control—is flailing.
And Maureen Dowd is going all wobbly. Wobbly on Obama. Wobbly on America. Wobbly on life. Here’s an exceprt:
 On the razor’s edge of another recession; blocked at every turn by Republicans determined to slice him up at any cost; starting an unexpectedly daunting re-election bid; and puzzling over how to make a prime-time speech about infrastructure and payroll taxes soar, maybe President Obama is wishing that he had thrown the game.</description>

      <description>Answer: Bondbonds.
Sometimes the only option is humor. Maybe it’s time to laugh . . . at ourselves, at our pre-occupations, and at our president.
We elected him. And, in a republic, you always get the leadership you deserve.
Now what?
Now focus. Public displays of anger only hurt us. Anger is a tactic.
Yes, I’m angry. Furious. But acting out on anger does us no good. Instead, wise men and women focus that anger into a steely resolve to electorally destroy the cretins that destroyed America’s credit rating, liberty, and economy.</description>

      <description>It’s not the Balanced Budget Amendment, though that’s a good second choice.
It’s certainly not senseless and impossible ideas like impeaching Obama or suing over birth certificates.
Instead, we should push an idea that’s ripe for quick passage. It’s an idea that cheers political moderates and conservatives. And it doesn’t immediately turn off liberals.
What is it?
It’s an old idea that Jack Kemp championed for decades. It’s an idea that I’ve written about many times before.</description>

      <description>There’s hysteria on both sides. From Satan Sandwiches to “killing future generations,” you’d think Congress is voting on a bill to launch the US nuclear arsenal on Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.
There are reasons to distrust the deal. I distrust it.
There are great reasons todistrust the Congressional committee charged with finding more cuts.
The bill does far too little, too slowly, to prevent a credit rating cut in the near future.</description>

      <description>Yes, the Tea Party movement influenced what went on in Washington.
No, the Tea Party is not the winner. (No one won.)
No, this debt deal won’t guide the government off the road toward bankruptcy. Here’s why.
  No Entitlement Fix: In fact, it appears that entitlements aren’t touched. Entitlements are the nation’s spending problem. Not roads and bridges, not the military. Entitlements. Until we arrest and reverse growth in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, we’re spitting in the ocean.</description>

      <description>Our present crisis is the result of:
** Too much borrowing ** Too much spending ** Too much government control ** Too much taxing
Those who argue that America needs to borrow, spend, regulate, and tax more are simply wrong, wrong, wrong. Their argument is absurd on its face.
The way to increase revenue to government is to increase the economic activity of the people. You do that by giving the people maximum control over their destinies.</description>

      <description>The headline on July 15 was knee-slapping funny:
 Obama says he’s “ready to move**” on debt ceiling. **
 Really? The man who dug a deeper debt hole in two years than anyone else did in 8—or 15—is willing to borrow more?
Say it ain’t so.
For those who believe Obama’s some sort of deficit hawk, let’s take a quick stroll down memory.
 Obama wanted to increase the debt limit by $2.</description>

      <description>Your FICO score is a number between 380 and 820 (or something like that) that banks use to determine your credit worthiness. The higher your FICO score, the better.
But that’s not what I’m talking about here.
I’m talking about your FICA score.

Your FICA score is the minimum payment on your federal loan.
You didn’t know you had a federal loan? You do.
If you’re 18 years old, you owe the federal government about $46,000.</description>

      <description>I’ll be honest with you: I’ve lied.
Usually out of desperation. I’ve lied to those closest to me—those most willing to forgive the thing I lied about.
I’ve also told the truth to my own detriment. In the long run, the latter works best. In fact, telling the truth works best in the short run, too.
So maybe Obama’s desperate. Maybe he knows that the debt ceiling debate is the beginning of the unraveling of Americum Sovieticum, his life-long dream.</description>

      <description>Obama showed his breaking point today. The stress got to him.
Today Obama threatened to stop Social Security payments if Congress doesn’t bend to his will on the debt ceiling.
The president told reporters that there may not be enough money to pay Social Security benefits on and after August 3rd.
But the President lies.
Revenue from taxes and other fees would cover Social Security and other payments. What won’t be covered is additional borrowing to service the country’s already outrageous debt.</description>

      <description>With the debt ceiling negotiations closing in, it’s worth looking to Thomas Jefferson.

Jefferson was very opposed to federal government borrowing. (He was less concerned with states borrowing.) What I love about the quote below is Jefferson’s concern for leisure time.
 &amp;ldquo;To preserve [the] independence [of the people,] we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rdquo; could refer to anything. Anything at all.
In this case, though, I&amp;rsquo;m referring to unemployment. Well, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m referring to the economy overall.
Unemployment rate rises to 9.1%, 54K jobs added « Hot Air
Obama has increased regulation, seized entire industries (auto, student loans, commercial banking, medicine), and borrowed more money faster than all previous presidents combined.
Obama is a one-dictator disaster. And an incompetent one at that.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a job, Obama made it worse.</description>

      <description>The federal budget deficit in the month of February 2011 exceeds the deficit for all of 2007 by 40 percent.
Simply staggering.
Yet Senate Democrats refuse to cut more than a paltry $6 billion. They refuse because they seem bent on collapsing the American system – the economy, the government, and the people themselves.
But at least the Obama administration stands by with its arms folded as gasoline prices skyrocket at the their fastest pace in history.</description>

      <description>Since mass murderer Fidel Castro fired thousands of Cuban government workers due to the economic unviability of Obamanomics, those set free are enjoying their independence. To the shock of the New York Times:
 “I feel useful; I’m independent,” said Ms. Álvarez, who opened a small cafe in November at her home in this scruffy town 25 miles from the capital, Havana. “When you sit down at the end of the day and look at how much you have made, you feel satisfied.</description>

      <description>Last week I wrote about Creating Shared Value. In that post, I pointed to a Harvard Business Review article by Michael Porter and Mark Kramer. If you haven’t read both my post and the Michael Porter piece, please do so now. I’ll wait.
Now that you’re up to date, let me add the Tea Party angle to this.
Though Porter did not dwell on government’s role in Creating Shared Value (CSV), he did point out that government must reform for CSV to succeed.</description>

      <description>I am a big fan of Milton Friedman. I’m also becoming a big fan of Creating Shared Value. Some believe the two values are inconsistent, but I disagree.
In 2005, Reason Magazine posted an online debate between Friedman and Whole Foods Market CEO John Mackey. The debate coincided with the 35th anniversary of Friedmans’ famous The New York Times Magazine article entitled: : &amp;ldquo;The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits.</description>

      <description>Last week, the Illinois legislature passed a massive income tax increase on individuals and businesses. Overall, it represents about a 67 percent income tax increase.
In response, neighboring states of Wisconsin and Indiana have wisely mounted massive campaigns to suck businesses and people out of Illinois. Even New Jersey’s fabulous governor, Chris Christie, plans to fish the Land o’ Lincoln for some business transplants.
One state bordering Illinois has been notoriously silent.</description>

      <description>When Barack Obama became president in January 2009, he began a campaign to weaken America. I’m not talking about military cuts; I’m speaking of America’s stature. Barack Obama famously refused to acknowledge American Exceptionalism in 2009. He bowed to kings and princes, then denied doing so, then bowed again and again. His White House has driven down the dollar. Timothy Geithner, Obama’s Secretary of the Treasury, warns that the world economy must “rebalance” with less reliance on America.</description>

      <description>Each day, more economists jump onto the Double-Dip bandwagon. Signs abound that the natural economic recovery that would normally follow a deep recession won’t happen. Instead, the economy is now saddled with so much debt, so many regulations, and such onerous new taxes that the Obama Administration tells us to be happy with 9.5 percent unemployment.

Barack Obama is an economic disaster of the first order.
So why all the pessimism?</description>

      <description>The Wall Street Journal headline is grim:
   Grim Voter Mood Turns Grimmer  Underpinning the gloom: Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe the economy has yet to hit bottom, a sharply higher percentage than the 53% who felt that way in January.
Wow. I think thebarrage of terrible economic news this week has people realizing that you can’t borrow your way out of a debt problem.
So far this fiscal year, the US has paid more in interest on its rapidly rising debt than it’s taken in from all corporate taxes.</description>

      <description>The only two people in the world who believe the economy is healthy and vibrant are Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

Now, the Federal Reserve Board’s Open Market Committee (FOMC) is getting ready to announce that the economy is sicker than we thought.
 Although Fed policymakers still believe the basic trajectory of the economy remains one of moderate expansion, there may be more attention given to heightened dangers of a sharp slowdown.</description>

      <description>What if: In January, a new Republican Congress is sworn in. First up on the agenda? A bi-partisan report stating that Congress must enact the most draconian tax increases and entitlement cuts in history or face total economic collapse.

That’s the scenario developing.
President Obama appointed a bi-partisan commission to make recommendations about the US government’s debt. The commission will not report out until after the November 2010 elections, but the leaders—Republican Alan Simpson and Democrat Erskine Bowles&amp;ndash;have given some warning about what we can expect.</description>

      <description>The stock market reacted mildly to some devastating economic news today. In fact, the stock market appears to be in denial about the state of America’s economy.
Existing home sales fell in May. As of this morning, economists expected a six percent increase.
Economists expect new home sales to be worse than existing home sales.
And economists expected home sales to fall off the table in July and for the remainder of 2010.</description>

      <description>A few weeks back, the Christian Science Monitor asked me to write an op-ed. The subject was, “If the Tea Party ran America, how would things change; and why do you think you’ll win?”
The call was my opportunity to break from the easy, unassailable position that things are bad and getting worse. It meant coming up with a solution or two. And solutions already find disagreement somewhere.
For over a year I’ve said that the Tea Party movement, begun out of anger, must shift its energy over time from anger to solutions.</description>

 &amp;ldquo;There are some parts of the global economy that are now at the risk of a double-dip recession,&amp;rdquo; said Roubini, head of Roubini Global Economics. &amp;ldquo;From here on I see things getting worse.&amp;rdquo;
 
Roubini’s comments came in response to a 376 point drop in the Dow Industrials. Nasdaq and S&amp;amp;P 500 were off significantly as well.</description>

 But there&amp;rsquo;s also one big reason why the Democrats may just pull it out- and why Republicans may not have as big an election year as we&amp;rsquo;re anticipating. And that&amp;rsquo;s because only 26% of voters in the district have a favorable opinion of Congressional Republicans, with 56% seeing them unfavorably.</description>

 Yes, folks. Your taxes are going up, your kids are going deeper into debt, to bail out lazy, overpaid, spoiled Greek socialists. Thank your president.

I didn’t tell Larry, but I think he was wrong.
Greece’s problems will hurt the American economy because Greece’s problems foreshadow a far more dangerous crash headed to America.

Currently, every family of 3 is obliged to pay over $118,000 in the next 30 years. That&amp;rsquo;s a house payment with a variable-rate.

Tax Cuts: More voters than ever now say tax cuts help the economy. Over 60 percent now agree with JFK, Reagan, Bush, and the undeniable facts of economic history: cutting taxes increases GDP and personal wealth.  A separate survey released earlier today found that 66% of voters think the president is likely to raise taxes on those who make less than $250,000 per year.</description>

      <description>The economy was just fine before you people elected a Democrat Congress. The Democrat party has controlled government&amp;rsquo;s taxing and spending policy since January 2007. In that time, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi, now joined by Barack Obama, have presided over the greatest market and economic crash since the Great Depression.
Everything They Do Makes Things Worse
The US and world economies have been in rapid decline since Pelosi picked up the Speaker&amp;rsquo;s gavel.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, shortly after his inauguration, Barry “The President” Obama panicked: the Republicans might talk the people out of the stimulus bill.
Barry moved quickly. But Barry is an organizer, not an engineer. He’s the cheerleader, not the quarterback. He moves mobs, not nations. And when panicked, he fell apart.
Barry decided to announce that life as we know it would economically end the Day After The Stimulus Bill Is Defeated.</description>

      <description>For months I&amp;rsquo;ve been echoing the warnings of Peter Schiff and others: when China stops buying American debt, we&amp;rsquo;re in deep, deep trouble. The possibility for hyperflation, prices rise by double-digits on daily or weekly measures, becomes palpably high.
Even though this article from IHT failed to suprised me, I have a sick, frightened gnawing in my stomach:
 China has bought more than $1 trillion in American debt, but as the global downturn has intensified, Beijing is starting to keep more of its money at home - a shift that could pose some challenges to the U.</description>

      <description>Obama: &amp;lsquo;Trillion-Dollar Deficits For Years&amp;rsquo; - Capital Commerce (usnews.com)
 Just mindblowing. Here is #44 today (via the AP):
 Obama said Tuesday the deficit appears on track to hit $1 trillion soon. Speaking to reporters after meeting with top economic aides, Obama said: &amp;quot;Potentially we&#39;ve got trillion-dollar deficits for years to come, even with the economic recovery that we are working on.&amp;quot;  If Obama really believes that the world economy will tolerate annual deficits north one trillion dollars, he will receive a belated economics education in short order.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s give credit where it&amp;rsquo;s due, if it&amp;rsquo;s due.
If Barack Obama sends a $300 billion tax cut proposal to Congress as the meat of his stimulus package, he deserves high marks.
Tax Cuts Increase Tax Revenue
A large tax cut aimed at tax payers&amp;ndash;individual and business alike&amp;ndash;will not only stimulate the economy, it will increase federal revenue, defraying the irresponsible and dangerous spending of Paulson and Bernanke. As Kennedy, Reagan, and Bush 43 understood, tax cuts, to a point, increase federal revenue.</description>

      <description>Entitlement is the psychological abnormality in which a person believes that he is owed an enrichment or compensation earned by suffering or activity and that society or government is obligated to pay. It is a psychological condition. It is abnormal&amp;ndash;or should be.
When a team of governors demands that the federal government steal wages and profits of the citizens and transfer those monies to state governors to dispense as the governors see fit, one wonders whether or not the disease is now the norm.</description>

      <description>In a just world where all men are created with equal rights, Bernie Madoff would be a hero. More than any other private sector figure, Bernie Madoff perfectly embodies the new American ideal.
What Madoff Did
Bernie Madoff admitted to investigators that he created an enormous Ponzi&amp;ndash;or pyramid&amp;ndash;scheme. He promised investors very high returns. He made good by paying of Round 1 investors with Round 2&amp;rsquo;s money.

As long as a new generation of investors, larger than the previous, lines up to invest, everything&amp;rsquo;s good.</description>

      <description>After a 2 year hiatus from annual predictions, here&amp;rsquo;s what I see happening in the precarious Year of our Lord Two-thousand nine:
The Dow: The Dow trades within a range of 1,000 points with a daily average closing of 8,500.
GDP and Economy: By July, everyone pretty much calls the situation &amp;ldquo;Great Depression II.&amp;rdquo; Unemployment, which declines in the first quarter, increases to more than 12 percent by fall. Gross Domestic Product by quarter:</description>

      <description>New York, Illinois, California, and a dozen other liberal states will raise taxes dramatically in the next 3 months. New York, for instance, is instituting 88 new taxes.
OPEC will cut oil output until oil reaches their target of $75 to $90 a barrel, which equates to $2.30 to $2.80 gasoline.
Obama will impose regulations and taxes that stifle growth.
The Bush capitulation to the Unamerican Auto Workers thugs will allow Detroit to limp for several months before collapsing.</description>

      <description>The United Auto Workers is the sort of extortion racket that gives crime a bad name. For 40 years&amp;ndash;since the introduction of Japanese cars in the US market&amp;ndash;these whining, overpaid slobs have bilked consumers for billions, insisting that they deserve to be overpaid simply because there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of them. America would be better off if the UAW simply ceased to exist.
They make the bogus claim that they are better workers than their non-union counterparts who assemble BMWs, Hondas, Nissans, and Toyotas.</description>

      <description>If you own US auto stock, sell.
If you work for a US auto maker, find a new job.
If you own a US-made car, start shopping.
The government is about to destroy the US auto industry, and it will cost billions of dollars.
Apparently, the White House and Congress are trying to invent an auto czar position to &amp;ldquo;oversee the restructuring of the industry [Wall Street Journal].&amp;rdquo; That means that the problems that led to the current crisis will get worse and the possible solutions to the crisis will be outlawed.</description>

Watch the video. Take notes if you need to. Thompson speaks wisdom.

Did you notice he&amp;rsquo;s not afraid to use the &amp;ldquo;d&amp;rdquo; word.
No to GM. No to Chrysler. No to Ford. No to Citi. No to everyone.
Work hard, save, invest, buy what you need. It&amp;rsquo;s that simple.

      <description>Robert Rubin was a key player in keeping Enron afloat while he and his cronies fleeced billions from employees and investors.
Robert Rubin abandoned the Clinton administration when a recession was unavoidable. His relief was his protege, Larry Summers.
Robert Rubin talked the Citigroup board into investing in extremely high-risk mortgage-backed securities. He also showed the bank how to carry those risks off the books&amp;ndash;exactly the way he showed Enron how to do it.</description>

      <description>The Internet&amp;ndash;the engine that drove year-over-year increases in sales since its inception&amp;ndash;is unable to overcome the economic malaise in America.
 For the first 23 days of November, online sales declined 4% to $8.2 billion from $8.5 billion the same time last year, according to market-research firm comScore Inc. The firm projects that retail spending online in the months of November and December will total $29.2 billion, flat from the same period last year &amp;ndash; a dreary sign for online retailers, many of which had grown accustomed to double-digit gains.</description>

      <description>The US Government is now on the hook for $7.7 trillion in bailouts and guarantees trying to stave another Great Depression [source]. Mathematically, the government&amp;rsquo;s scheme cannot work.
Bailout Costs in Perspective
World War II cost about $2.1 trillion in 1990 dollars, which I calculate to be $3.5 trillion in 2008 (assuming 2.8 percent inflation over the period.). (San Francisco Chronicle puts a $5 trillion tag on WWI, though.) It took 50 years to pay off that debt.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s hope that this weeks sees Congress and Barack&amp;rsquo;s team come to their collective senses about bailouts.
Government intervention in the private problems afflicting General Motors, Chrysler, and the finance business effective reward poor leadership. Leaving executive compensation off the table completely, the government should foster a healthy climate for business, but no more.
General Motors is not too big to fail; it&amp;rsquo;s too proud to do the right thing.</description>

      <description>The Federal Reserve Board&amp;rsquo;s Open Market Committee released the minutes of its October 28-29 meeting, today, in which some members raise the specter of economic depression extending more than 4 consecutive quarters. The report calls the present financial mess the worst in more than half a century, carefully avoiding direct references to the Great Depression.

Wall Street responded with 427 point (5.16 percent) collapse, with Citigroup leading financial stocks to a 10 percent crash.</description>

      <description>A federal bailout for the Big Three auto manufacturers will be direct transfer of wealth from the middle class to the upper class. Auto workers are, by Joe Biden&amp;rsquo;s definition, &amp;ldquo;wealthy.&amp;rdquo;
Union auto workers more than the average executive manager with an MBA and nearly 3 times the wage of the average teacher with a master&amp;rsquo;s degree. That&amp;rsquo;s why the Big 3 are dying, and that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what the unions deserve.</description>

Americans, faced with the choice of Marxist-socialism or republican-capitalism, a plurality chose communism.
Their moral weakness, combined with viral corruption of character, has created a majority coalition of indecisive morons known as independents, children who want government to make their decisions and butter their bread, and neo-Marxists, like Obama. We fought the Cold War for nothing.
Over the next two years, we will see the most complete change in a nation seen since the Bolshevik Revolution nearly 100 years ago in Russia:</description>

      <description>At the current rate of decline in Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s definition of &amp;ldquo;the rich,&amp;quot; by June 2009, anyone earning more than $20,136 a year will get a tax increase.
  Since July 2008, Obama&amp;rsquo;s definition of rich has been declining at rate of 20 percent per month. Simple extrapolation shows that even minimum wage earners will face a tax increase by the time any legislation can be enacted in June 2009.</description>

      <description>Say you work for a good-size, privately held company called X-Dyne Inc. X-Dyne has revenues of $2 billion a year and employs 4,000 people. Last year, X-Dyne&amp;rsquo;s EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) was $20,000. After taxes, the company made $11.1 million in profits.
The company used those profits to fund this year&amp;rsquo;s growth investments: hiring new employees, advertising and sales, research and development. Because the company&amp;rsquo;s strategy is to fund all growth with internal profits, it keeps a healthy bank account to continue operations should a large client leave the firm or should the economy turn down.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I participated in a roundtable discussion on the economy and how we can help our customers through the rough times ahead. At the outset, I cautioned participants against the tendency to look toward recent economic slowdowns for guidance: &amp;ldquo;this isn&amp;rsquo;t like 1991 or 2001,&amp;rdquo; I told them. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll have to go back to 1979-83 or 1929-42 to find a parallel.&amp;rdquo;
My fellows flashed looks at me, then at each other.</description>

      <description>The world&amp;rsquo;s financial systems are succumbing to fear and negative in exponentially increasing spasms that threaten shatter to more than 200 years of economic development.
Major US corporations are now on the precipice of surrender with GM&amp;rsquo;s price plummeting and GE quietly informing SEC that it fears it will not be able to obtain cash needed to maintain operations.
The Dow Industrial Average fell more than 600 points today and has lost almost half of its value since its all-time high.</description>

What will his policies be? What police-state powers will the frightened, hungry, weak American people grant?
While I reserve some degree of skepticism, I am increasingly convinced there is more than coincidence behind the eery consistency between current economic problems and those predicted by Peter d.</description>

She took $26 Million in six years from Fannie Mae by ordering accountants and internal auditors to falsify records and forge documents so ensure that she, Jim Johnson, Franklin Raines, and other Democrat executives at Fannie received maximum bonuses.

      <description>Somewhere between The Republican National Convention and the first debate on September 26, John McCain left the race. It&amp;rsquo;s as if the McCain campaign remains on suspension pending resolution of the economic crisis. Why?
It&amp;rsquo;s possible, of course, that McCain is simply inept at closing the deal. As every baseball fan knows, closers don&amp;rsquo;t grow on trees. Many fine pitchers flounder in the ninth inning with a narrow lead. They&amp;rsquo;re not all Bob Gibson.</description>

      <description>In 2004, John McCain cosponsored legislation to clean up the criminal fraud of Obama advisorFranklin Raines&amp;rsquo;s Fannie Mae. The WSJ has a round up of key Democrats defending Raines&amp;rsquo;s fraud, calling the regulators and auditors liars, and telling McCain to stuff his reforms where sun shineth not.

      <description>Barry &amp;ldquo;Himmler&amp;rdquo; Obama mocked John McCain for claiming that the administration&amp;rsquo;s $700 billion bailout plan lacked the votes to pass. At the White House meeting last Thursday, Obama was insulting and abusive to everyone in the room. The man who didn&amp;rsquo;t know that the inauguration is in January and not November appeared not to know that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t President.
Turns out McCain was right. Even after making progress in Washington last week and over the weekend, the bailout package still lacked a majority in the House.</description>

Barack Obama ratcheted up the heat on McCain and Bush, blaming them for what his friends have done to America.

      <description>Time magazine&amp;rsquo;s Karen Tumulty says that criticizing Franklin Raines&amp;ndash;the heart and soul of our current economic near-meltdown&amp;ndash;is racism because . . . Raines is black.
Therefore, criticizing any black is racism.
I&amp;rsquo;ve criticized and accused Franklin Raines brutally in the past two weeks, so I must be a regular David Dukes. Perhaps Karen Tumulty needs to change her meds.
Readers may not believe this, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize Raines was black until after I&amp;rsquo;d posted the second of my blog posts linking to Obama to Raines and Johnson and others responsible for the housing bubble and meltdown.</description>

As an executive at Fannie Mae, Franklin Raines illegally coerced his employees to falsify accounting facts so he&amp;rsquo;d get a maximum bonus. The government-backed firm used Enron-like fraud, in part at Raines&amp;rsquo;s orders, to create the largest bail-out in US history.</description>

All talk was about the Democrat race: blacks have come far; Clintons have fallen farther. It struck me that the pundits&amp;ndash;liberal Democrats all&amp;ndash;seemed to have forgotten that another vote happens in November. Instead of deep analysis of the McCain-Obama face-off, Andrea Mitchell and Tim Russert were handicapping Obama&amp;rsquo;s cabinet picks.
Late in the segment, the team returned from 2009 as conversation turned to Hillary as veep.</description>

      <description>Back in the 1980s, it was fashionable for the left to scoff at Reagan&amp;rsquo;s economic notion that a rising tide lifts all ships. Liberal economists and politicians sneeringly referred to &amp;ldquo;trickle-down&amp;rdquo; economics as a justification for the rich to keep the poor poor. Every responsible economist knew Reagan was right, but the left in America had no accountability. Many Americans, by 1986, believed &amp;ldquo;trickle-down&amp;rdquo; economics pure evil.
Today, MSNBC took it all back.</description>

Only the unions and the remnants of employer-worker loyalty saved my neighbors from prolonged unemployment and foreclosure. St. Louis firms tried hard to keep their doors open.

      <description>The White House announced yesterday that the 2008 budget deficit would be smaller than originally projected, as will the 2007 deficit. The reasons: 1) the economy is strong and 2) tax cuts stimulate taxable economic activity.
We&amp;rsquo;ve know that that tax cuts increase federal revenue (to a point) since John F. Kennedy explained it in 1961. The Laffer Curve was the final word on the subject and should have earned Arthur Laffer the Nobel Prize for economics.</description>
