Are those things really what makes life better? If so, why do so many successful people burn out? John Belushi, River Phoenix, Amy Winehouse, Janice Joplin, Michael Jackson. Is it show business? Well, look what&amp;rsquo;s happening to Elon Musk.

                One week after Archbishop Carlo Viganò released his bombshell letter, it looks obvious that Pope Francis admits the key allegation: Francis knew McCarrick to be a serial molester, and he returned McCarrick to public ministry anyway. As we&amp;rsquo;ll see later in this post, Pope Francis has a pattern of letting molesters and their protectors off the hook.
Speaks for Itself Did the pope admit to the horrendous allegations directly? Not directly.

I&amp;rsquo;m talking about his recent series of letters and clarifications regarding how Catholics should express their obedience to the pope. Jim is partially right and partially off base.
What Jim Towey Gets Right Jim is right that that conservative Catholics need to be very gracious and obedient when they challenge the pope&amp;rsquo;s formal teaching on matters like the death penalty.

                One man can confirm or deny the central allegation against Pope Francis. The Catholic Church needs that man to step up now.
In an 11-page letter by former US Nuncio (ambassador) Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, Pope Francis is accused of ignoring warnings about Cardinal Timothy McCarrick. Viganò claims he personally delivered the warning to Pope Francis in 2013. The pope allegedly ignored the warning and the dossier on McCarrick in 2013.

 Pope Francis ignored evidence of crimes and overturned punishment imposed by Pope Benedict on the wicked and disgraced Cardinal McCarrick. That&amp;rsquo;s according to a former papal nuncio and corroborated by a former first counselor to the nunciature to the United States speaking on the record. The two men have direct knowledge of the matter.
Pope Francis refused to comment on the allegations that he personally covered up McCarrick&amp;rsquo;s crimes.

Easily. And everyone who ever went through counter-espionage training knows it.
What Went Down This morning, British Prime Minister Theresa May chastised the US government. The UK freely shares anti-terrorism intelligence with the US. The US is expected to keep secrets secret.
But the US intel community is one gigantic sieve these days.

Shortly after his murder, Wikileaks posted embarrassing emails. Emails from the Democratic National Committee&amp;rsquo;s email server. Wikileaks maintains that the theft of the emails was an inside job.

Seventy-five percent of murder victims in Chicago are black.
Immediately, leftists, who apparently enjoy all the carnage in Chicago, attacked Trump&amp;rsquo;s call for fewer shootings and murders.

Today we learned that Comey flat out lied about Cheryl Mills&amp;rsquo;s immunity agreement. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) exposed Comey&amp;rsquo;s lies just minutes after Comey lied to Congress under oath about the extent of immunity granted to Mills, who was both a State Department employee and one of Hillary&amp;rsquo;s huge stable of personal attorneys.

                Hillary, Obama, and much of the Democrat Party have fomented race hatred for years. They&amp;rsquo;ve ratcheted up their lies in recent months, hoping to turn race hatred into votes. They are that cynical and self-serving.
Now, Hillary and Obama have lost control of the fire they started. Crazed, racist murderers all across the country have declared war on police officers. From Dallas, Texas, to Ballwin, Missouri, to Baton Rouge, Louisianna, Hillary has sent a message that says it&amp;rsquo;s okay to kill a cop.

                A lot of people are mad at FBI Director James Comey. Comey read a list of crimes committed by Hillary Clinton, then announced he couldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend prosecution for those crimes. On its face, it sounds like Comey caved.
Let&amp;rsquo;s play the imagine game. Imagine Comey decided to refer Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s crimes to the Department of Justice for prosecution. What would happen?
First, you&amp;rsquo;d never hear about it. The FBI and the DOJ don&amp;rsquo;t discuss active criminal investigations.

Hillary famously kept an email server in her private bedroom where it was safe from being used as Bill&amp;rsquo;s YouPorn hub. (I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure Bill Clinton hasn&amp;rsquo;t visited the inside of his wife&amp;rsquo;s sleeping chamber in the 21st century.)
Being plugged into the internet, though, and lacking even the most rudimentary security, Hillary&amp;rsquo;s server was exposed to the prying eyes of Chinese, North Korean, Russian, and Anonymous spies.

Lacy Clay, speaking from a private island in the Carribean, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Michael Brown was murdered. Clay knew or should have known the effect of his words: more violence.

                The incompetent Sheriff Dupnik of Pima County Arizona has intimidated speakers in an attempt to shut down the Tucson Tea Party.
Now, Tucson’s asking for our help. Jennifer Humphries wrote to Gateway Pundit Jim Hoft. She asked Jim of his help defending the First Amendment rights of the people of Tucson. Those rights are under assault from an incompetent and irresponsible sheriff who has now turned to intimidation to silence dissent.

If you’re an American leftist, you might double down by issuing even more death threats to even more people.
That’s what’ happening right now in America. Death threats are pouring into Trent Humphries, Tucson Tea Party organizer, Dana Loesch, Sarah Palin (who vows not to be silenced), Glenn Beck, and more.

Their theorem is: vitriolic rhetoric inspires conservatives to act out in violence.
Unfortunately for the loony left, there was no evidence to support their theorem. The evidence they falsely pointed to—Jarod Lee Loughner’s deranged murder rampage in Tucson—was determined to be a lie only hours after the event.

In what seems to have been a coordinated attack, Riverfront Times and several progressive blogs and web sites ascribed culpability for the crime to St. Louis Tea Partyers. At one point, Chad Garrison of RFT flatly stated that the suspect “fit the description” of a tea partyer, a statement he later attempted to soften by claiming that firebombing is “too sane” a crime for Tea Partyers.

Background
A Democrat member of Congress assaulted a college student. The assault, shown on two video angles, was unprovoked (unless asking a simple, closed question is now cause for violence) andcontinuing long past the point at which the victim said stop.

                Today&amp;rsquo;s Wall Street Journal directly contradict&amp;rsquo;s Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s claim to have never discussed his Senate replacement:
 Barack Obama had begun thinking about his Senate successor even before the presidential election, and dispatched Rahm Emanuel days after the vote to contact aides of Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich to begin talking up Mr. Obama&amp;rsquo;s preferred candidates, associates of Mr. Emanuel said this weekend.
 Remember that Obama also claimed that no one on his staff or acting on his behalf discussed the seat with Blago.

Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich did the perp walk for his Chicago neighbors this morning. Others have written plenty about the facts of the indictment (here, here, here, here, and here). You should know two things:
1. There&amp;rsquo;s a chance Obama will pardon Blagojevich before he goes to court. Why? Because Obama is too close not to. Blagojevich is NOT AN HONORABLE CROOK.

Robert Rubin talked the Citigroup board into investing in extremely high-risk mortgage-backed securities. He also showed the bank how to carry those risks off the books&amp;ndash;exactly the way he showed Enron how to do it.

Something happened on the way to the coronation: the truth hit Barack Obama square in the face.
Noam Scheiber of The New Republic previously dismissed the NAFTA-Canuk story, now admits the story has legs:
 Two things make it problematic for the Obama campaign: 1.) The sudden appearance of this lurid-sounding memo written by a Canadian consular official. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s particularly revealing&amp;ndash;as I said this morning, it reflects what the Canadians thought they heard from Goolsbee; there are, significantly, no direct quotes.

Yahoo! calls Belichick a &amp;ldquo;sore loser.&amp;rdquo; 
 Because Bill Belichick wanted to go hide when he lost, the field ended up being flooded with people, and the officials had to clear the area before the Giants could take their final snap and make it official. When you lose, you take your loss. You don&amp;rsquo;t leave early because it makes you feel sad inside. Your opponent deserves more respect than that.

Authorities say double murder suspect Cesar Armando Laurean was spotted heading through Louisiana toward Texas. Police are less than 2 hours behind the suspect. From FoxNews.com:
 Marine Cpl. Cesar Armando Laurean was seen getting on or off a Greyhound bus in Shreveport, La., Saturday night, said Shreveport police Chief Henry Whitehorn Sr.
 &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re working with the U.S. Marshal&amp;rsquo;s Service and other law enforcement agencies trying to locate him,&amp;rdquo; Whitehorn told The Associated Press.

  Officer Norvelle Brown, only 22 years old and a rookie cop, made St. Louis headlines for the second time in his short career&amp;ndash;his short, honorable life. In April, Officer Brown responded to a hostage situation during a barber shop robber, defusing the situation and apprehending the armed robbers.
