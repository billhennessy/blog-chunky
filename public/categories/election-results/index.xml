      <description>Obama Intelligence Pick Torpedoed By Bloggers - FOXNews.com Transition Tracker
 John Brennan, Obama&amp;rsquo;s chief intelligence adviser and anticipated CIA chief, was recently forced to withdraw his name. There was no drumbeat of opposition to Brennan from the front pages or on cable. Rather, the pick was torpedoed by the blogosphere.
 &amp;ldquo;Apparently there is a lot of pressure on the Obama team from a blog saying that Brennan couldn&amp;rsquo;t be made the director of the CIA because he was involved in torture and renditions, which he wasn&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; said Mark Lowenthal, former assistant CIA director.</description>

      <description>It turns out, according to a Zogby poll to be released in its entirety today, that most Obama voters are woefully, frighteningly, and unforgivably ignorant of the basic facts of government and of Barack Obama himself. Not surprising. Dickens warned us of the dangers of ignorance in &amp;ldquo;A Christmas Carol&amp;quot;:
 Suddenly, Scrooge noticed something strange about the ghost. Two children-like figures were at the ghost&amp;rsquo;s feet - a boy and a girl.</description>

      <description>Holy crap! That was the best speech McCain ever delivered. It was heartfelt and powerful. It was moving. It was . . . remarkable.
And it reminded me of a great reason to celebrate. Let me explain.
I was born in 1963 when there were still &amp;ldquo;Colored&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;White&amp;rdquo; drinking fountains. Obama&amp;rsquo;s a few years older.
Tonight, despite my best efforts and many others, we have a black President. That&amp;rsquo;s amazing in a very good way.</description>

      <description>At 8:18 p.m. CST, democracy in America ended. The people have spoken. We are now a socialist country.
Good night, comrades.
The 2nd American Revolution begins tomorrow.

      <description>Fox New just called Ohio for Obama, meaning McCain is mathematically eliminated. UPDATE: Looks like Obama has won Florida. Michigan and Minnesota have gone communist, joining Wisconsin.
UPDATE: Why is Major Garrett interviewing Adolf Hitler?
UPDATE 8:05: Senate Calls (that matter) John Barrasso (R) wins special election in Wyoming; Mike Enzi (R) wins re-election; Republican Pat Robert wins re-election in Kansas; Tim Johnson (D) wins re-election in SD; Dems pick up Pete Dominici&amp;rsquo;s Senate seat in New Mexico (Dems +4); Jeff Session retains his seat, as does Thad Cochran (both Republicans); the special election for Senate in Mississippi too close to call, but the Republican leads.</description>
