      <description>The thing that most rankled the left and crony-capitalist &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; about Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s Magic Escalator Ride were his statements on illegal immigration. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re not sending their best.&amp;rdquo;
The left sees open borders as a means of finally reducing the United States to a pauper nation, a dream long shared by socialists and communists in the US and Europe.
Crony capitalists are less prosaic in their aims. They see open borders as a source of cheap labor.</description>

      <description>Scott Adams says Donald Trump lives his life like a movie or television series. (See Looking Ahead to Season Four of Trump for a complete explanation.) Being New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve, it&amp;rsquo;s time to look back on Season Five (2019) and, then, look ahead to season six (2020) of Trump.
Season Five: Mueller Report and Ukraine Hoax Going into 2019, the Fed had slowed the incredible Trump Economy with aggressive interest rate hikes.</description>

      <title>What Do Democrats Expect?</title>

      <description>If Democrats cross the Rubicon by impeaching President Trump, they will be sending a strong signal: no Republican president will ever survive his first term.
How do you expect people to respond? I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the people President Obama derisively labeled &amp;ldquo;bitter clingers.&amp;rdquo;
  The people RealPolitics data analyst Sean Trende identified as &amp;ldquo;downscale, Northern, rural &amp;hellip; H. Ross Perot voters.&amp;rdquo;
Or, to put it another way, Tea Partiers.</description>

      <title>The Mueller Prophecy</title>
      <link>https://hennessysview.com/post/2019/the-mueller-prophecy/</link>

      <description>Friends,
Let me begin by saying &amp;ldquo;I am sorry&amp;rdquo; to Robert Mueller and his family.
I have been critical of Mr. Mueller and his sham &amp;ldquo;investigation.&amp;rdquo; I have been uncharitable to him. And I am sorry.
It became clear today that Mr. Mueller wasn&amp;rsquo;t a hostile actor. Obviously, Mueller is seriously impaired. What we saw in his selection of lawyers, in his handling of the investigation, in his management of partisan and criminal conduct by senior Justice Department officials under his command resulted not from malice toward the president but from incompetence.</description>

      <description>For a few weeks in June and July, Nancy Pelosi was doing a good job of isolating the Hate Squad. Pelosi realizes that the Hate Squad is bad for Democrats. She saw the Hate Squad growing in media attention, and she worked hard to stop that trend.
Then, like a genius, Donald Trump did what Trump does best: he stuck out his chin to let his opponent (Pelosi) punch herself out.</description>
