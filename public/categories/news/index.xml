      <description>Remember this?
   I&amp;rsquo;m sure you have some cosmic rationale
But here you are with your faith
And your Peter Pan advice
You have no scars on your face
And you cannot handle pressure
The pressure
Pressure
1, 2, 3, 4 Pressure!

      <description>Scott Faughn&amp;rsquo;s name came up in conversation last week.
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s this Faughn guy&amp;rsquo;s role in the Greitens&amp;rsquo; investigation?&amp;rdquo; someone asked.
Faughn is the publisher of Missouri Times and a former mayor of Poplar Bluff, Missouri. Papers call him a &amp;ldquo;power broker.&amp;rdquo; Others call him the &amp;ldquo;Candy Man.&amp;rdquo;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the question. &amp;ldquo;Not sure,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;His paper hates Grietens, but that&amp;rsquo;s as much as know. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been to his weird, hidden party pad in Jefferson City.</description>

      <title>Party Thursday!</title>

      <description>A great State Rep decides to give up his seat. The seat previously held by the Speaker of the House and a conservative legend. A seat in, perhaps, the most reliably conservative House district in St. Louis County.
Now, there&amp;rsquo;s a battle for that seat. A battle between a left-leaning Establishment Republican and a grassroots Conservative activist. An activist whose work for the right causes earned a star on Heritage Action&amp;rsquo;s Wall of Honor.</description>

      <title>Doc of the Decade Is Almost Here. Watch the Trailer</title>

      <description>This is the most important documentary of the decade.
https://youtu.be/X_AyP9SAEJc  What can you do? Start close to home.
Don&amp;rsquo;t tolerate intolerance. Don&amp;rsquo;t curb your tongue. And don&amp;rsquo;t elect whimps to government. Missouri&amp;rsquo;s legislature needs every person with spine it find.
You don&amp;rsquo;t want a mouse in the House.
And Dottie Bailey has no places for safe spaces.
If you live in Wildwood, Eureka, or Pacific areas, vote for Dottie Bailey.</description>

      <title>How Senator Schaff&#39;s &#34;Clean Missouri&#34; Plan Will Deliver the Legislature to Democrats</title>

      <description>People who spend a lot of time in Jefferson City say Rob Schaff is so consumed with Governor Greitens that he&amp;rsquo;s completely lost his marbles. (I don&amp;rsquo;t know. Just telling you what I hear.)
When I read about Schaff&amp;rsquo;s latest endorxement of the Clean Missouri petition initiative, I believed the stories. This is dangerous stuff. If Clean Missouri becomes law, State Senator Rob Schaff&amp;rsquo;s proposal would flip our state legislature from Republican Red to a deep and dirty Democrat Blue.</description>
