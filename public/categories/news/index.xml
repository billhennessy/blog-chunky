      <description>Remember this?
   I&amp;rsquo;m sure you have some cosmic rationale
But here you are with your faith
And your Peter Pan advice
You have no scars on your face
And you cannot handle pressure
The pressure
Pressure
1, 2, 3, 4 Pressure!

      <description>Scott Faughn&amp;rsquo;s name came up in conversation last week.
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s this Faughn guy&amp;rsquo;s role in the Greitens&amp;rsquo; investigation?&amp;rdquo; someone asked.
Faughn is the publisher of Missouri Times and a former mayor of Poplar Bluff, Missouri. Papers call him a &amp;ldquo;power broker.&amp;rdquo; Others call him the &amp;ldquo;Candy Man.&amp;rdquo;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the question. &amp;ldquo;Not sure,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;His paper hates Grietens, but that&amp;rsquo;s as much as know. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been to his weird, hidden party pad in Jefferson City.</description>

      <description>A great State Rep decides to give up his seat. The seat previously held by the Speaker of the House and a conservative legend. A seat in, perhaps, the most reliably conservative House district in St. Louis County.
Now, there&amp;rsquo;s a battle for that seat. A battle between a left-leaning Establishment Republican and a grassroots Conservative activist. An activist whose work for the right causes earned a star on Heritage Action&amp;rsquo;s Wall of Honor.</description>

      <description>This is the most important documentary of the decade.
https://youtu.be/X_AyP9SAEJc  What can you do? Start close to home.
Don&amp;rsquo;t tolerate intolerance. Don&amp;rsquo;t curb your tongue. And don&amp;rsquo;t elect whimps to government. Missouri&amp;rsquo;s legislature needs every person with spine it find.
You don&amp;rsquo;t want a mouse in the House.
And Dottie Bailey has no places for safe spaces.

      <title>How Senator Schaff&#39;s &#34;Clean Missouri&#34; Plan Will Deliver the Legislature to Democrats</title>

      <description>People who spend a lot of time in Jefferson City say Rob Schaff is so consumed with Governor Greitens that he&amp;rsquo;s completely lost his marbles. (I don&amp;rsquo;t know. Just telling you what I hear.)
When I read about Schaff&amp;rsquo;s latest endorxement of the Clean Missouri petition initiative, I believed the stories. This is dangerous stuff. If Clean Missouri becomes law, State Senator Rob Schaff&amp;rsquo;s proposal would flip our state legislature from Republican Red to a deep and dirty Democrat Blue.</description>

      <description>I gave up news for Lent.  I also stayed away from blogging. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to have fewer opinions about fewer things. When you have a lot of opinions about a lot of things, nothing is more important than anything else. But that&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous. Some things are more important than others. Some questions must be answered before others.  So I gave up news for Lent, and I might never go back.</description>

      <description>Nothing has shaken my support for Eric Greitens.
People ask me if I&amp;rsquo;m sorry I supported him. Are you kidding?
Governor Greitens signed Right to Work. Something I&amp;rsquo;ve supported since it first appeared in the 1970s.
Governor Greitens strengthened Missouri&amp;rsquo;s strong Right to Life policies.
Governor Greitens is rebuilding Missouri jobs and wages.
Governor Greitens is doing exactly what we elected him to do for Missouri.
Is he perfect? Of course not.</description>

      <description>Scott Adams first identified Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s greatest strength. What do you think that might be?
It&amp;rsquo;s not his money or his business experience. Those are strengths, sure, but they&amp;rsquo;re not THE strength.
Scott Adams believes Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign was a movie script. Here&amp;rsquo;s what Adams wrote way, way back when Trump&amp;rsquo;s candidacy was still just a PR stunt because he had zero chance of winning even a single primary:
 A movie script is almost always arranged in what the professionals call a three-act form.</description>

      <description>Regardless of its ideology, that new leadership will assert public authority and demand private sacrifice. Where leaders had once been inclined to alleviate societal pressures, they will now aggravate them to command the nation&amp;rsquo;s attention.

Donald Trump can&amp;rsquo;t stand festering problems. Trump forces problems to the surface, into the daylight, where they can be fought and settled.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering how things will change in 2018, you might think back the mid-1980s.
In the 1980s, leftist professors, leftist news media, and leftist entertainers were angry. For years, they&amp;rsquo;d preached that Ronald Reagan was a neo-Nazi buffoon whose incompetence and malice would destroy America. Maybe even wipe out the human species. &amp;ldquo;I believe Ronald Reagan can turn America back into what it once was,&amp;rdquo; said comedian Steve Martin on Saturday Night Live in 1980, &amp;ldquo;a vast wasteland covered with ice.</description>

      <title>4 Years Ago Today, I Predicted de Blasio Would Ruin New York City</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m scheduling this blog on December 26, 2013. I&amp;rsquo;m predicting Bill de Blasio will be as bad for New York City as Mayor John Lindsay (1967-1974).
Read the original blog here.
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s look back at the New York City de Blasio inherited. According to ZeroHedge blog:
  New York crime rates are at historic lows, the $72.7 billion budget is balanced, jobs are at an all-time high and a record 54 million tourists pumped money into the economy this year.</description>

      <title>Liberals Are Not the Enemy</title>

      <guid>https://hennessysview.com/2017/10/01/liberals-are-not-the-enemy/</guid>
      <description>Forgive me. I say &amp;ldquo;liberal&amp;rdquo; sometimes when I mean something else.
My mistake is habit, not irony. (Irony would require some intent on my part.)
I grew up disparaging liberalism. I grew up reading and watching William F. Buckley Jr., for whom liberalism was the enemy.
In the post-WWII era, the liberalism of the day was a problem. But it was never the problem.
The problem in Western Civilization was a faction that used liberalism as cover.</description>

      <title>Trump Instigates NFL Labor Dispute</title>

      <guid>https://hennessysview.com/2017/09/28/trump-initiates-nfl-labor-dispute/</guid>
      <description>Yesterday, I predicted the NFL would suffer a season-shortening labor dispute this season or next.
The reason: President Trump&amp;rsquo;s pressure on owners to crack down on anthem haters will stir up a fight between NFL Players Association and the owners.
As if on cue:
[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_24766&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;1285&amp;rdquo;]Fox News[/caption]
 President Trump, in an exclusive interview with &amp;ldquo;Fox &amp;amp; Friends,&amp;rdquo; said that NFL owners are “afraid” to act against their players protesting the national anthem at games across the country.</description>

      <description>Blowout. Embarrassment. Lopsided. Laugher.
Humiliation.
Fans are doing to the NFL what Ray Rice did to his girlfriend in that elevator.

Bars are banning football.
The VFW has condemned the NFL. 
Fans are burning jerseys.
American Sniper&amp;rsquo;s widow livid.
Viewership is down 11% year-over-year.
Fans boo players they recognize.
Baltimore fans demanding Ray Lewis statue come down like he&amp;rsquo;s General Lee.
Major NFL sponsors are under increasing pressure to pull ads.</description>

      <title>President Trump Popped the NFL&#39;s Biggest Zit</title>

      <description>Coming to a head.
President Trump seems pathologically opposed to festering problems. When he sees a festering problem, he pops it like a zit. For example, the North Korean nukes problem has festered since the Clinton administration. Trump is bringing Little Rocket Man to a head.
NAFTA has been festering since the Clinton administration. Trump is bringing NAFTA to a head.
The latest example: the NFL anthem-haters.
This anthem-hating is over a year old.</description>

      <description>By now you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the photo. The iconic photo. One lone Army Ranger veteran defying his team to salute the flag during the Star-Spangled Banner.
[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_media-17&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;1200&amp;rdquo;]screenshot CBS[/caption]
You know that Alejandro Villanueva&amp;rsquo;s jersey and t-shirt immediately became the best-selling merchandise from the NFL&amp;rsquo;s store.
Villanueva served three tours of combat duty as an Army Ranger. He&amp;rsquo;s authorized to wear the Bronze Star. He stood for his country. In Afghanistan with the Army and in Pittsburgh alone.</description>

      <description>Brain damage. They all have brain damage. And they&amp;rsquo;ll likely die from it. Like Aaron Hernandez.
99 out of every 100 football players have serious brain damage.
Kneeling for CTE NFL players and owners decided to show their disrespect to the flag, law enforcement, and the USA by kneeling during the national anthem. In a foreign country.
The president responded by saying the NFL (and the TV networks) would be in big trouble if people stopped watching or attending games.</description>

      <description>You might not know about Franco Harris. You might wonder why he&amp;rsquo;s so unhappy, like many of us are, with the NFL&amp;rsquo;s anti-American antics lately. But his wonderful heritage tells a lot about why my favorite running back respects America.
His dad was an Army soldier. His dad met his mom in Italy during World War II. They married and returned to New Jersey.

      <description>You can see the battle brewing. It&amp;rsquo;s coming to a head. And no one is telling you the real reason the NFL is dying before your eyes.
Everyone sees the symptoms of football&amp;rsquo;s death spiral: empty stadiums. Crashed ratings. low quality. Criminals on the field. Some people call it &amp;ldquo;the National Felony League.&amp;rdquo;
Frustrated fans look for better entertainment. Ticket sales remain high for one reason: stupid corporate executives. Stupid executives think it&amp;rsquo;s still a status symbol to control lots of NFL tickets.</description>

Those United Nations stuffed shirts were dumbfounded. Struck dumb. Silenced. Shocked. Floored.
Those sissy diplomats were shaken. Appalled. Frightened.
Never in the sordid history of the United Nations has an American president spoken in unvarnished truth in unvarnished terms.
Trump has the best words.
Trump used his best words today.
The best of the best.
Trump called Kim Jung Un &amp;ldquo;Rocket Man.&amp;rdquo; The funniest and most effective linguistic kill-shot to date.</description>

      <description>Greg Jarrett thinks Jeff Sessions should resign. I do, too.
I felt like the lone voice on the right last week when I wrote &amp;ldquo;Counseling Sessions.&amp;rdquo; It feels great to have Greg Jarrett agree: Jeff Sessions should resign.
As Jarrett puts it:
 Sessions appears either incapable or incompetent. He has resisted producing the documents relevant to the anti-Trump dossier which were subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee. He has failed to appoint a special counsel to reopen the case against Hillary Clinton for likely violations of the Espionage Act in the use of her email server, obstruction of justice for destroying 33,000 emails under congressional subpoena, and potential self-dealing for profit through her foundation.</description>

      <description>James Clapper lied to Chuck Todd.
Clapper wiretapped Paul Manafort and lied about it. Just like Trump said.
James Clapper looks like a kind old grandfather. Like Josef Stalin. Or an elderly Charles Manson.
Like Stalin and Manson, **Clapper&amp;rsquo;s soiled name deserves to be flushed into the bowels of history&amp;rsquo;s bio hazard tank. **
James Clapper categorically denied that anyone associated with the Trump campaign was ever wiretapped. He lied.</description>

      <description>You will be mad.
You probably don&amp;rsquo;t have a contract with Equifax. Your creditors do.
When you apply for a loan, you give creditors permission to:
*1. Obtain your credit file. *2. Update your credit file.
You expect that creditors vet their vendors, don&amp;rsquo;t you? You assume banks and credit card companies test their vendors&amp;rsquo; security.
And you expect financial services companies like Equifax to be on the up and up.</description>

      <description>CAUTION: This report comes from very fake news blog CNN and may fall apart over the next 24 to 48 hours (like most of CNN&amp;rsquo;s fake reports fall apart).
CNN is reporting that Special Investigator Robert Mueller leaked secret documents to the press indicating the Obama White House &amp;ldquo;wiretapped&amp;rdquo; Paul Manafort before and after last year&amp;rsquo;s election.
CNN previously mocked and scorned President Trump for suggesting Obama wiretapped Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign. CNN says Mueller&amp;rsquo;s office cautioned that conclusions about Russian connection were &amp;ldquo;inconclusive.</description>

      <description>You can almost see it in your mind if you try. The cartons of Chinese takeout. The torn blisters of soy sauce. Nancy Pelosi, former swimsuit model, laughing at The Donald&amp;rsquo;s off-color jokes. About Mitch McConnell. Or Paul Ryan. While Chuck fills color of his own, about deals he helped The Donald put together back in New York. Stuff that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it into The Art of the Deal or The Art of the Comeback.</description>

      <description>Not often does a person or an event fit every definition of a single word. But Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s life after the election fits perfectly all three definitions of graceless.
__
Graceless.
Graceless Hillary.
Why didn&amp;rsquo;t Donald Trump think of that one during the campaign. &amp;ldquo;Graceless Hillary…&amp;rdquo;
Not a single rational being could challenge the accuracy of that monicker. Graceless Hillary.
Clumsy.
No sense of propriety or decency.
Inferior or clumsy in treatment or performance.</description>

      <description>Eight months into the Trump Administration, one cabinet appointment stands out as a flop: Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
 We all had a lot of hope. Back in January. Hope.
Hope for the Trump administration. Hope for American greatness. And hope for justice. If you&amp;rsquo;re a Tea Partier, you had a lot of hope.
Jeff Sessions looked like the ultimate pick for Attorney General. Conservatives berated Mitch McConnell to accelerate Sessions&amp;rsquo; confirmation by the Senate.</description>

      <description>Move Over, Enron: Equifax Is Next  The worst problem of modernity lies in the malignant transfer of fragility and antifragility from one party to the other, with one getting the benefits, the other one (unwittingly) getting the harm, with such transfer facilitated by the growing wedge between the ethical and the legal. This state of affairs has existed before, but is acute today— modernity hides it especially well.

      <description>By now you&amp;rsquo;ve heard that President Trump struck a deal with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. Trump struck a deal to raise the debt ceiling. Trump struck a deal by going around Congressional Republicans. Trump struck a deal with Democrats.
It&amp;rsquo;s about time, frankly. But Trump can go a lot further on this path. If I were his chief strategist, I&amp;rsquo;d tell him to go further. How far? Keep reading.</description>

      <description>Many people say, &amp;ldquo;you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t punish children for sins of the parent.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s something we firmly believe as Americans. The US Constitution even prohibits &amp;ldquo;corruption of blood.&amp;rdquo; Corruption of blood refers to laws that pass guilt genetically from generation to generation.
I think we can all agree that punishing children for their parents&amp;rsquo; crimes is un-American. But what about children who profit from their parents&amp;rsquo; crimes? Should they be allowed to keep the booty?</description>

No electricity.
No cell phone or land line.
No radio.
No electric tooth brush.
No internet or cable.
No laptop. No tablet.
Car: nothing.
What happened?
No, it&amp;rsquo;s not a scene from the Twilight Zone. It&amp;rsquo;s the aftermath of an electromagnetic pulse attack. EMP for short.
An EMP attack would look like this:
** North Korea launches an ICBM toward North America ** The warhead detonates 100 miles above Colorado ** Waves of electromagnetic energy pulse down across the fruited plain ** Every semiconductor and small wire in the United States burns out</description>

      <description>It might happen before I finish typing this post.
Maybe it already happened. Maybe we just haven&amp;rsquo;t heard.
Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a few days away.
But it&amp;rsquo;s coming, folks. Believe me, it&amp;rsquo;s coming. And it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a doozy.
So many lefties were hoping that Hurricane Harvey would finally knock out President Trump. If they pray, they prayed. They prayed for a monumental catastrophe. They prayed for total collapse of FEMA.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened.
Someone posted this photo on twitter. All the sane people laughed.
@realDonaldTrump retweeted. And now it&amp;rsquo;s the left&amp;rsquo;s new Russian conspiracy.
I remember when all the best comedians were liberals. But the new left traded its sense of humor for baseball bats with ten penny nails.
USA!
Meanwhile, the pre-schoolers at CNN have their panties in a bunch because the President of the United States wore a hat emblazoned with USA.</description>

 Dear People of Houston (and thereabouts),
President Trump has said, &amp;ldquo;the whole world is watching.&amp;rdquo; And he&amp;rsquo;s right!
When people say &amp;ldquo;the whole world is watching,&amp;rdquo; they usually mean it as a warning.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been saying &amp;ldquo;America is back&amp;rdquo; ever since President Trump&amp;rsquo;s beautiful inauguration in January. And we meant it.
But &amp;ldquo;America is back&amp;rdquo; rose to a higher level today. A level not since the days following 9-11. Or maybe the greatest moments of the Reagan administration.
Today, in Houston, we saw the America of our dreams. The America that makes us cry when we hear the national anthem. Or when we see a soldier in Iraq bending down to help a tiny Iraqi child.</description>

      <description>When I watch President Trump in Texas, I am reminded of one of my favorite books.
Arthur C. Brooks wrote in The Conservative Heart:
 There is a common misconception that conservatives are materialistic. We are not, and this confusion is a central political irony of our time. Progressives truly want to help the poor but have tried to solve poverty primarily with government money, relegating talk of culture to the past and focusing more and more on income inequality.</description>

      <description>James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton three months before he interviewed her.
James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton before interviewing 16 key witnesses.
James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton before he gathered any significant evidence.
James Comey gave Hillary Clinton permission to destroy evidence in a felony investigation.
James Comey leaked classified information to the media.
These are all facts. No one disputes them.
They are all crimes of various degrees. Some felonies.</description>

      <description>It was probably a coincidence.
One day after Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View reported Speaker Paul &amp;ldquo;Dumbbell&amp;rdquo; Ryan as a member of the Antifa caliphate support team, Speaker Ryan&amp;rsquo;s office renounced his membership in the terrorist group&amp;rsquo;s fan club.

As reported by The Gateway Pundit:
 Social media was set ablaze after Paul Ryan attacked President Trump for condemning ‘both sides’ for the violence in Charlottesville. Trump supporters hammered Paul Ryan for refusing to condemn Antifa.</description>

      <description>If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal, we can flee from him.
    If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.</description>

      <description>You know this blog rarely criticizes President Trump. There&amp;rsquo;s a simple reason for that. That reason is the thousands of fraudulent journalists who create and repeat lies about President Trump every day. Like Jake &amp;ldquo;The Fake&amp;rdquo; Tapper. Those fake journalists don&amp;rsquo;t need my help.
You also know that I have criticized President Bush, Republican candidates for president, and many, many other Republicans and conservatives. I just adopted a simple rule last year: until the fake news media treats President Trump honestly and fairly, I won&amp;rsquo;t criticize my president.</description>

      <description>You probably believe the narrative. Because that narrative is strong right now. It has become common knowledge. Common knowledge in the formal, game theory sense of the word.
In game theory, common knowledge is something everyone knows everyone knows. And everyone know everyone knows. And everyone knows how everyone else will behave because of that knowledge.
Common knowledge doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be true. In a common knowledge game, truth doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.</description>

One consequence that we&amp;rsquo;ve all experienced: when you elect a street fighter, you get street fights.
Another consequence that terrorists are experiencing: when you elect a street-fighter patriot, terrorists die.
President Trump tonight reminded so many of us why we elected him. Because he&amp;rsquo;s a street fighter. Because he&amp;rsquo;s a patriot. Because there are bad people who wish us harm, and Donald Trump is okay with killing them.</description>

      <description>CNN screwed up. And it reminds me of an incident from 1970.
A headline writer admitted that the Antifa terror group seeks &amp;ldquo;peace through violence.&amp;rdquo; Later, presumably after receiving threats from Antifa terrorists, CNN removed the &amp;ldquo;peace through violence&amp;rdquo; sub-head.
But the damage was done. CNN stumbled onto real news. Real news that exposes Antifa&amp;rsquo;s terrorist aims.
Before we get to the dangers of normalizing political violence, aka &amp;ldquo;terrorism,&amp;rdquo; let&amp;rsquo;s remember a famous party.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s easy to say, &amp;ldquo;I hate racists and Nazis. I&amp;rsquo;m glad somebody&amp;rsquo;s taking the initiative and beating them with clubs.&amp;rdquo;
Many people feel that way. Many people feel it&amp;rsquo;s good and just to beat and maim wicked people. Especially people who hold wicked beliefs.</description>

      <description>Worry about your character, not your reputation. Reputation is what people think of you. Character is who you are.
 —John Wooden, legendary coach of basketball and character
Everyone admits that President Trump cares more about his character than about his reputation. Only a man concerned with his character would tell the truth.
Reputation is what people think of you. Character is who you are.
The Stoics teach us that reputation is beyond our control.</description>

      <description>Charlottesville used to be a place. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s a thing.
On Friday, Charlottesville was a city in Virginia.
Today, Charlottesville is an event. A thing.
In our hyper-emotional world of 2017, we are told to explore our emotions. Then act upon those emotions. Like poorly trained animals. Like half-wits. Like narcissists and spoiled brats. Like lower primates.
Like the KKK and BLM and Antifa thugs who turned that place into a thing yesterday.</description>

      <description>Angry texts.
I got a bunch of very angry texts this morning.
My friends are fired up. Because of Governor Greitens&amp;rsquo;s executive order. **An executive order that implements a novel approach to prescription drug databases. **
In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, Governor Greitens signed an executive order on July 17. The EO made Missouri the 50th state to establish some sort of prescription drug tracking.
Most states track everything about prescriptions.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Will Trump survive this?&amp;rdquo;
A friend of mine texted me yesterday. I had no idea what the &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; was. Later, I learned.
Turns out, like most of the media&amp;rsquo;s breathless revelations about Trump&amp;rsquo;s supposed crimes, the story that people reacted to meant little. The anti-Trump media exploded with fake news, fake interpretations of real news, and speculation that supported their own angry fetishes.
But any reasonable person would respond like my friend.</description>

      <description>You know it&amp;rsquo;s coming. Some fake news hack will claim the whole Foxconn-Wisconsin deal was a plot to find a new job for Reince Priebus.
Reince Priebus, the erstwhile White House chief of staff who prides himself on blocking deplorables from the White House posts they deserve, has been relieved of duties. He&amp;rsquo;s on his way back to native Wisconsin where Foxconn is building a $10 billion plant. Maybe Foxconn needs an establishment-connected middle manager.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll set the over-under on Priebus&amp;rsquo;s resignation/firing at 10 days (August 6).
Pick over or under in the comments.
Winners will get great satisfaction.
I&amp;rsquo;m taking under.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about, Gateway Pundit has it all. It&amp;rsquo;s juicy!
Just yesterday, Washington Times pointed out that the very swampy Priebus is increasingly isolated and lonely in the Trump White House. Nobody likes Reince.</description>

      <description>I campaigned for and voted for Donald Trump. I stand 100% behind Trump today.
I support Trump because he&amp;rsquo;s a fighter. He&amp;rsquo;s a man of action. Trump prosecutes his causes, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t navel gaze.
Jeff Sessions is a good man. He&amp;rsquo;s a good Washington man. He has standards of decorum. Standards I admire.
Trump has no standards of decorum. But I voted for Trump because history has made decorum a liability, even a vice.</description>

      <description>When Winston Churchill mouthed these eternal words, his nation&amp;rsquo;s life expectancy was about six months.
All of Western Civilization, all of Christiandom, seemed doomed.
One defiant man ended a speech to his House of Commons with this:
 I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone.</description>

      <description>People want cover. Danger drives us together.
It&amp;rsquo;s our nature. Our herding response gave our species an advantage. The herders lived to breed. The wanderers, the stragglers, fell prey. Genes of herders increased. Genes of loners receded.
But our strongest cover is our parents. They&amp;rsquo;re the protection we seek.
The pair of humans who brought us into the world provide the best cover. We are born helpless. Our parents sustain us.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Some things we can control, some we can’t. We can control our attitudes, opinions, goals and desires – choices of our own. We can’t control health, wealth, fame or power – things we can’t have by choosing them.&amp;rdquo; —Epictetus
 Freedom begins with understanding what we control and we do not. Yet very few people even begin to consider this essential dichotomy.
Even in the complete absence of &amp;ldquo;administration&amp;rdquo; as Tocqueville observed in early 19th century America, no one was free who failed to understand Epictetus&amp;rsquo;s control dichotomy: some things are under our control, some are not.</description>

They worry about this trend toward &amp;ldquo;unserious&amp;rdquo; politicians getting elected.
They worry about &amp;ldquo;what it says about voters&amp;rdquo; who elect Sarah Palin, Donald Trump, and (very soon) Kid Rock.
These serious Republicans long for the days of serious men and serious matters.

      <description>Kudos to Governor Greitens and the Missouri legislature. They killed a minimum wage law in St. Louis. The law was designed to make city politicians feel better about themselves. It&amp;rsquo;s certain result would have been fewer jobs for the people who need jobs the most.
Why are you complaining about Governor Greitens&amp;rsquo; first term? Did you not read his books?
Like Donald Trump, Eric Greitens called his plays at the line of scrimmage.</description>

 —Neil Howe and William Strauss, 13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?
I’ve written before that 2016 was the first Gen X Election. And that Donald Trump would be the first Gen X president. Not because he’s an Xer, but because he personifies our coming-of-age view of the world.</description>

Was it Comey&amp;rsquo;s admission that Trump was never under investigation?
Was it Kathy Griffin&amp;rsquo;s grim ISIS imitation?
Was it Trump&amp;rsquo;s 5-0 winning streak in special elections?
Like the ageless question of how many licks it takes to get to the Tootsie-Roll center of a Tootsie-Pop, the world may never know. Never know just when the Russian narrative broke.</description>

      <description>You are a target. They want you dead.
You are a conservative activist. They call themselves &amp;ldquo;progressives.&amp;rdquo;
You want to live. And you want to remain active in politics.
They want you dead. Or submissive. Like a slave. Or a battered woman.
No, you can&amp;rsquo;t attack them. You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t engage them. They&amp;rsquo;re rabid animals. Neither reason nor normal persuasion can change progressives from their deadly habits.
So what do you do?</description>

Cass Sunstein, a leftist who&amp;rsquo;s happy whenever a conservative dies early, wrote a book called Nudge. It&amp;rsquo;s a good psychology book. Nudge is about persuasion, which is my chief interest.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m smart enough to discount reviews from people who were recently fired from the company. I don&amp;rsquo;t ignore those reviews, but I discount the negative stuff. There&amp;rsquo;s a good chance that the disgruntled former employee is just venting. They feel wronged, even if they were terrible employees.</description>

CNN&amp;rsquo;s latest hate-crime: **CNN is criticizing London police for using too many bullets. **
That&amp;rsquo;s right. CNN will soon demand a UN war crimes tribunal to try, convict, and hang the London cops who put down the London Bridge terrorists.

 Because of tolerance, it’s getting harder and harder to make people laugh with Trump jokes. Everybody’s heard them all. So comedians have to ramp up the shock factor. And they have been. And it was working.
 Until Kathy Griffin went too far.
Comedians and leftist news people are bound to go too far. It&amp;rsquo;s bio-chemical response. And now, so many leftists are in a race to the top on excess and insanity.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to see in the fog of war, but comedienne Kathy Griffin did Donald Trump a huge favor. Before I explain, look at all the benefits Trump got from Griffin&amp;rsquo;s decapitation humor:
** Prominent Democrats and CNN turned against Hillary Clinton ** Andrea Mitchell and other journalists began admitting the Russian conspiracy theory is a hoax ** Americans sympathize with the Trump family ** Kathy Griffin&amp;rsquo;s crazy press conference made Trump look mature, sober, and sane by comparison</description>

      <description>Guest post by Lee A. Presser
For those of you who do not follow things as mundane as television rating scores, you may be surprised to learn that Fox News Channel (FNC) is losing its lead as the powerhouse in primetime cable TV ratings to MSNBC. There are a couple of reasons why.
First, control of FNC has been transferred to two brothers, Lachlan and James Murdoch, who do not believe in the political message espoused by Fox for the last twenty years.</description>

      <description>Congress is about to pass a budget. I call it a &amp;ldquo;Paul Ryan Special.&amp;rdquo; This budget lets the government spend money for four months. It expires in September.
The budget is horrible. Republicans are spinning a few &amp;ldquo;wins&amp;rdquo; in the budget, but that&amp;rsquo;s a terrible argument. It&amp;rsquo;s like telling a terminal cancer patient, &amp;ldquo;but your blood pressure&amp;rsquo;s pretty good.&amp;rdquo;

Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to beat the establishment to that punch a little. Because the Freedom Caucus and some of my favorite action organizations looked a little juvenile in this debate. Juvenile and stupid.</description>

      <description>President Trump is teaching the world a huge lesson. That valuable lesson goes something like this:
Don&amp;rsquo;t be needy.
Jim Camp is a world-famous negotiation coach. Jim has led some enormous negotiations: labor disputes, huge multi-national buys, and mergers. This is is what Jim says about neediness in his book Start With No:
 It is absolutely imperative that you as a negotiator understand the importance of this point. You do NOT need this deal, because** to be needy is to lose control and make bad decisions**.</description>

      <description>Paul Ryan unveiled a health care bill two weeks ago. Ryan&amp;rsquo;s favorite lobbyists wrote it. They wrote it in secret. They dumped it on the House GOP caucus.
A lot of my friends on the right went hermatile. &amp;ldquo;Shoved down our throats!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Obamacare two-point-oh!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Obamacare Lite!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Tyranny!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Entitlements!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Worse than Obamacare!&amp;rdquo; The most frequently used key on the keyboards of tea partiers was the exclamation point!
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get spun up over the way Speaker Ryan handled the bill.</description>

      <description>Almost every time Donald Trump says something crazy, something so outlandish and wrong, he later turns out to be right.
I know his critics can&amp;rsquo;t read my blog. (Literally, they can&amp;rsquo;t. They have a psychological problem that prevents their brains from processing information that&amp;rsquo;s inconsistent with their beliefs.) But for those of you who want to be right with the truth instead of just right with your own opinion, this will be a great post to forward to your friends.</description>

      <description>John McCain may have done some heroic things, but he is a hero no more.
Imagine how you&amp;rsquo;d feel.
A knock on your door.
Through the deadlights around your front door, you see a car with government stencils on the side. When you get close enough, you look out and see a man in uniform. An officer. You know. You know why he&amp;rsquo;s here. Your throat tightens. You want to turn around and walk away.</description>

In 2012, Barack Obama got caught telling Russian Prime Minister Medvedev that he&amp;rsquo;d have more &amp;ldquo;flexibility&amp;rdquo; after the election.
Later in 2012, during a debate, Obama accused GOP candidate Mitt Romney of stoking Cold War fears against our new friends in Moscow. Obama said, “The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because…the Cold War’s been over for 20 years!” In fact, in 2012, the whole pantheon of pantsuit partiersmocked warnings about Russia.</description>

In 1966, Hollywood liberals made a very funny movie. The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming! The movie mocked Cold Warriors and ridiculed hyper-paranoia about the dangers posed by Russia.
Some of those same Hollywood liberals are now running around screaming &amp;ldquo;The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Hate John McCain if you want. Call McCain a traitor, even.
I look at John McCain and marvel at his strength. Many do.
Everyone knows about McCain being shot down over Vietnam and spending 5 years in a POW camp. But most people don&amp;rsquo;t know about the deep emotional scar McCain brought home with him. And that emotional scar undoubtedly drives him to his fits of anger and telling lies about people he doesn&amp;rsquo;t like.</description>

      <description>Imagine Michael Jordan&amp;rsquo;s best game ever. Or Tiger Woods. That&amp;rsquo;s what it was like watching President Trump today. Amazing.
The President looked poised, cheerful, and humorous. He volleyed with Jim Acosta of CNN. He rated each question &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bad.&amp;rdquo; He explained why he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want a nuclear war with Russia because the press seems to think nuclear war is a good thing. He mocked those in the press who want him to bomb that Russian intel ship off Virginia.</description>

      <description>Soon thereafter, this great gate is sealed by the Crisis resolution, when victors are rewarded and enemies punished; when empires or nations are forged or destroyed; when treaties are signed and boundaries redrawn; and when peace is accepted, troops repatriated, and life begun anew. One large chapter of history ends, and another starts.
 In a very real sense, one society dies— and another is born.

      <description>The leftists who want you and me to die (at their hands?) call themselves The Resistance.
Okay. Let&amp;rsquo;s call them that.
Author Steven Pressfield wrote a book about defeating The Resistance. It&amp;rsquo;s called The War of Art, and it&amp;rsquo;s an awesome, wonderful book.
Overcoming and defeating The Resistance, Pressfield tells us, is the key to living the good life. I agree, even if I don&amp;rsquo;t agree on some of his enemies.</description>

      <description>You might have thought I was paranoid for wondering if some people in the CIA and the Deep State are plotting a coup to overturn our recent election.
The Wall Street Journal seems to agree with my conclusion: a coup attempt is going on in America. Rogue actors within the CIA, all of the major leftist media (New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS), and probably major defense contractors seem to be involved, though the Wall Street Journal stops short of accusing advertisers.</description>

      <description>Call me paranoid, but it seems Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s chances of taking the oath of office for President are diminishing every day.
You might find yourself wondering why the CIA would plot a coup against Trump and his supporters. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t wondered about a CIA coup, you should.** Focus your awareness for a moment on what Trump means to the people of the Deep State.**
The Deep State involves those people and institutions that have insulated themselves from the consequences of elections.</description>

      <description>Many powerful interests around the world loathe Donald Trump and the people who elected him. There&amp;rsquo;s no disputing that.
One of those powerful interests is the Central Intelligence Agency. One of the CIA&amp;rsquo;s own, Evan McMullin, attempted to disrupt the election. Like Bay of Pigs and Saddam&amp;rsquo;s weapons of mass destruction, that CIA plot failed. Even George Will admits the CIA makes some horrible, deadly mistakes. And sometimes those mistakes come from seeing the results they want to see, not the results presented.</description>

      <description>Kellogg sells mostly simple carbohydrates in the form of breakfast cereal and snacks. Their ad agencies make you think their foods are wholesome and safe. They&amp;rsquo;re not. They&amp;rsquo;re mostly simple carbohydrates (grains and sugar) that produce a glycemic shock when eaten. And foods that produce glycemic shock seem to be deadlier than cigarettes. At least that&amp;rsquo;s the suggestion from a recent study at the University of Texas.
The study of 2,000 lung cancer patients and 2,500 people without lung cancer should raise concern.</description>

Castro leaves behind a nation trapped in the 1950s.

      <description>Last week&amp;rsquo;s election demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the United States are still plural. Let me explain.
Language changes. Sometimes those changes alter what things mean. And because of the odd way the brain deals with language, some changes create constant confusion in our heads.
Once upon a time, &amp;ldquo;the United States of America&amp;rdquo; was a plural noun. (I&amp;rsquo;ll prove it to you in a moment.) Careful writers and speakers would say &amp;ldquo;the United States are .</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about policy, you&amp;rsquo;re thinking really, really small. Trump&amp;rsquo;s influence is way bigger. Here are three ways Trump will change America for a generation.

      <description>A few people have called me tonight to ask my prediction on the election. They know I&amp;rsquo;ve predicted a Trump landslide. They want to know if I stand by it.
My answer: blank slate.
I have no expectations. None. I have preferences, but no expectations.
It&amp;rsquo;s kind of silly to expect something you have little or no control over. I have no control over James Comey or Loretta Lynch, much less the millions of American and non-Americans who will vote.</description>

Remember August 2015? It was hot, of course, but everybody was talking about when Trump would fade. For example, here&amp;rsquo;s the RCP Afternoon Edition from August 7, the day after the first GOP debate:
 Whose Party Is It, Anyway? - Molly Ball, The Atlantic The Republican Debate Was Awesome - David Harsanyi, The Federalist You Cannot Embarrass Donald Trump - Ezra Klein, Vox The Beginning of the End for Trump - Ed Rogers, Washington Post Martin O&amp;rsquo;Malley, the Dems&amp;rsquo; Fallback?</description>

      <description>Since its revelation in WikiLeaks two weeks ago, Donna Brazile has been justly excoriated for cheating on behalf of Hillary Clinton by passing along a debate question.
However, an important aspect to this story has been overlooked. As the saying goes, it takes two to tango. Yes, Donna Brazile sent a critically beneficial piece of information - but Hillary Clinton accepted it.
Mrs. Clinton accepted it (stealing), used it (cheating), and said nothing (lying).</description>

      <description>Your life is in danger. At this moment, a Chinese nuclear warhead sits in a missile silo. Its guidance, if launched, instructs the warhead to detonate a mile or two above your home. And this was all made possible by extortion, murder, and illegal campaign contributions to Bill and Hillary Clinton.

      <description>You don&amp;rsquo;t need bombs and torpedos to destroy the Navy. Political correctness and terrible senior management are the Navy&amp;rsquo;s greatest threats. And today the Navy dropped a bomb on itself, with the help of Barack Obama.
Obama&amp;rsquo;s Secretary of the Navy eliminated the 241-year-old Navy enlisted rating system. Because Obama felt the ratings were too politically incorrect? They weren&amp;rsquo;t gender neutral. Via

   @whennessy i never made an issue of Trump&amp;rsquo;s use of the word bomb. so the whole premise of this is nonsense.

The controversy began when Hillary Clinton attacked Donald Trump for calling terrorist bombings in New Jersey and New York &amp;ldquo;bombs.&amp;rdquo; But in the same interview, Hillary called the bombings &amp;ldquo;bombing,&amp;rdquo; making her look like an idiot.</description>

As you watched Donald Trump destroy Hillary Clinton on NBC&amp;rsquo;s Commander in Chief forum, something big happened.
And you didn&amp;rsquo;t even know it.

      <description>UPDATE: The Gateway Pundit has confirmed Donald Trump will attend Phyllis Schlafly&amp;rsquo;s funeral in St. Louis.
If you&amp;rsquo;re glad Ronald Reagan was once President, you should thank Phyllis Schlafly.
Unfortunately, Mrs. Schlafly passed away, so you can&amp;rsquo;t thank her personally. But you can celebrate her life and her swift entrance to heaven.
**This Saturday at 2:00pm, the ones she left behind will gather at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis (New Cathedral), 4431 Lindell Blvd.</description>

Phyllis Schlafly, the conservative icon who roared to national prominence with her 1964 classic, A Choice, Not an Echo, passed away today, September 5, 2016. She was 92.
Eagle Forum, the pro-family, pro-American organization Phyllis launched in 1974, said in a statement:

So let&amp;rsquo;s just pretend it&amp;rsquo;s September 20, one week before the Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump appear at a joint press conference. (It&amp;rsquo;s not a debate. Hillary&amp;rsquo;s health won&amp;rsquo;t be up to a debate that soon.)
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s pretend that Trump&amp;rsquo;s outreach to Hispanics and blacks worked because Trump&amp;rsquo;s ahead in the polls.</description>

      <description>France’s population had changed considerably since 1614. The non-aristocratic members of the Third Estate now represented 98 percent of the people but could still be outvoted by the other two bodies. In the lead-up to the May 5 meeting, the Third Estate began to mobilize support for equal representation and the abolishment of the noble veto–in other words, they wanted voting by head and not by status. While all of the orders shared a common desire for fiscal and judicial reform as well as a more representative form of government, the nobles in particular were loath to give up the privileges they enjoyed under the traditional system.</description>

While serious problems fester, the media and politicians waste precious time and energy covering the massacres of police officers by black militants and the slaughter of Bastille Day revelers by Islamic terrorists.

      <description>Hillary, Obama, and much of the Democrat Party have fomented race hatred for years. They&amp;rsquo;ve ratcheted up their lies in recent months, hoping to turn race hatred into votes. They are that cynical and self-serving.
Now, Hillary and Obama have lost control of the fire they started. Crazed, racist murderers all across the country have declared war on police officers. From Dallas, Texas, to Ballwin, Missouri, to Baton Rouge, Louisianna, Hillary has sent a message that says it&amp;rsquo;s okay to kill a cop.</description>

When I was a freshman in college, a professor told me he saw George Will speak. He found Will&amp;rsquo;s conservatism &amp;ldquo;intellectual and reasonable,&amp;rdquo; unlike Ronald Regan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;extremism.&amp;rdquo; It was a shot at my Reaganism. I knew it.</description>

Cindy Schuenke was tending bar, and we started talking about the Rams&amp;rsquo; dismal season. She said they were hopeless, but I disagreed. &amp;ldquo;They are four players away,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;A quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a defensive end.&amp;rdquo;
Later in the year, but before the season, the Rams acquired Trent Green (and Kurt Warner) at QB, Marshall Faulk at RB, Adam Timmermann at offensive guard, and Grant Wistrom moved up to start at defensive end.</description>

You might even use them wrong. &amp;ldquo;There was a collusion on highway forty-four.&amp;rdquo; Or &amp;ldquo;I rigged my shorts.&amp;rdquo; (BTW, Hillary sounds weak and hoarse, doesn&amp;rsquo;t she? Grating.)

An angry screed by Kevin Williamson titled &amp;ldquo;Our Post-Literate Politics&amp;rdquo; (later renamed to &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s a Book?&amp;quot;) makes the case that Trump supporters are illiterate, uneducated, dim-witted, racist, homophobes.

Someone saw Elvis in Dallas eating lunch with Jim Morrison.
Conspiracy theories satisfy a psychological need to blame others for our problems or explain why the world doesn&amp;rsquo;t work the way we wish it worked.
Maybe two nuns in Peoria found a cure for cancer in 1954 and Big Pharma really did pay J. Edgar Hoover to seize the formula to keep the multi-billion dollar oncology pharmaceutical money-printer cranking out the bucks at full speed.</description>

      <description>When I was a kid (thought I felt kind of old at the time) disaster movies were the thing.
Before Star Wars, the 1970s were about killer sharks, towering infernos, earthquakes, and capsized cruise ships.
Psychologists and sociologists attributed the genre&amp;rsquo;s popularity to the people&amp;rsquo;s need to assimilate nuclear holocaust.
I think the movies were just good, cathartic entertainment.

      <description>I figured it out about the same time Ben Hochman of the Post Dispatch did: Stan Kroenke wrote a letter designed to force the owners to move the Rams to Los Angeles right now.
The acrimony created by Kroenke&amp;rsquo;s relocation request letter makes the situation in St. Louis untenable for the team and its owner. In short, Kroenke calls St. Louis a second-rate, economically depressed, crime-infest toilet of a city full of people so obsessed with baseball that no other sports franchise has the ability to compete for entertainment dollars.</description>

      <description>Last year about this time, Business Insider asked 13 Wall Street analysts where the S&amp;amp;P 500 would stand at close of trading today.
For background, the S&amp;amp;P 500 began the year at 2058.9. The mean guess for closing number was 2212 with a standard deviation of 83.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the ugly chart: Three of the guesses&amp;ndash;Oppenheimer, RBC, and Fundstrat&amp;ndash;were more than 3 standard deviations from the actual close of 2050.
Fundstrat&amp;rsquo;s Tom Lee, the most overzealous guesser, expected capex to drive the S&amp;amp;P 500 t0 a whopping 2325.</description>

      <description>Need to visit a federal building or military base after January 10? Your Missouri DL won&amp;rsquo;t work by itself.
If you have a Missouri drivers license or ID card but you do not have a passport or military ID, bring your Social Security card or your birth certificate.
That&amp;rsquo;s the word I got from Navy Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes.
The Department of Homeland Security informed Missouri last week that our state&amp;rsquo;s drivers licenses and ID cards will no longer serve as identification at federal agencies after January 10, 2016.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What was the biggest adjustment for you going from the military to the business world?&amp;rdquo;
Several people have asked me that question, and my answer always surprises them.
&amp;ldquo;In the military,&amp;rdquo; I say, &amp;ldquo;every individual has a lot more latitude and authority to act. In the business world, no one can do anything without explicit instructions.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Really? I thought it would be the other way around,&amp;rdquo; they say.
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s the popular culture, but the truth is one-hundred eighty degrees the other way.</description>

Take at look at this chart of generational voters in 2008 and 2012:

Where Did the Millennials Come From? Leaving biology out of it, it&amp;rsquo;s simple: 2016 will be the first election in which the entire Millennial cohort is old enough to vote. Plus Millennial-aged immigrants have increased their numbers.</description>

The more you know about anything, the less you like it. That’s a scientific fact.

We were talking about the Syrian refugees and Francis Slay’s insistence that hosting a lot of them is in the city’s vital interest.

But the St. Louis Post Dispatch has found that I may have been right on November 8.

I suspected that Planned Parenthood&amp;rsquo;s vast lobbyist network is agitating leaders of left-leaning organizations trying to create general unrest.

After the coordinated attacks by ISIS terrorists in Paris on Friday, expect the mayor come under intense pressure to change plans.

But I grew up in South St. Louis where we were just Irish. And the Italians were Italian and the Germans were German. (That&amp;rsquo;s about all we had in my neighborhood, plus a few Jewish converts to Catholicism, but they caucused with the Germans.)</description>

Welfare? In 1967 the poverty rate was 14 percent. In 2014, the poverty rate was 14 percent. In the interim, we pissed away $22 trillion on bureaucratic sex junkets to Costa Rica and massive government office buildings in every major city.</description>

      <description>What did Jefferson mean by “pursuit of happiness” as an unalienable right?
If you’ve heard it was a substitute for “property” because Jefferson feared Southerners would equate property with slaves, you heard wrong.
For weeks I have repeated a foundational belief of conservatism: every person deserves the dignity of meaningful work and the freedom to pursue happiness.
But what does it mean to pursue happiness? What did Jefferson mean? And why did Locke consider pursuit of happiness essential to liberty?</description>

      <description>Oh but now old friends they&amp;rsquo;re acting strange, They shake their heads, they say I&amp;rsquo;ve changed Well something&amp;rsquo;s lost, but something&amp;rsquo;s gained In living every day. &amp;ndash;Joni Mitchell, Both Sides Now
 I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at poor from both sides now.
I get a lot of grief for pushing poverty solutions. And service. Many conservatives believe Mitt Romney was right when he uttered his infamous 47 percent line.

      <description>Why is government involved in marriage at all? Taxes.
Brian Bollmann makes an excellent point about same-sex marriage.
Brian points out in this post that marriage is not a matter for government; contract law is. Government&amp;rsquo;s only concern in the case of a marriage is with its contractual implications:
 At some point in the short history of the United States (and certainly after the Civil War), state governments stepped onto the wall of separation and began getting involved in the religious institution of marriage in the appropriate area of protecting the rights to property – especially that of women.</description>

You know I have a day job. Sometimes that day job becomes a night job. And a weekend job, too.
That&amp;rsquo;s happened.
I&amp;rsquo;m still keeping up on what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the world, but travel and software launches and strategic plans have me spinning.
I like to write when I have a long periods of uninterrupted time. Well, those blocks of time have been few and far between.</description>

      <description>There seems to be a certain air of inevitability that Trump will win the GOP nomination for President. According to a new poll, 57 percent of Republican voters expect that Trump will be the party&amp;rsquo;s candidate next year. Why is that important?
Expectations Beat Preferences It&amp;rsquo;s important because expectations are far better predictors of actual winners than preference polls. From a 2012 NY Times story by David Leonhardt:
 Over the last 60 years, poll questions that asked people which candidate they expected to win have been a better guide to the outcome of the presidential race than questions asking people whom they planned to vote for, the study found.</description>

      <description>I was up early this morning sifting through the market stories.
** Asia: crash ** Middle East: crash ** Europe: crash ** USA: set to open
There&amp;rsquo;s good news in all this loss. First, stocks were overpriced. At some point, they will bottom out and it will be time to start buying. Second, the Golden Age of the Central Banker seems to be over. And that is very good news.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s sad that Donald Trump has inspired so many good conservatives to promote fantasies about the 14th Amendment.
The Supreme Court addressed the issue of birthright citizenship directly, and Mark Levin and Laura Ingram know it. They are Constitutional lawyers.
Both Levin and Ingraham are familiar with United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) which established, thoroughly, that citizenship by birth has been the law of the land since before the Declaration of Independence and was codified by the 14th Amendment.</description>

      <description>If you lack a unique, differentiating value, your only play is price.
In business, you command the price play by being very, very big and very, very efficient. In presidential politics, you&amp;rsquo;re unique or you close up shop and go home. Commodities don&amp;rsquo;t win executive offices. Usually.
Even though it&amp;rsquo;s early, only four Republican candidates for president have differentiating value propositions:
** Ben Carson ** Donald Trump ** Carly Fiorina ** Ted Cruz</description>

 While 26 percent of Americans report that they can’t live without their smartphone, only 20 percent of Americans say they can’t live without sex, according to this infographic compiled by FinancesOnline.com, a personal finance website.
 Seriously.

      <description>Did you hear about the ratings?
Over 24 million people watched the first Republican debate Thursday. That&amp;rsquo;s the largest audience ever for a cable program, save for sports.
Everybody knows why so many watched: people wanted to see a fight break out between Chris Christie and Rand Paul.
Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s presence probably didn&amp;rsquo;t hurt. Let me clarify that. Trump&amp;rsquo;s appearance helped rating. His performance might have ended his campaign.
Donald Trump comported himself with all the dignity and gravitas of a George W.</description>

I wanted to finish a great book called The Conservative Heart by Arthur C. Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute. The book left me feeling happy, proud, and inspired.
I should have gone to bed as soon as I finished the book. But the feeling of having read something wonderful wanted to linger, so I sat with it for a bit. Then I really screwed up.</description>

      <description>Conservatism blesses the world.
Our principles dignify people with work that** produces value**. We leave them **free to pursue happiness**, which includes their work, their leisure, their learning, and their families.
Our cause is moral and spiritual, not economic. We want everyone to experience and benefit from meaningful work because work provides people with self-esteem and satisfaction. Work is not punishment; it&amp;rsquo;s a blessing.
We do oppose things, but only those things that threaten to degrade human beings by denying them the dignity and benefits of working and living their own lives.</description>

      <description>Last week&amp;rsquo;s poll asked for your degree of support for Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s candidacy. This poll received far less attention than the Missouri GOP Governor poll of the previous week, as only 60 people responded.
On the plus side, there was no detectable cheating on the Trump poll.

      <description>In part 1 of this series, we clarified some misconceptions and falsehoods about the Franklin Project.
In part 2, we examined the debate on the right from 1990 with William F. Buckley and Milton Friedman.
Part 3 was a critique of the Franklin Project&amp;rsquo;s Plan of Action.
Today, we will look at the consequences should conservatives turn their backs on the concept of developing a service ethos in America.

      <description>This is part 2 of a series on national service and the Franklin Project. Read part 1 here.
First, answer this for yourself: would you vote for William F. Buckley Jr?
Milton Friedman on National Service My friend Lloyd Sloan points out that Milton Friedman disagreed with Buckley’s call for national service. It seems appropriate, then, to view the idea of a service ethos through the eyes of two champions of conservatism of the 20th century.</description>

      <description>Republican consultant David Barklage is in a weird place.
Barklage grew up in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, along with Peter Kinder. Barklage has been Kinder’s campaign consultant for years—all of Kinder’s races, as far as I know. They were a team. David Barlage was Peter Kinder’s chief of staff when Kinder was president pro tem of the Missouri Senate in 2002.
And a loyal consultant is a great tool for a politician.</description>

      <description>Down in my former state of South Carolina, the legislature hastily voted to remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol building. That is their prerogative, and I take no offense at their move.
What I do worry about is the haste.
South Carolina’s action on the flag reflected a spasm instigated by the horrible deeds of a horrible man—an unthinkable crime and grave sin. I can understand how the murderer’s association with the flag would lead people to connect the flag to the murders.</description>

Dottie Bailey: Cool!!
William Hennessy: We are in that phase of history. The 20th century is dying, or dead
Dottie Bailey: Makes me sad though.
William Hennessy: Everything that we called “normal” for all our lives lies listless in the beaks of sparrows—psychopomps—on their way to a new birth.

      <description>This post is about the control you have.
And the control you don’t have.
Last week was tough on a lot of us. The Supreme Court limited your freedom. The same-sex marriage case was very similar to Roe v. Wade in judicial legislation. States lost the power to regulate marriage. (There’s a deep theological discussion around whether the state ever had any say in marriage, but that’s for another post.)</description>

      <description>Limited government, fiscal responsibility, and the other tea party principles are not ends. They were never ends. Tea party principles are merely the most effective and efficient means to nobler ends
Those ends include a society and a nation that respects and protects life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Without life, of what use are the others?
Just as we speak out when &amp;ldquo;government becomes destructive of these ends,&amp;rdquo; so we must speak out when misguided and deranged individuals pervert those principles—or any principles—to their own illegitimate and murderous ends.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll make this brief.
If we must respect (revere?) the erstwhile Bruce Jenner for self-identifying as a woman, we have to respect Rachel Dolezal for self-identifying as black.
Both voluntarily left the world of privilege, as it were, to join an underclass&amp;ndash;an identifiable minority. Jenner left manhood; Dolezal left whitehood.
The left doesn&amp;rsquo;t see it that way, though. Apparently, rejecting one&amp;rsquo;s biological sex is okay, but rejecting one&amp;rsquo;s biological race isn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Without comment . . .
 Jefferson City, MO, May 29, 2015 - A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Senate Bill 672, passed by the Missouri General Assembly in 2014, was filed in Cole County circuit court on May 29th.
 The lawsuit claims that the General Assembly ignored the constitutional limits to their legislative authority. The Missouri Constitution includes clauses that prohibit legislators from changing the purpose of a bill, including multiple subjects in one bill, or passing a “special law” that fails to treat everyone equally.</description>

      <description>I know &amp;ldquo;House of Cards&amp;rdquo; character Frank Underwood is fictitious, malicious, and evil.
But even an evil fictitious character can hit the nail on its head occasionally.

We might not like his prescription, but he diagnoses America&amp;rsquo;s chief problem more concretely, more accurately, and more honestly than any American politician ever has. Ever.
 We’ve been crippled by Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, by welfare, by entitlements. And that is the root of the problem: entitlements.</description>

      <title>How to Recruit Better Political Candidates</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s accept that people are lazy.
I noticed no one rose to argue, so universal laziness is a given.
When political consultants and parties recruit candidates, they do the lazy thing. They look for candidates who are easily electable. They want people who look good, speak well, shake hands like they&amp;rsquo;re still alive, and never made the papers for slapping their spouse.
Actually, they want people who are squeaky clean. Boring.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What did you give up for Lent?&amp;rdquo;
Ever get that one? Like it&amp;rsquo;s something you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to post on your Facebook page.
A very good priest I knew, Dom Oppenheimer, warned against revealing one&amp;rsquo;s Lenten sacrifice.
&amp;ldquo;When you tell others what you gave up for Lent, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to feel some pride,&amp;rdquo; he explained. &amp;ldquo;But pride is the worst sin.&amp;rdquo;
That actually makes a lot of sense when you think about.</description>

Forget the Constitutional stuff. That&amp;rsquo;s important, but most people don&amp;rsquo;t care. Seriously. As soon as you mention the Constitution or mercantilism, the 99% walk away.
And the remaining 1% already agree with you.

      <description>The human brain is three times as sensitive to pain as it is to gain.
That’s a gross over-simplification, but it’s basically true. In other words, you’ll work three-times harder to save a dollar you have than to earn one you don’t.
Put another way, you won’t bet a dollar with even odds unless you stand to gain three dollars for a win.
That’s not a flaw. It keeps you alive.</description>

      <description>Hancock, who is a political consultant, said he held meetings last fall with prospective donors for a project to register Catholic voters. Hancock said that if he had mentioned that Schweich was Jewish, it would have been in the context that Hanaway was Catholic but that was no indication of how Catholics were likely to vote.
 Those circling the wagons around John Hancock: woe betide you. God forgive you.</description>

      <description>Excerpts from past posts on Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View about Tom Schweich
&amp;ldquo;Integrity&amp;rdquo; is the first word I think of when trying to describe Tom Schweich.
Rock n Roll Lunch We met for lunch on a hot day in April 2010. I expected a typical GOP establishment hack: smooth, overly friendly, defensive, and forgettable. I expected the man others told me to expect. But I met someone very different.
How different? That lunch ended listening to his band&amp;rsquo;s recording of their original rock song.</description>

      <description>News of Auditor Tom Schweich&amp;rsquo;s death hit me hard. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported to day that my friend Tom Schweich died of a gunshot wound today. Tom was 54.
I am saddened by this news. I pray for Tom&amp;rsquo;s family and for his rapid entry to eternal happiness.
May perpetual light shine on him, and may his soul and all the souls of all the faithful departed rest in peace.</description>

      <description>I was scared. Not afraid to say it.
And some friends turned hostile. They had good reasons. And I was probably a little cavalier. And I talked way too long.
But last September I wanted to start something that would help real people in our neighborhood while advancing liberty and upsetting abusive government. Sure, I&amp;rsquo;d rather upset the federal government in Washington, but my arms are little short to box with Harry Reid.</description>

      <description>If you think the mall protests are about the police, Ferguson, Mike Brown, or Darren Wilson, you could be wrong.
For some, Mike Brown is a pawn. The protests are mere opportunities to exploit.
 Travis Martin, a protester who was at the bowling alley and the Justice Center, said he didn&amp;rsquo;t think that activist leaders had done enough planning and promotion for an event at the Galleria.

A liberal friend on Twitter admonished me not to be political. Maybe he&amp;rsquo;s right.
But I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure Dellena&amp;rsquo;s 911 Beauty Salon burned in Ferguson tonight. It seems everything else has, too. The airport is closed. St. Louis&amp;rsquo;s image may be taking a fatal blow. The region might go the way of Gary, Indiana.</description>

People tell me Republican consultant John Hancock is a really nice guy.
I think they&amp;rsquo;re right. And, as Hancock&amp;rsquo;s clients have learned repeatedly, nice guys finish last.
The clearest example of Hancock&amp;rsquo;s failure was John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s campaign for US Senate in 2012.
Brunner is an exceptional businessman with a remarkably clear and accurate political philosophy. Had Brunner succeeded in winning the GOP nomination for Senate, Claire McCaskill would be retired, the GOP would have a Senate majority already, and Rand Paul would have a philosophical friend in the upper chamber.</description>

      <description>_Updated: the original title said &amp;ldquo;Congress is for sale.&amp;rdquo; My mistake. I meant Government. _
Once upon a time in America, people built companies by filling society&amp;rsquo;s unmet needs. To survive, a company relied on innovation, quality, and, of course, good advertising. The best advertisement being word of mouth.
That&amp;rsquo;s all changed now.
The way to grow a successful company is to get government to protect your market, dampen competition, and require people to buy what you sell.</description>

Yesterday, I wrote about Jesse Jackson dressing down at the hands of activists in a McDonald&amp;rsquo;s parking lot in Ferguson. I pointed out that Martin Luther King and Dick Gregory were similarly dismissed by rioters in the 1960s. Some things never change.
One thing that has changed is the economic gap between whites and blacks. That&amp;rsquo;s gotten worse despite trillions in federal poverty programs that went mostly to &amp;ldquo;community organizing.</description>

A few years ago, I shouted with my lungs at Tea Party events. I realized pretty quickly that shouting wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing any good. It worked at first. Shouting carried my voice to people who thought &amp;ldquo;no one believes what I believe.&amp;rdquo; Some people heard me yelling at the Arch and came out to see what the hell was going on.</description>

      <description>Is it possible that we do criminal trials backwards?
In the United States, criminal trials have two parts:
*1. Determination of guilt or innocence *2. Determination of penalty
Does that make sense?
What if we did it the other way around? What if, first, the prosecutor and defense attorney had to convince the judge or jury of the appropriate punishment for the crime in question. In this phase, the state would present the facts of the case.</description>

      <description>I wrote previously that I hate elections.
I have many reasons for hating elections. One reason, though, seems pretty common: horrible, insulting radio ads.
Two ads really stick out:
 The negative ad that mentions the sponsoring candidate&amp;rsquo;s opponent(s) five times as often as it mentions the candidate you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to remember at the poll. The couple having a stilted, phony conversation about the sponsoring candidate using words and interruptions that no human being ever uttered or ever will.</description>

      <description>You don&amp;rsquo;t hear the word &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; in political spin like you used to.
Back in the late 1980s when Jack Kemp, Pat Robertson, Pete DuPont, Al Haig, and George H. W. Bush were battling to replace
[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_15090&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;rdquo;] 1988 Republican Candidates[/caption]
Ronald Reagan, &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; was in. Candidates fought for the title of &amp;ldquo;mainstream Republican,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;mainstream Conservative,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;mainstream everything.&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;m glad that word went away. But I&amp;rsquo;m bringing it back, if only for one blog post.</description>

      <title>What Francis Slay Won&#39;t Tell You About Missouri Roads—VIDEO</title>

      <description>Proponents of Amendment 7 are telling a lot of lies. (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you, St. Louis Business Journal.) The biggest lie involves the quality of Missouri&amp;rsquo;s roads and bridges.
While Mayor Slay and the St. Louis Business Journal tell you Missouri&amp;rsquo;s roads are &amp;ldquo;crumbling,&amp;quot; two independent studies say the opposite. In fact, Missouri has some of the best roads in the country.
Via Show-Me Institute (h/tDarin Morley):
 We have often commented that Missouri is “middle of the pack” in various state rankings.</description>

Audio: President on deploying National Guard to alleviate humanitarian crisis: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to consider it,&amp;rdquo; but it would be &amp;ldquo;a temporary solution.&amp;rdquo;
Face it: the press was going to blame George Bush for Katrina no matter what.</description>

      <description>What political label do you give yourself?
Yesterday, I blogged about calling myself a Republican. I was a kid.
Then, from about 1996 on, I called myself a conservative.
Over the past year or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken on the label of libertarian. Now, a simple online test confirms that I&amp;rsquo;m a right-leaning conservative. [Take the test yourself]
That&amp;rsquo;s exciting, because I feel like I need a new label.
Labels Matter I know there was a movement a couple of years ago to abolish political and ideological labels.</description>

 Bond: You noticed.

You have to ask &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;
Why would national Republicans like Roy Blunt, Ann Wagner, Billy Long, and Jason Smith jump into a State Senate primary?
The race to replace Senator John Lamping in Missouri&amp;rsquo;s 24th State Senate district is attracting major attention from Missouri&amp;rsquo;s US Congress delegation.</description>

      <description>How many times have you thought, &amp;ldquo;I really don&amp;rsquo;t care for the Republican, but I&amp;rsquo;ll never vote for a Democrat?&amp;rdquo;
How does that thought make you feel? Weak or strong? Impotent or powerful? Eager or dispirited?
Do you know why you feel forced to choose between the lesser of two evils?
Because you want to.
In almost every race, you have more than two choices. In the 2014 US House elections in Missouri, ballots in all eight districts will have a Libertarian or independent candidate, or both.</description>

      <description>Not all casualties of war die in the field. Or even during hostilities.
We&amp;rsquo;ve learned that some of our warriors died because they landed on a &amp;ldquo;secret waiting list.&amp;rdquo;
Bureaucrats love pleasing their bosses. They live for it. In the case of the Veterans Administration, bureaucrats fired the final shot in the wars of at least 40 American warriors.
Sadly, the American government proved a deadlier foe than Hitler, Tito, Saddam, or bin Laden to some of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines.</description>

      <description>I told my nephew Scott that I was worried about the parallels between this year&amp;rsquo;s Stanley Cup Playoffs Round 1 and last year&amp;rsquo;s bitter collapse to the LA Kings.
That conversation happened last Sunday at an Easter party. The Blues were up 2-0 at the time, preparing for Game 3 in Chicago. My trepidation stemmed from the pattern emerging:
** Blues playing defending Stanley Cup Champions in Round 1 ** Steen wins Game 1 on overtime goal ** Jackman scores game winner in Game 2</description>

      <description>In 1977, the National Socialist Party (Nazi) applied to march and rally in Skokie, Illinois. Few communities want Nazis marching down their streets, but Skokie held a stronger case against the Nazis than most towns in America. About one person in every six of Skokie&amp;rsquo;s large Jewish population was a Nazi prison camp survivor.
 The debate was clear-cut: American Nazis claimed the right of free speech while their Jewish &amp;ldquo;targets&amp;rdquo; claimed the right to live without intimidation.</description>

Then you didn&amp;rsquo;t tell people about it. I mean, you didn&amp;rsquo;t blog about it. You didn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;officially&amp;rdquo; proclaim the book &amp;ldquo;required reading.&amp;rdquo;
Then something happened that you knew could happen because of the book, but you don&amp;rsquo;t get credit for calling it because you never got around to pumping the book.

I don&amp;rsquo;t know what got me onto this, exactly. I talked to Jim Durbin tonight, so maybe that was it.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for video of a speech I gave at the Million Med March in Clayton, MO, in 2009. Two-friggin-thousand-and-nine. (I&amp;rsquo;m a quarter German, so I hold a grudge.)

      <description>Karl Marx foresaw something that&amp;rsquo;s now playing out. As corporations cut labor costs to increase profits, they also destroy the markets for their goods and services.
This chart shows corporate profits (red) and wages as a percentage of GDP (blue) from 1944 to 2012:

When the blue line is higher than the red line, you get savings. For the red line to hang above the blue line, you need debt.</description>

      <description>I stand by my assessment that Chris Christie&amp;rsquo;s leadership and management played a role in the retaliatory shutdown of Fort Lee&amp;rsquo;s access lanes to the George Washington Bridge. Yesterday,I compared the GWB scandal to several Obama scandals. I pointed out that conservatives must apply the same standards to Christie as we did to Obama when the IRS scandal broke.
Today, let&amp;rsquo;s look at Christie&amp;rsquo;s response and contrast it to Obama&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>One argument put forth by conservatives&amp;ndash;and even some liberals&amp;ndash;regarding the IRS scandal was this:
Obama set a tone that encouraged IRS workers to harass conservative and Tea Party groups. He didn&amp;rsquo;t have to give a direct order. His tone and statements clearly condoned such criminal behavior toward his political enemies.
Kimberly Strassel at WSJ.com:
 Mr. Obama didn&amp;rsquo;t need to pick up the phone. All he needed to do was exactly what he did do, in full view, for three years: Publicly suggest that conservative political groups were engaged in nefarious deeds; publicly call out by name political opponents whom he&amp;rsquo;d like to see harassed; and publicly have his party pressure the IRS to take action.</description>

      <description>Ben Sasse wants to break the back of lobbying and crony capitalism by moving the seat of government from Washington to Nebraska. Sasse is a Republican candidate for US Senate from Nebraska.
Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to cripple lobbying? But Sasse&amp;rsquo;s plan won&amp;rsquo;t cripple lobbying. It will inconvenience lobbyists for a year while they resettle in the Midwest. Then it&amp;rsquo;s back to business as usual.
Before you throw up your hands and say &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s hopeless,&amp;rdquo; here&amp;rsquo;s an idea that might actually end lobbying as we know it.</description>

1975 was weird for good reasons and bad. Saturday Night Live debuted with the Not Ready For Prime Time Players: Dan Akroyd, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtain, Gilda Radner, and Garrett Morris.

I wrote about the Irish Moment and the Jewish Moment and the Gay Moment on Saturday. Three Moments enjoyed by identifiable groups of Americans. Moments that ended when the groups joined the main plot of the American story, leaving the artistic sub-plot to the next in line.
Demographics offer only one kind of Moment, though. There are cultural moments and fashion moments and, of course, political moments.</description>

      <description>The only Christmas I remember getting everything I wanted was in 1975.
First, I was finally old enough (12) to not be so shallow and needy and get pissed off if I didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly what I wanted. Santa Claus and my parents and sisters were really good to me, but until 1975 I could still get worked up if the Erector Set I got wasn&amp;rsquo;t the 118-piece set with real electric motor.</description>

      <description>The vices are, indeed, let loose, and they wander and do damage. But the virtues are let loose also; and the virtues wander more wildly, and the virtues do more terrible damage. The modern world is full of the old Christian virtues gone mad. The virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone. Thus some scientists care for truth; and their truth is pitiless.</description>

I watched Duck Dynasty once or twice. I don&amp;rsquo;t get it.
That makes me different. Fourteen million people watch the show every week. That&amp;rsquo;s more than watch any other show on television. Clearly, I&amp;rsquo;m a little odd, especially among conservatives.
That&amp;rsquo;s okay. I&amp;rsquo;m used to being weird.
I never expected that a reality TV show would stop a &amp;ldquo;moment.&amp;rdquo; But that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what&amp;rsquo;s happened.</description>

      <description>I nearly killed my nephew, Scott, when he was about seven-years-old. I was 15 or so.
We were at Sunnen Lake near Potosi, Missouri. My dad worked at Sunnen Products, and the company provided Sunnen Lake as a free recreation spot for employees and retirees. (Pretty cool perk.)
The recreation complex was pretty rustic then. About ten cabins, a recreation hall with ping-pong and a huge fireplace. The big parking lot near the Rec Hall was covered with pea-size brown and tan gravel held in place by an eight-inch railroad tie wall.</description>

      <description>A_t least once every human should have to run for his life, to teach him that milk does not come from supermarkets, that safety does not come from policemen, that ‘news’ is not something that happens to other people. He might learn how his ancestors lived and that he himself is no different–in the crunch his life depends on his agility, alertness, and personal resourcefulness.”_- Robert Heinlein

&amp;ldquo;You were on The Daily Show,&amp;rdquo; he shouted.
&amp;ldquo;I know.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;You know how big a deal that is?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Well, I was on Glenn Beck and Neill Cavuto, Larry Kudlow . . .&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Do you realize that&amp;rsquo;s been nearly five years since I wrote this post? Realizing how time&amp;rsquo;s flown since 2009, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little nostalgic this weekend.
I looked through some of Darin Morley&amp;rsquo;s excellent videos on YouTube.I searched &amp;ldquo;St. Louis Tea Party&amp;rdquo; on duckduckgo.com.
Have you thought about what&amp;rsquo;s happened?
While Russ Carnahan survived Ed Martin&amp;rsquo;s remarkable challenge in 2010, Russ is no longer in Congress, and Ed is chairman of Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Republican Party.</description>

      <description>Answer this question on paper without looking up the answer:
 Q: Which kills more people: guns or diabetes?
 Here’s what your brain is doing. It’s searching your memory for mentions of the keywords: “guns,” “diabetes,” and “kill.”
For most of us, one of the variables—guns or diabetes—carries a significantly heavier emotional weighting than the other. A paid-up-for-life member of the NRA might attach powerful positive emotions to “guns.” The parent of a child who died of complications of diabetes will attach high negative emotions to “diabetes.</description>

      <description>Sometimes a cause’s worst enemies are its best friends.

In 1995, 56 percent of American described themselves as “pro-choice.” At the time, Michael Kinsley on CNN’s Crossfire declared the debate over.
Then something strange happened. Americans started changing their minds. The pro-life movement whittled away at public opinion.
By May of this year, Gallup found “pro-choice” to be at an all-time low:
 The 41% of Americans who now identify themselves as &amp;ldquo;pro-choice&amp;rdquo; is down from 47% last July and is one percentage point below the previous record low in Gallup trends, recorded in May 2009.</description>

Well, the Democrats passed a new platform today. Two headlines emerged:
  The Democrats rejected any reference to God.
  The Democrats rejected Jerusalem as Israel&amp;rsquo;s capital.
  The question is: can you trust them? Do Democrats really reject God and reject Jerusalem as the center of Israeli political life?</description>

Before we get too far down the Akin rally road, let&amp;rsquo;s get some solid advice to Mr. Akin.
His principles, his spine, his grassroots do no good if Missouri turns blue. He cannot advance his causes from his house in Wildwood. Failure to take the Senate makes Obamacare permanent, at least in our lives.</description>

RCP aggregates dozens of polls to produce its RCP average. The method has been remarkably accurate, especially at the state level.
It’s time to focus on preventing the unmitigated disaster of a second Obama term.
In 112 days, Americans will vote on whether or not to continue our experiment in self-government. If the election were held today, that experiment would be aborted.</description>

      <description>The only surprise here is that the NYT&amp;rsquo;s own ombudsman admits that the paper is Obama&amp;rsquo;s best friend:
 Many critics view The Times as constitutionally unable to address the election in an unbiased fashion. Like a lot of America, it basked a bit in the warm glow of Mr. Obama’s election in 2008. The company published a book about the country’s first African-American president, “Obama: The Historic Journey.” The Times also published a lengthy portrait of him in its Times Topics section on NYTimes.</description>

      <description>The look on George “Stephie” Stephanopoulos’s face was priceless. He had to say it.

“ABC News now projects that President Obama will go down to defeat.”
He couldn’t bring himself to say, “Romney won” or “Republicans won.” He just couldn’t.
The network analysis was a political cliché run amok. My favorite came from James Carville who told CNN viewers that the election result “proves that crackers and racists vote.”</description>

      <description>Let me get this straight. Secret Service Agents and some military guys brought more than 20 &amp;ndash; count &amp;lsquo;em, _twenty _&amp;ndash; hookers to a hotel in Cartagena, Columbia. The Americans were drinking&amp;ndash;a lot, according to hotel staff. When the girls were ready to leave, apparently, the Americans refused to pay.
I guess these soldier or sailors or Marines don&amp;rsquo;t watch enough movies. They&amp;rsquo;d know how hookers act when they don&amp;rsquo;t get paid.</description>

First, Eric Reeve The Lake Liberal wrote this letter-to in Lake News Online. He concludes:
 We may hear of the Tea Party here and there in the future, but I doubt it will ever figure prominently in American politics again. I say we should take a moment and reflect on what it might have been as we say farewell to the once promising Tea Party movement.</description>

The two allegedly made contributions to the Democrat Party (legal), and reimbursed themselves out of Missouri Employers Mutual Insurance Company’s coffers (illegal).
But that’s not the weird part. After all, election fraud is the Democrats’ principal form of amusement.
The weird part is the statement from Griesedieck’s law firm.</description>

Mother Jones:
 Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. should be grateful to the Supreme Court for refusing to allow cameras in the courtroom, because his defense of Obamacare on Tuesday may go down as one of the most spectacular flameouts in the history of the court.</description>

First,Ginsburg statement:
 Mr. Verrilli, I thought that your main point is that, unlike food or any other market, when you made the choice not to buy insurance, even though you have every intent in the world to self-insure, to save for it, when disaster strikes, you may not have the money.</description>

**If you think the Tea Party and the conservative grassroots stands for something larger than party, then you’re needed right now. ** A great grassroots candidate in Illinois needs an hour of your time today or tomorrow–to make calls, knock doors, wave signs, or work at polls.
The GOP Establishment is pulling out all the stops. Lacking committed grassroots in Southern Illinois, they’re bringing in hired guns from Chicago and around the state.</description>

Please watch if you can. Good ratings for Tea Party guests will only increase the number of Tea Party guests.</description>

      <title>America’s Dictator</title>

      <description>From the New York Times:
 President Obama, who came to office promising transparency and adherence to the rule of law, has become the first president to claim the legal authority to order an American citizen killed without judicial involvement, real oversight or public accountability.
 In one sentence, the newspaper conservatives love to hate condemned Barack Obama to the title “dictator.”
Those who voted for him—the ones who still want to be thought of as “American”—will rationalize.</description>

      <description>The feminist attorney famous for making herself famous just couldn&amp;rsquo;t let the Sandra Fluke case go.

Gloria Allred sent a letter to a Florida District Attorney asking him to arrest Rush Limbaugh for violation of an ancient Florida law.
 The statute stipulates that anyone who “speaks of and concerning any woman, married or unmarried, falsely and maliciously imputing to her a want of chastity” is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.</description>

      <description>This is a challenge.
I want you to grab a pen and paper (or open your favorite note app). Now write down a list of characteristic you’d expect a **superhero_ _**to display. Write as many or as few as you’d like.
Don’t continue until you’ve written down the characteristics of a superhero.

Welcome back.
Here’s the next step. I want you to look over your list of superhero traits. As you do, think about the amount of that trait you have in you.</description>

      <description>What made Rush Limbaugh so amazing for 24 years was his steadfast resolve. Face it, you have to believe what you believe title your books The Way Things Ought To Be and See, I Told You So.
His fans loved him because he never backed down.
Rush didn’t back down when the left went nuts over his “Obama, The Magic Negro” parody. He didn’t back down from his “hope Obama fails” statement.</description>

      <description>A Georgetown law student turned the Democrat Party from an androgynous blob into a modern day Ivanhoe. (Yes, I’ll tread carefully around that “Ivanhoe” to spare Democrat sensibilities.)

Sandra Fluke, the student, begged Congress to confiscate property from me and millions of other taxpayers in order to satisfy her sexual appetite.
Rush Limbaugh pointed out that law school lasts three years, condoms cost about a buck each, and Ms. Fluke needed 3,000 of them just to make it to the bar exam.</description>

      <description>Think about what’s at stake: * The Supreme Court is one liberal away from imposing a radical, unwritten constitution on the United States * The President has shredded the Constitution by seizing the power to declare when the Senate is or is not in session * The United States has fallen many notches in world prestige * We can no longer fight wars on two fronts * The White House and Democrats in the Senate block every attempt at increasing domestic energy production * Our debt is approaching Greece’s catastrophic levels * The economy, after nearly four years, is flat on its back * America is losing ground on every front * And Obama made it worse</description>

      <description>Here are the top Hennessy’s View posts of each month of 2012, scientifically selected by . . . me.

January
The Gabrielle Giffords shooting by lunatic Jerod Lee Loughner was the biggest news event of the month. The cynically attempted to use the tragedy for political gain. The left failed.
February
The Arab Spring began last winter. When Mubarak was on the ropes in Egypt, some questioned whether or not his fall would be good for the region and the world.</description>

      <description>_This is the fourth in a series. If you haven’t, please read part 1, part 2, and part 3. _
Because so many school systems have driven great English literature out of students’ hands and minds, it’s possible that some kids never read Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol. If you’ve never read this classic, please do so now. You need it.

Back? Good. Fascinating stuff, isn’t it? And so much more accessible than David Copperfield, which was my introduction to Dickens.</description>

 Just a quick note that Yahoo has apparently changed their &amp;ldquo;Spam&amp;rdquo; firewall rules. You&amp;rsquo;re Tea Party updates have been showing up in my spam box for the past couple days. I can&amp;rsquo;t prove there is a conspiracy, but all of my e-mails from conservative organizations are showing up as spam while a lot of other crap is flying right through. Yahoo mail&amp;rsquo;s spam filter is supposed to be an adaptive process.</description>

      <description>Gloria in excelsis Deo. Et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis.
 The English version of the Roman Catholic Missal changed at the start of Advent. The new translation is truer to the Latin original.

The response to “The Lord be with you,” change to “And with your spirit” from “and also with you.” The Latin, et cum spiritu tuo translates exactly into “and with your spirit.”
Another change that thrills conservative Catholics, is the consecration.</description>

      <description>Have you known anyone who turned his life around?
I was in New York last week. Every day I was there, I passed hundreds of people. Each day, I met a dozen new friends. Everyone in New York, it seems, is ready to smile and have a conversation.
I thought about some of these people&amp;ndash; the young couple holding hands, the young man with a hoodie a dozen tattoos, the two models (I was in that part of town) sitting in the hotel lobby talking on their cell phones.</description>

      <description>America has but one political party capable of winning races on a scale large enough to change government practices: the Republican Party.
When the GOP takes Washington (or Jefferson City), things don&amp;rsquo;t seem to get better. Wonder why?
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a little stroll down memory lane.
 &amp;ldquo;To secure the nomination, the Dewey forces spent money and made deals and promises that Taft would never make. Offers were made of Federal jobs that Delegates could not resist.</description>

When Mark Gillar of Tea Party Power Hour asked me to come onto his show, I broke my rule. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.
First, Mark Gillar&amp;rsquo;s professionalism and sincerity are spectacular. His show is his mission to advance liberty and good government.
Second, Tea Party Power Hour has hosted some amazing guests&amp;ndash;folks I&amp;rsquo;m very honored and very humbled to follow.</description>

      <description>Maybe you scoffed at the headline. Maybe you didn&amp;rsquo;t see it. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re in denial. Or maybe you just don&amp;rsquo;t care what other people think.

If you want to stop the slide into irrelevancy (and the Tea Party movement is far down that path), then pay attention.
If, however, you like the screaming in wilderness, stop reading now. This post is for those who want to continue the mission set forth in February 2009.</description>

Read Martin’s challenge:
 Today, I am inviting both of these distinguished ladies to St Louis, Missouri to tell me and my Tea Party compatriots in person why we should go straight to Hell. Congresswoman Waters should know the way here, having been born and raised in our esteemed area and a graduate of Vashon High School, which is in the St Louis Public School District.</description>

 It was just announced in Wisconsin that the unprecedented recall elections of Republicans will take place August 9.
 The leftists dreamed. Visions of a union-boss oligarchy danced in their heads. Posters misquoted Marx and Lenin. Others wanted nothing to do with waiting two months for an election: they were ready to take up arms and violently overthrow the Wisconsin government.</description>

      <description>Warren Buffett makes the erroneous claim that he pays less in taxes than does his secretary. He claims that the government thus “coddles” the rich. He asks the government to increase his taxes, and the taxes of others like him, as if he is incapable of doing that on his own.
Buffett is half right. He proves that government coddles people by** asking the government to solve his problem of guilt**.</description>

      <description>This weekend, MoveOnUp.org held its first conference. The location was the Crowne Plaza Hotel at the airport. The event launched the Sherman T. Parker Scholarship for African-American Political Science students.
But that’s not the big story.
The big story is this: MoveOnUp.org has cheated history.
Why “cheated?” Because the past 50 years of American liberal history has prepared American blacks for one purpose: compliance.
Using victimhood, welfare, crime, destructive education, and programs designed to destroy families, American liberals from Ted Kennedy to Barack Obama chained African-Americans to “Uncle Sam’s Plantation,” as Star Parker so aptly puts it.</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s Andrew Breitbart&amp;rsquo;s commitment to African-American conservatives meeting at the Crowne Plaza Hotel at the airport in St. Louis, Missouri, yesterday.
The three-day &amp;ldquo;Meet Me in the &amp;lsquo;Lou&amp;rdquo; conference is the work of the remarkable people at MoveOnUp.org. Today&amp;rsquo;s day two, and Breitbart is the luncheon speaker.
MoveOnUp.org represents the people that the Civil Rights Industry never wants you to meet: black conservatives, escapees from what Star Parker calls &amp;ldquo;Uncle Sam&amp;rsquo;s Plantation.</description>

      <description>Rule by the cleverest brute dominated most of human history. Then came the bizarre notion – in Greece and Rome to degrees, but mostly in the USA – of rule by the governed.
Rule by the governed gave way in 20th century to rule by experts.
Many so called “conservatives” warned against the expert thing. Eventually, conservatives believed, the experts would either fall prey to the clever brutes or to a world too complex for a small group to manage.</description>

      <description>In my response to Dan Riehl’s hit piece on Ed Martin, I wrote one more line than I should have. I wrote about an establishment takeover of Big Government.
Mike Flynn, the editor of Big Government, has quietly (and not so quietly) led the fight for liberty and good government for decades. His Big Government site has been a backbone in the resurgence of our first principles.
Much more importantly to me, Mike Flynn is a friend of mine.</description>

      <description>I’ll be honest with you: I’ve lied.
Usually out of desperation. I’ve lied to those closest to me—those most willing to forgive the thing I lied about.
I’ve also told the truth to my own detriment. In the long run, the latter works best. In fact, telling the truth works best in the short run, too.
So maybe Obama’s desperate. Maybe he knows that the debt ceiling debate is the beginning of the unraveling of Americum Sovieticum, his life-long dream.</description>

      <description>Obama showed his breaking point today. The stress got to him.
Today Obama threatened to stop Social Security payments if Congress doesn’t bend to his will on the debt ceiling.
The president told reporters that there may not be enough money to pay Social Security benefits on and after August 3rd.
But the President lies.
Revenue from taxes and other fees would cover Social Security and other payments. What won’t be covered is additional borrowing to service the country’s already outrageous debt.</description>

      <description>Roy Blunt has not given an inch in thebattle over the debt ceiling. He deserves high praise for his resolve.
During the 2010 Republican primary, many on the right questioned Blunt&amp;rsquo;s fiscal conservative credentials. As a member of the House, Blunt had helped craft some and pass unpopular spending bills, including TARP. On theissue of debt and responsibility, though, he shows no sign of cracking.
Government debt is the defining issue of our time, perhaps of the American experiment.</description>

      <description>The tram cars are tiny, metal containers. Passengers&amp;ndash;six to a car&amp;ndash;sit cramped on molded plastic seats. The air inside the cars is stale and hot. There is no air conditioning.
The trams take you to the top of the 632 foot Gateway Arch in St. Louis. The uncomfortable ride takes only a few minutes.
Except when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.
Sometimes things go wrong, as they did this week. Forty people were trapped for an hour.</description>

      <description>The University of Missouri St. Louis uses tax dollars to provide a recruiting station for the Communist Party USA—an organization whose purpose is to shred the United States Constitution.
UMSL Student Philip Christofanelli heroically chronicles the remarkable Marxist indoctrination known as “Introduction to Labor Studies” on BigGovernment.com. I’ll give you a taste:
 Prof. Giljum then introduced Tony Pecinovsky, a local organizer for the Communist Party, who proceeded to speak to us for two hours about the beliefs of the Communist Party and the benefits of membership.</description>

      <description>Gail Hackett, UMKC Provost, released a deceitful, false, and irresponsible defense of UMKC instructors who encouraged students to use violence, sabotage, and intimidation to their way.
But Gail Hackett refuses to answer hard questions.
I have one question for the UMKC Provost: ****
**Do you agree with Don Giljum’s statement “I believe in a violent overthrow of Bourgeois?” **
Before you answer, remember that Giljum’s use of the personal term “Bourgois” instead of the the class “bourguoisie” indicates that Giljim believes in violence against individual members of the middle class.</description>

It’s only 5:30 here. Weird. That call that “time difference” for you lefties who read my blog. Has to do with the earth being round and all.

      <description>Did I say “Tea Party Leader?” ** I meant labor union leader Don Giljum condones violence, intimidation, and sabotage.** Giljum’s the business manager for Operating Engineers Local 148 and a lecturer at University of Missouri-St. Louis. It’s in the UMSL classroom that he pontificates and brags about the . . . the uglier side of negotiations.
Here’s what he actually said about violence for political purposes:

State Senators Jim Lembke (@jimlembke), Brian Nieves (@briannieves), Rob Schaaf (@robschaaf), and Will Kraus stood for principle. And the left immediately went berserk.
The collectivists—those who hate personal achievement and fiscal responsibility in government—will target these men. We must have their backs.
Let’s begin by telling our Twitter followers and Facebook friends how proud we are are of their brave refusal to take stolen money from Washington.</description>

      <description>According to a book by historians Neil Howe and William Strauss, history follows a fairly predictable pattern, rotating in cycles equal to a long human life. The book, The Fourth Turning, was written in 1997.
Read it.
If Howe and Strauss are right—and so far, they’re dead on—then we recently entered a Fourth Turning in the current saeculum which they named “millennium.”
What is a Fourth Turning?
 The Fourth Turning is a Crisis, a decisive era of secular upheaval, when the values regime propels the replacement of the old civic order with a new one.</description>

      <description>Doing the right thing is hard.
Doing the right thing after years of practicing the wrong things is even harder.
When your senate separated the fiscal responsibility provisions affecting union collective bargaining powers from a bill that previously included tax and spend provisions, you took a big step toward fiscal recovery.
For years, public sector unions have dictated states’ taxing spending policies through brute force. These unions were not elected by the people, but the people were forced to pay—or borrow—what the unions demanded.</description>

Others (see www.24thstate. com) have documented the board’s odd history and surprising success. I’ve pointed out that the Constitution is silent on the matter. With legislation coming to a vote, I’ll state my personal position flat out.
I believe that abolishing the Board would be a setback, not just for St. Louis Police Officers, not just for the city of St.</description>

Andrew Breitbart points out on Twitter that his cowardly leftist accusors, including Markos Moulitsas and Eric Boehlert, quieted down on their libelous attacks on Breitbart, Palin, Bush, and Tea Party.
These leftist cowards shut up only after it became undeniably clear that the evil bastard who shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 11 others is not a tea partier, but a deranged socialist.</description>

      <description>The clock is ticking on dozens of Democrat congressional careers. And a band of activists in Missouri are helping the losers move.
Operation “Pack Up and Get Out” struck the offices of Rep. Russ Carnahan (D-MO) today. Carnahan is struggling to hold off Republican challenger Ed Martin, an original Tea Partier whose campaign has energized Missouri’s 3rd Congressional District.

“Pack Up and Get Out” delivered 300 moving boxes to the Congressman’s offices in Brentwood, Missouri.</description>

      <description>“Winning isn’t everything—it’s the only thing.” &amp;ndash; Bud Wilkinson
Think you can vote without a plan? Maybe you can. Or maybe you’ll get too busy, traffic will be a mess, the weather will turn bad, or your boss will send you on a wild goose chase at 5:30. Without a voting plan, there’s a chance that Missouri will be stuck with a clown like Russ Carnahan.
So let’s make a plan.</description>

      <description>Tonight at Victory Center, the phones were packed with volunteers, and it made a difference. We made over 1,600 calls and canvassers visited over 200 homes. But it gets better.

Because of the energy and enthusiasm in the room, the quality of the calls was fantastic. Veteran callers said that the people they spoke to were more engaged and pleasant than on past nights. That’s because success and energy drives enthusiasm, which people respond to even over the phone.</description>

      <description>Symbols can change history. Sort of.
I was on patrol on the USS John C. Calhoun in January 1992. I sat in the Crew&amp;rsquo;s Lounge. Ed Lesage, a radioman, delivered the latest news from the wire—usually a few days old. I got the first copy. The first story told me that President George H. W. Bush would not be re-elected.
I was right.
This morning, I saw a story on RealClearPolitics.</description>

      <description>The venerable Jim Hoft (aka, Gateway Pundit) snapped this shot of the new sign at St. Louis Tea Party Coalition HQ on Hampton.

One year ago this week, we’d just finished a summer of street protests. ObamaCare had been delayed . . . twice. Cap and Trade had been put on hold. Many of us were getting ready to drive up to Quincy, Illinois, for the Midwest’s 9-12 Tea Party.</description>

      <description>A lot.
Today, Congress gave failing states and cities $26 billion in Chinese loans. More failed policies bolstered.
Today, the Federal Reserve Board reversed its plan to pay down the debt in order to put off economic downturn until after the election.
Today, the Fed announced that our future is bleak.
Today, we learned that the government probably overstated 2nd quarter economic growth—by almost double. (h/t Ed Morrissey)
Today, we learned that inventories increased because people and businesses aren’t buying.</description>

      <title>The Return of Marcos</title>

      <description>No,not Marie Antoinette. Too clichéd and too . . . ancient. Rather, Michelle Obama’s opulent life rekindles fond memories of Imelda Marcos.
Imelda Marcos was the wife of Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos. Marcos was more a dictator than a president. Another parallel. In 1986, the Filipinos and the world had enough. Marcos was deposed and Imelda’s extravagance exposed.
Imelda Marcos’s closet contained 2,700 pairs of shoes. That’s a different pair of shoes every day for 7.</description>

      <description>Missouri voters roundly rejected ObamaCare, all of its works, and all of its empty promises.

      <description>No, I’m not a war monger. But peace is not the absence of war. It’s the presence of peace.

If you live in Israel, you are not at peace. You are at war. War against a massive body of people who want to destroy you before they move on to destroy Christendom. If Christendom doesn’t destroy itself first.
So let’s all thank Israel for standing tall on the front lines of this epic battle between good and evil.</description>

      <title>Taxpayers to Bailout SEIU?</title>

      <description>Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) wants you to pay $165 billion to bail out organized crimeunions. Actually, the bill heading toward taxpayers is unlimited and could reach into the trillions:
 Although right now taxpayers could possibly be on the hook for $165 billion, the liability could essentially be unlimited because these pensions have to be paid out until the workers die.
 Remember why we took to the streets for the first Tea Party Protests in 2009?</description>

      <description>Tomorrow, Tuesday, April 6, is Election Day in St. Louis County. In some places, especially throughout South County, the only measure on the ballot is Proposition A: a sales tax increase.
Prop A’s backers—principally County Exec Charlie Dooley and Chesterfield Mayor John Nations—claim this tax increase of up to $650 per family will allow Metro to grow. You know otherwise.
* Dooley and Nations cannot point to a specific plan. They point to four.</description>

**
We sat at a hi-top table for four at John D. McGurk&amp;rsquo;s Irish (duh) Pub in South St. Louis. Cold filled my being down to the soul. I&amp;rsquo;d been outside in the rain for the better part of two days. My favorite sport coat, soaked, lay in the back seat of my Jeep. My shirts clung to my shivering skin. My penny loafers made the sound of swishing mouth-rinse with every step.</description>

      <description>John is a Vietnam veteran and retired business executive. He loves America and hates to see what’s happened in Washington the past few years. He believes in liberty and Constitutional limitations on government growth.
He called the Tea Party just to vent and to see if it’s just him.
Recently, John had called Senator Kit Bond’s (R-MO) office in Washington. He wanted to know whether stories that Bond had signed off a $659 million earmark for soy bean farmers were true.</description>

      <description>According to Tweeters in the streets of Mumbai outside Nariman House, the Jewish Center, NSG Commandos (Indian special forces) are high-fiving people in the streets. The crowds are singing patriot songs. No gunfire.
Meanwhile, 30 or more bodies were found in the Oberoi hotel.
I hope the West takes a lesson from NSG&amp;rsquo;s fierce, straight-on attack on the terrorists.
Also, have you noticed that our Western, pro-terrorist media (CNN, NY Times, LA Times, MSNBC) refuse to call the Mumbai terrorists &amp;ldquo;terrorists?</description>

      <description>Is Mumbai a test run for an attack on the United States?
 Al Qaeda is out of practice. The terror organization has been quite since 2001, pinned down inside in Iraq where our heroes destroyed their efforts to establish a beach head.
The coincidence of the horror in Mumbai with the FBI reports of a serious, legitimate threat to the NYC subway system seems coordinated to me.
Since 9-11, the US, UK, and Israel have trained and developed anti-terrorism techniques jointly with many nations, including India.</description>

      <description>If you tell a child he&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; for long enough, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance he&amp;rsquo;ll turn out badly. If you tell the country loudly enough that we&amp;rsquo;re on brink of the worst financial meltdown since The Great Depression, consumer and investor behavior might just bring it on. After 30 years of us conservatives calling the major media a bunch leftists Marxists seeking to overthrow capitalism through selective burying and publishing of news, we might have expected one day to be right.</description>

Barabara West asked Biden hard hitting questions&amp;ndash;almost as hard-hitting as questions routinely fired at GOP Vice President candidate Sarah Palin. At one point, Biden said, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know who&amp;rsquo;s writing your questions,&amp;rdquo; showing his surprised that West was making up questions rather than reading the ones written for her by the Obama campaign.</description>

      <description>Time magazine&amp;rsquo;s Karen Tumulty says that criticizing Franklin Raines&amp;ndash;the heart and soul of our current economic near-meltdown&amp;ndash;is racism because . . . Raines is black.
Therefore, criticizing any black is racism.
I&amp;rsquo;ve criticized and accused Franklin Raines brutally in the past two weeks, so I must be a regular David Dukes. Perhaps Karen Tumulty needs to change her meds.
Readers may not believe this, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize Raines was black until after I&amp;rsquo;d posted the second of my blog posts linking to Obama to Raines and Johnson and others responsible for the housing bubble and meltdown.</description>

As an executive at Fannie Mae, Franklin Raines illegally coerced his employees to falsify accounting facts so he&amp;rsquo;d get a maximum bonus. The government-backed firm used Enron-like fraud, in part at Raines&amp;rsquo;s orders, to create the largest bail-out in US history.</description>

Quinn, who said a woman with 5 children has no business holding an important job, is, herself, a working mother. Perhaps Quinn is a slacker, though.</description>

Only Hurricane Gustav&amp;rsquo;s untimely arrival spared us from 24 hours of Bristol Palin&amp;rsquo;s sex life on CNN. Every political/talk host on the network devoted the majority of his show to the subject.</description>

      <description>More bad news about John McCain&amp;rsquo;s selection for Vice President emerged tonight. Sarah Palin was cited for fishing without a license.
CNN is sending a team of reporters and producers to Wasilla, Alaska, to cover this emerging scandal.
The citation does not indicate what she was fishing with or for, but the fact that a would-be Vice President of the United States did, with malice aforethought, cast her line into known fishing waters with the intent of extracting&amp;ndash;or reasonably expecting to extract&amp;ndash;a live fish demonstrates her unfitness for office of any kind.</description>

Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s eldest daughter, Bristol, is pregnant and will marry Levi, the child&amp;rsquo;s father, Todd and Sarah said today in a press release [FoxNews.com].
 The 17-year-old unwed daughter of John McCain’s new running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, is five-months pregnant, Palin and her husband, Todd Palin, said Monday in a written statement.
 McCain’s campaign told FOX News that the presumptive Republican presidential candidate knew about Bristol Palin’s pregnancy before he chose Palin as his running mate last Friday, and that Bristol is planning to marry the father of her child.</description>

      <description>The Marine who was charged in civilian court with murder for doing his job on terrorists in Iraq was found NOT GUILTY (h/t wizbang) by a jury of his peers.
Congratulations to Jose Luis Nazario! Thank you, Marine, for you proud and noble service to me, my family, and our country. Thank you, jurors, for rejected the sick arguments of that jack-booted thug federal prosecutor. May this serve as a warning to anti-military prosecutors.</description>

      <description>On Friday, the New York Times refused to publish an op-ed piece by Republican nominee John McCain (FoxNews.com). This might be the first time in American history that a newspaper turned down a column by a presidential candidate from a major party. According to Jonathan Martin of Politico, the Times demanded that McCain include &amp;ldquo;timetables&amp;rdquo; for withdrawal if he wants NYT inches. This also demonstrates why liberalism is incompatible with democracy.</description>

      <description>The Associated Press, long upset that people often quote and link to its stories on the internet, has imposed a $2.50 per word fee for bloggers who wish to quote one of its stories.
I understand. It&amp;rsquo;s tough to have a lot of people driving web traffic to your site. Considering the number of articles attributed to the AP, the cost of servers and bandwidth must be outrageous.
But I have a solution: Stop posting stories on the internet.</description>

      <description>Pope Benedict XVI will receive the highest honor the United States can bestow upon on a visiting head of state: the President will meet him at the airport. Afterwards, the White House will host the largest gathering of Bush&amp;rsquo;s presidency, as over 12,000 guests will receive His Holiness. Quite an honor.
Sadly, Catholic hate mobs will be out in force, too. Excommunicates who believe they know God&amp;rsquo;s designs for the church better than the Pope will travel from St.</description>

      <description>Barack Obama told the world what he thinks of rural people, and, in so doing, sealed his fate [from Powerline]:
 So it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising then that they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren&amp;rsquo;t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.
 Wow. Rev. Wright taught him well. (h/t Gateway Pundit)

      <description>When Drudge devotes his middle column to the collapse of Congress under Democrat control, you know the Dems are in trouble.
Citing four hit pieces in major papers, including The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post (here and here), USA Today, and The Hill, the DrudgeReport does to Pelosi and Reid what no amount of Republican advertising could ever do; he proves that Democrats are unfit to run the government.
USA Today&amp;rsquo;s editorial eviscerates Democrats on the war.</description>

      <description>. . . you have to do it yourself.
That&amp;rsquo;s the MSM&amp;rsquo;s motto over the upcoming Patraeus report to Congress on progress in Iraq.
The facts are obvious: since the surge and offensive began, the terrorists in Iraq have become less effective. The surge and the offensive are working. Those who agree with this view inlude these liberals and Democrats:

      <description>Just a few days, other bloggers (Captain Ed) and I speculated on the ramifications on Democrat surrender strategies of the increasingly obvious improvements in Iraq since the surge began. Ever the WaPo worried about how the Dems would deal.
Now we know: propaganda.
Following the phony story that Gen. Pace would urge the President to cut troops in Iraq by half, the Red Crescent, today, released a report that a record number of Iraqis have fled their homes in fear of their lives since the surge began.</description>

      <description>For a couple of days, the wingnuts have been ecstatic over a story that Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Peter Pace would tell President Bush to cut Iraqi troop strength in half. I first heard the story on CBS Radio News Friday morning on my way to work. TheLA Times, quoting anonymous Pentagon and Administration officials, printed the the story in its Friday edition.
But the story was a fabrication, likely designed to quell the growing support for the war.</description>

But looking around the internet, I find bad news all over. It was one of those days when the world&amp;rsquo;s rhythms crossed into bad vibes.
Some of those vibrations shook the earth in Peru, to the tune of 8.0 on the Richter scale, killing at least 850, probably more.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the editorials on the editorial pages, but the remarkably blatant editorializing in the &amp;ldquo;news&amp;rdquo; stories covering Karl Rove&amp;rsquo;s resignation from the White House.
An AP story by Terence Hunt retrieved from news.myway.com begins by describing the whole of the Bush administration as &amp;ldquo;turbulent.&amp;rdquo; Perhaps, but the color of the paragraph indicates that the turbulence was Rove&amp;rsquo;s fault. If blaming Rove was Hunt&amp;rsquo;s intention, then Hunt must believe Rove ordered the Islamofascist hijackers to fly airplanes into buildings.</description>

      <description>It’s hard to understand why the United Nations in the late 1940s worked so hard to establish the Jewish state of Israel. Sadism? Since Israel’s declaration of independence, the UN has, more or less, condemned everything the country has done. Were Israel to play by the United Nations’ rules, the world’s only Jewish state would have ceased to exist several decades ago.
Still, it persists. They persist, I should say. The government, the land, does not persist.</description>
