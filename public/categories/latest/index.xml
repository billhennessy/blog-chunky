      <description>Sorry for the interruption, but we’ve worked out the kinks.
Do you want to show the world your colors?
Do you want to say, “I’m a tea partier?”
Do you want your style to shout, “FREEDOM!”
Then get to the official St. Louis Tea Party store and stock up. We’ve added T.E.A. ball caps to go with the T.E.A Special Forces t-shirts (our best seller).
You’ll look terrific reading Zen Conservatism in your Tea Party Hoodie!</description>

      <description>** You Can Order My Book Online Today **Zen Conservatism is now available in paperback.
I began this book in December 2008, just after the election. My goal was to produce a book that would inspire people to restore our republic. At the time, conservatives were disheartened, dismayed, and distracted.
Then the Tea Party movement began, and I had to put my book project on hold. But thanks to your work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to return to my project.</description>

      <description>The St. Louis Globe-Democrat is back as an online newspaper. That’s good news for all of us, regardless of their editorial positions. The other paper in St. Louis has fallen without competition. People have found alternatives.</description>

      <description>John is a Vietnam veteran and retired business executive. He loves America and hates to see what’s happened in Washington the past few years. He believes in liberty and Constitutional limitations on government growth.
He called the Tea Party just to vent and to see if it’s just him.
Recently, John had called Senator Kit Bond’s (R-MO) office in Washington. He wanted to know whether stories that Bond had signed off a $659 million earmark for soy bean farmers were true.</description>

      <description>The most disappointing thing about leaving the military is that it usually means leaving the last bastion of leadership in America. If you open your own business or freelance, you probably don’t notice the cowardly bastards populating corner offices in most American enterprises. You’d puke, as Holden Caulfield might say.
John Mackey of Whole Foods had the courage to oppose socialized medicine AND to defend his position and his right to say it.</description>

      <description>My new ebook, Zen Conservatism, will be available for download ($9.50) within the week. To prepare, I’ve posted the first chapter which you can download for free.
Here’s more about the book:
You consider yourself a patriot and a proud American.
You have become more and more concerned about the direction your country is headed.
You wish you could just yell “STOP!” –and someone would listen.
“Zen Conservatism,” was written for you.</description>

      <description>Borrowing liberally from Americans United for Separation of Church and State, let’s adopt this manifesto of our resolve to keep the government from taking over (via voluntary non-profit status) the free press in the United States:
 Americans have more publishing freedom than any people in world history. We can choose what to read; what to teach our children; how, where and when to write; which causes to give money to; or even whether we want to get involved with the news at all.</description>

      <description>Organizing for America is opening a new office in St. Louis this Wednesday, November 4th. I&amp;rsquo;d like to invite you to come see the new space and join us as we write letters to our representatives in Congress.
With the full House and Senate set to start debating final plans for health insurance reform, we&amp;rsquo;re closer than we&amp;rsquo;ve ever been to passing real reform. But to do so this year, we need your involvement &amp;ndash; building support for the President&amp;rsquo;s plan, spreading the facts, and bringing new voices into this debate.</description>

      <description>RealityStudio » Dr. Benway Operates
 Dr. Benway is operating in an auditorium filled with students: “Now, boys, you won’t see this operation performed very often and there’s a reason for that…. You see it has absolutely no medical value. No one knows what the purpose of it originally was or if it had a purpose at all. Personally I think it was a pure artistic creation from the beginning.</description>

      <description>Watts Up With That has a graph illustrating the ridiculous extent to which James Hansen has gone to perpetuate his global warming myth. Hansen has rewritten US temperature data of the past 2 centuries&amp;ndash;as if he was there.
It&amp;rsquo;s time for NASA to fire Hansen. The DOJ should open a fraud investigation.

      <description>In Honduras, the military overthrew a democratically elected president who used his election to seize dictatorial powers. Good for the military, which acted on a Supreme Court order. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope the SCOTUS will have the berries to shut down TheOne&amp;rsquo;s continuing slide into despotism.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s not a party.
It&amp;rsquo;s not a day off work.
It&amp;rsquo;s a memorial to those who placed freedom, liberty, and dignity above the tiny distractions of life. We memorialize the moments of our heroes&amp;rsquo; lives&amp;ndash;moments that defined their legacy in God&amp;rsquo;s book.

      <description>_While the Tea Party movement was and remains non-partisan, the dangers to freedom posed by this man, Barack Obama, are too serious to protect his name with euphemisms. The Tea Party movement is the only active resistance to this administration&amp;rsquo;s dictatorial seizure of power. _
Today, a government official leaked plans for a permanent government takeover of General Motors. On the heels of the administration&amp;rsquo;s repeal of contract law and elimination of 200 years of bankruptcy case law, this could signal the end of private ownership of manufacturing companies in America.</description>

      <description>In &amp;ldquo;Blink*&amp;rdquo; Malcolm Gladwell explains the human mind&amp;rsquo;s remarkable ability to arrive at truth instaneously. The book&amp;rsquo;s first story involves a Greek statue scientifically proven to be authentic . . . except that every human expert who sees it instinctively knows something&amp;rsquo;s wrong. Turns out, of course, that the humans are right and science is wrong. The statue was a fraud.
When I first heard the story of the AF1 fly-over of New York City that created panic on Wall Street, I immediately, instinctively knew that it the publicity photo story was wrong.</description>

      <title>Let&#39;s Honor Kemp with Inflation-Indexed Bonds</title>

      <description>One single legislative act will stop government overspending in its tracks.
In 1978, Representative Jack Kemp (R-NY) proposed legislation (which had no chance of passage in Tip O&amp;rsquo;Neill&amp;rsquo;s Democrat Congress) designed to stop the government from defrauding investors with inflation: bond indexing. The measure would have the additional value of discouraging government spending.
Ronald Reagan and Milton Friedman endorsed Kemp&amp;rsquo;s proposal. Let&amp;rsquo;s dust off this bill and push it through Congress as a memorial to Jack Kemp.</description>

      <description>In the battle between conservatives and statists, a fundamental difference seems to lie in the meaning of a concept found in the Declaration of Independence:
 Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed[.]
 The dispute is how men convey consensual powers to their government.
Conservatives believe that governmental power is conveyed exclusively through the Constitution; statists believe power is conveyed through elections.</description>

      <description>The statists are moving faster through the Constitution than Hitler moved through France. Today, Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to advance a bill to socialize medicine without debate.
 House Democrats went on record again in favor of advancing the legislation while allowing only limited debate, which would hobble the ability of Republicans to wrest concessions on one of Obama&amp;rsquo;s top domestic priorities.

Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp wanted to index everything, especially Treasury notes and taxes. By &amp;ldquo;indexing,&amp;rdquo; we mean tying rates (interest and tax) to the inflation rate. Calls for indexing subsided after Reagan and Volcker did what Ford and Carter could not: whip inflation now.
With a $2 trillion deficit this year and multi-trillion deficits projected as far as the eye can see, inflation will return to ravage the American consumer.</description>

      <description>This is my last post on Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View, at least for some time. My work for the St. Louis Tea Party movement is very important to me and, in my opinion, to you. Our government is moving quickly to obliterate all vestiges of the free market republic that America once was. With the Republican party in disarray and the Democrat party in the hands of statist despots, the tea partiers are the only thing standing between liberty and tyranny.</description>

UPDATE: Fox News now has banner but no story.
UPDATE: Fox News moves fast. From Sky News Service quoting Rafael Abreu Hael of U.S. Geological Survey:
 &amp;ldquo;This is a significant earthquake,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;This is a shallow quake but there is definitely a possibility of damage and even injuries. It is going to depend on what type of buildings are in the area.</description>

In a just world, the good people of Connecticut would toss this demagogue AG into the Thames River on the coldest day of the year.</description>

Before Obama destroys your kids’ minds in his “let’s kill all the productive people” Nazi-Marxist youth camps, make them read the seminal work on conservatism by Mark Levin.
Having authored a Conservative Manifesto myself, I am confident that this book is the definitive thought on conservatism.
If you’re new to politics and activism, you need this primer. It will arm you with the verbal and intellectual ammunition you need send the scrawny rabble rouser we call a president back to the slimy rock he crawled out from under.</description>

I know this is a little late, but I was waiting for Congress to spend another trillion dollars or so before committing my prediction to the public. Here goes:
GDP and unemployment will flatten and even improve a bit in first half of 2009 for a couple of reasons:
First, people will begin to look for excuses to spend money. This includes businesses.
Second, the hideous transfer of power from individuals to government that passed Congress on Friday will have a psychological effect on people making some believe that things will get better soon.</description>

      <description>Two quick global warming notes.
Arctic Sea Ice Extend Growing
Not too long ago, Al Gore told German school kids that the North Pole, Santa, Polar Bears, and puppies would all be dead and rotting hunks of diseased fleshed in barren, desserts that were once the Arctic Sea by the time they entered high school. Turns out that the Arctic Sea Ice Extent for 2007-08 and 2008-09 is pretty much in the average for entire history of measured sea ice extent (1979 to present).</description>

      <description>Go Dana. How &amp;lsquo;bout a little equal time? Why does the WU prof get 80 percent of the time?
DELETED VIDEO EMBED
I detest videos that start automatically. You can see the report on KSDK&amp;rsquo;s web site. Not the best coverage, certainly not fair, but publicity is publicity. So thanks to Rebecca for visiting with Dana and selecting 7 seconds of the interview to air ahead of 30 minutes of some college professor who wrote a book in his spare time.</description>

Americans hold hundreds of billions of dollars in credit card debt alone. To this add automobiles, student loans, mortgages, medical, and myriad personal loans and you arrive at the staggering figure of$2.55 trillion with a &amp;lsquo;t&amp;rsquo;. 
This massive debt&amp;ndash;encouraged and backed by the US Government&amp;ndash;makes us miserable. Seriously. Are you happy? If the debtor is slave to his lender, then the US Government is slave to China and Japan.</description>

Just another sign that democracy in America is over. In November, Change.gov banned conservatives from asking questions or offering suggestions to Barack Obama.

What does &amp;ldquo;expanding the middle class&amp;rdquo; entail, exactly? The government has spent tens of trillions of dollars trying to elevate the poor to middle class.</description>

 General Motors, like the other two geezers of the Old Three, is a vast retirement home with a small loss-making auto subsidiary. The UAW is the AARP in an Edsel: It has three times as many retirees and widows as “workers” (I use the term loosely). GM has 96,000 employees but provides health benefits to a million people.</description>

      <description>Is Mumbai a test run for an attack on the United States?
 Al Qaeda is out of practice. The terror organization has been quite since 2001, pinned down inside in Iraq where our heroes destroyed their efforts to establish a beach head.
The coincidence of the horror in Mumbai with the FBI reports of a serious, legitimate threat to the NYC subway system seems coordinated to me.
Since 9-11, the US, UK, and Israel have trained and developed anti-terrorism techniques jointly with many nations, including India.</description>

      <description>At the current rate of decline in Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s definition of &amp;ldquo;the rich,&amp;quot; by June 2009, anyone earning more than $20,136 a year will get a tax increase.
Since July 2008, Obama&amp;rsquo;s definition of rich has been declining at rate of 20 percent per month. Simple extrapolation shows that even minimum wage earners will face a tax increase by the time any legislation can be enacted in June 2009.
In other words, Obama&amp;rsquo;s real definition of &amp;ldquo;rich&amp;rdquo; is: &amp;ldquo;you have a job.</description>

      <description>After showing signs of life following Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s top-shelf performance against Joe Biden on Friday, McCain reminded me of an addict who fell off the wagon. He&amp;rsquo;s addicted to boredom. It was like previous horrendous performances by Republican Senior Guardsmen: Bob Dole in 1996, George H. W. Bush in 1992. Did McCain look at his watch?
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, folks, but this guy does not want to be president. I have no doubt that he did.</description>

Harry Reid&amp;rsquo;s office sent a press release describing Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s speech as &amp;ldquo;shrill&amp;rdquo; in response to Palin&amp;rsquo;s shot at Reid&amp;rsquo;s declaration of surrender. What a wuss.

      <description>A fe months ago, only conservatives and Republicans were talking about Obama&amp;rsquo;s arrogance. Now, everyone&amp;rsquo;s noticing it.
 Something about Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s manner bothers Margaret Cowan.
 &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s something egotistical about him,&amp;rdquo; the Sheridan, Colo., retiree said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the way he struts around.&amp;rdquo;
Many swing voters here and throughout the country consider the presumptive Democratic nominee distant, pompous, arrogant, even elitist. [Kansas City Star]
Democrat consultants say Obama&amp;rsquo;s arrogance is a real issue that needs to be addressed.</description>

Wow. Smart, smart man. Only . . . most colleges don&amp;rsquo;t have an IQ requirement. George W. Bush has degrees from Yale and Harvard, but his IQ is, like, 28 according to Biden. I guess whatever schools Biden went to, they give diplomas based on IQ instead of credit hours.</description>

      <description>Do you remember the summer of 2007? Reporters found John McCain carrying his own baggage through an airport and looking defeated and dissheveled. In debt, at the bottom of the polls, and old, the MSM declared his campaign over.
They were wrong. So was I.
Somehow, McCain staged a masterful comeback, and I use the word &amp;ldquo;masterful&amp;rdquo; advisedly. His comeback was not spectacular or flamboyant or even memorable. It was quiet, consistent, and strong.</description>

      <description>The U.N. Secretary-General is quite furious at Denmark for permitting Geert Wilder&amp;rsquo;s film &amp;ldquo;Fitna&amp;rdquo; from seeing the light of day, according to Reuters.
 &amp;ldquo;Freedom must always be accompanied by social responsibility,&amp;rdquo; Ban said.
&amp;ldquo;We must also recognize that the real fault line is not between Muslim and Western societies, as some would have us believe, but between small minorities of extremists, on different sides, with a vested interest in stirring hostility and conflict,&amp;rdquo; Ban said.</description>

      <description>With a week separating us from Obama&amp;rsquo;s Race speech, we can look to the real lesson it taught: Barack Obama lacks the personal courage required of leaders.
Since the Rev. Jeremiah Wright controversy reached the tipping point with The O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Factor on Thursday a week ago, Obama has pointed many fingers and blamed many people, including his &amp;ldquo;typical white person&amp;rdquo; grandmother. But most politicians dodge blame. What demonstrates Obama&amp;rsquo;s remarkable lack of courage was his direct dealings with a man he professes to love: the Rev.</description>

      <description>Liberals, as a group, display a genetic inaptitude toward history. &amp;ldquo;Liberal historian,&amp;rdquo; then, becomes oxymoronic.
One example of the phenomenon comes from the cult of Global Warming.
The brilliant Anthony Watts has uncovered some old newspapers from 1922 and 1933 that prove my point very well. From the Washington Post of November 2, 1922, we learn that the death of the Arctic ice cap was nigh:
 The Arctic ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot, according to a report to the Commerce Department yesterday from Consul Ifft, at Bergen, Norway.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s fatwa from the new pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, the separatist and anti-American church in which Barack Obama bends his knee, places a pivotal decision before the senator: he is either with them or against them.
The church, whose manifesto and pastor spoke indefensible words of separatism and hate, could have taken its lumps, reformed, and move on. Instead, under the direction of the Reverend Otis Moss II, it came out swinging.</description>

      <description>If America still has a serious racial divide, then black preachers may be the chief perpetuators.
The Power of the Black Pulpit
The preacher is a powerful, revered figured in black Christian communities (Jones, 1989). Good families teach their children to learn from and emulate the preacher&amp;rsquo;s words and actions. According to Kirk Byron Jones,
 The roots of black preachers&amp;rsquo; prerogative and power are in the soils of African religion and American racism.</description>

 Sen. Barack Obama on Saturday decried &amp;ldquo;the forces of division&amp;rdquo; over race that he said are intruding into the Democratic presidential nomination contest.
 Remember that Jeremiah Wright is Barack&amp;rsquo;s spiritual advisor of 20 years. So,isn&amp;rsquo;t this a matter of the pot calling the kettle . . . African-American?

 Lacking a clear route to the selection of a Democratic presidential nominee, the party&amp;rsquo;s uncommitted superdelegates say they are growing increasingly concerned about the risks of a prolonged fight between Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, and perplexed about how to resolve the conflict.
 And these people want to deal with the Middle East?</description>

      <description>Ace of Spades describes this breaking story as &amp;ldquo;nuclear&amp;rdquo; for the Obama campaign. I agree.
Obama&amp;rsquo;s only defense in the Rev. Jeremiah Wright scandal was to claim he never heard vitriol spew from Wright&amp;rsquo;s mouth. Many pundits, including Obama supporters, warned that any evidence putting Obama in that church during an ant-US, anti-white hate sermon would be Obama&amp;rsquo;s undoing. He&amp;rsquo;d be a proven petty liar.
Looks like he is:
  Wright laced into America&amp;rsquo;s establishment, blaming the &amp;ldquo;white arrogance&amp;rdquo; of America&amp;rsquo;s Caucasian majority for the woes of the world, especially the oppression suffered by blacks.</description>

 It&amp;rsquo;s Obama 46% Clinton 45%** **(see recent daily results). This reflects an unusually sharp change from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s results when Obama led by eight points and reached the 50% level of support for the first time.
 That&amp;rsquo;s really bad news for Obama. If either of these stories ever reaches the front pages of a newspaper, he might need to work on his withdrawal speech.</description>

 it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely clear why al Qaeda is so desperate to avoid a President McCain. I suppose there&amp;rsquo;s some propaganda value to a female president that could be exploited; if anything, the opposite would be true in the case of a President Obama. Do they envision a radically more terrorist-friendly foreign policy?</description>

Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s wife is unabashedly anti-American. His spiritual advisor is more so. That advisor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, hates white people, too. When the person with whom you choose to live your life and the person from whom you seek guidance for your thoughts and actions are known anti-American bigots, people are justified in assuming you are like them.</description>

In our argument we contend that scientific proof has no meaning to these miscreants. They are bent on economic and political control, not a healthy eco-system.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t believe us, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll believe one of them.

      <description>Roger Kreutz dashed to right a wrong. A tiny wrong, by modern standards, but a wrong nonetheless. &amp;ldquo;Dammit,&amp;rdquo; Roger might have thought, &amp;ldquo;you can&amp;rsquo;t even enjoy a quiet cup of coffee anymore.&amp;rdquo; Then he sprang into action.
Aaron Poisson has a girlfriend and a car. And he&amp;rsquo;s out of high school. That&amp;rsquo;s a liberating combination to a young man. The boundaries of his youth&amp;ndash;walls to many young men aching to break the chains of childhood&amp;ndash;are far behind him.</description>

      <description>ABCNews gave up on a section of itsweb site dedicated to scaring people to death about global warming. [Link corrected]
The site is still up, but no new material has hit the site since September 2007, when the coldest winter on record began.
 I know that liberals are cowards, liars, frauds, and criminals, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t think they were this shallow. To just stop posting when the news turned against them?</description>

      <description>Karl Roves cites three possible affects of the prolonged Democrat nomination process on John McCain&amp;rsquo;s chances:
  Clinton and Obama bloody each other, leaving the Democrats with a &amp;ldquo;damaged goods&amp;rdquo; candidate for the general election.
  The excitement of a brokered convention draws millions of sideliners into the political process, mostly on the Democrat side, giving whoever wins that party&amp;rsquo;s nomination a leg up.
  The protracted race pushes McCain off the front pages, allowing the Democrats to define McCain in any light they choose.</description>

      <description>The Catholic Church is often wrongly accused of suppressing science throughout the so-called Dark Ages. Legend has it that the Church used her secular influence over divine-right monarchs to thwart scientific inquiry.
It&amp;rsquo;s all hooey, of course. During the Medieval period, the lack of an economic system that generated surplus left the Church alone to advance science, translate texts, and preserve history.
But that&amp;rsquo;s a different story.
Al Gore and his band of merry thought police are doing to science what the left claims the church did&amp;ndash;slitting the throats of anyone who dares speak heresies against the Global Warming god.</description>

      <description>Pay attention to this little news bit: Chavez sends troops to Colombian border.
Chavez is a Stalinist, and Stalin founded and expanded the Soviet Union with a combination of force, threats, and promises. Every Soviet student expects Chavez to follow suit.
 President Hugo Chavez on Sunday ordered 10 battalions of troops to the border with Colombia after Colombia&amp;rsquo;s military killed a top rebel leader.
He called the U.S.-allied government in Bogota &amp;ldquo;a terrorist state&amp;rdquo; and labeled President Alvaro Uribe &amp;ldquo;a criminal.</description>

 On Wednesday, CTV reported that a senior member of Obama&amp;rsquo;s campaign called the Canadian government within the last month &amp;ndash; saying that when Senator Obama talks about opting out of the free trade deal, the Canadian government shouldn&amp;rsquo;t worry.</description>

David Brooks&amp;rsquo; masterful obituary of William F. Buckley in the New York Times gives that paper a reprieve, however short, from the right&amp;rsquo;s vituperations.
 National Review&amp;rsquo;s readers no doubt shared a hatred for Communism, but many of them simply wanted to be like Buckley.

After a visit to Iraq, Jolie announces that America has
an obligation to win.
 My visit left me even more deeply convinced that we not only have a moral obligation to help displaced Iraqi families, but also a serious, long-term, national security interest in ending this crisis.
 For the many Americans who live and die by the advice of Hollywood celebrities, this story could turn the tide of public opinion&amp;ndash;if it gets more play in the MSM.</description>

      <description>Demonstrating a remarkable daftness for thinking on his feet, Barack Obama magnified the folly of a debate gaffe, today, in a clumsy rejoinder to John McCain&amp;rsquo;s response.
In a debate, Obama said he would deploy troops back into Iraq, after a pullout, if al Qaeda established bases. (Do I really need to point out the lack of intelligence, understanding, and strategy his comment portrays?)
McCain responded by saying, &amp;ldquo;I have news for Senator Obama, al Qaeda is in Iraq, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re fighting in Iraq.</description>

The right (myself included) knew damn well what the left media were up to: influence voters to pick the weakest, viable Republican candidate.
They&amp;rsquo;ve done it.
McCain was the &amp;ldquo;media darling&amp;rdquo; candidate only until all other candidates fell out. That fall out came with this week&amp;rsquo;s primaries. Today, the very media that built up McCain and propelled him to the Republican nomination tore him down.</description>

I thought it was just me. Here in St. Louis, we&amp;rsquo;ve had a few way above average temp days this winter, including 70+ in January and February. But between those balmy days are many, many below average days and nights. My gas bill has been in over $200 a month, and I live in an 11-year-old, well insulated home.

      <description>The New York Times on Tuesday will carry story describing the Hillary Clinton campaign as a death-watch (h/t Drudge).
It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that on January 7, I wrote the Kerry campaign obituary prematurely. Still, the problems Hillary faces are of the sort that spells doom to candidates, either in their nomination quest or, later, in the general election. Shuffling top staff, borrowing money from the candidate, asking staff to work without pay are all symptoms of a campaign in deep trouble.</description>

      <description>Imagine the affect on Allied troop morale, planning, and espionage had US troops found Hitler&amp;rsquo;s diary during the Normandy invasion.
Something close, in the strategic sense, happened recently in Iraq. US fighters seized the diary of an al Qaeda in Iraq leader. The journal provides our side with names of terrorists, descriptions of their tactics, evidence of their atrocities, and catalogs of their weapons.
Just as important, though, the book proves that we are winning and the terrorists are losing.</description>

      <description>Eight years from now, the next Republican President will be running for re-election.

      <description>I just sent a copy of &amp;ldquo;Hard Corps: From Gangster to Marine Hero&amp;rdquo; to Berkeley, California, Mayor Tom Bates. After all the anger directed at Berkeley after its city council voted to declare our great Marines persona non grata, I figured, &amp;ldquo;Maybe these people are just ignorant.&amp;rdquo;
So I&amp;rsquo;m teaching the mayor to read, and what. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to educate other members of the council, find their names and addresses here.</description>

BOOOOOring!
Well, Reagan in 1980 was pretty cool. Since then, I don&amp;rsquo;t even want to hear MY candidate&amp;rsquo;s speech, much less the others. I mixed a Scotch and air and Obama&amp;rsquo;s still talking.</description>

      <description>Not entirely my fault.
I planned to vote on my way home from work. I have a client-facing job, and I have to respond to production issues. Tonight&amp;rsquo;s issue lasted until 6:10. Then, either local flooding or a bad accident had a major road to my house closed. It took over 45 minutes to get through the detour. By that time, it was 7:00 p.m., and my polling place in Ellisville, Missouri, was closed.</description>

      <description>We all know the trouble when a people, however recently formed, lose their homeland. Even if given privileged guest status in another country, they tend to make trouble for everyone around. (Think Palestinians.)
The Taliban continue to wage war against freedom in Afghanistan. Likewise, the vile people of Berkeley, California, wish to be free of the burdens of freedom. I have the solution:
Cede Berkeley, California, to the Taliban.
Radical Islamists would love the location and the accomodating people.</description>

      <description>Bill Clinton is famously jealous, selfish, petulant, and subversive. He and Hillary haven&amp;rsquo;t really lived as husband and wife in over a decade. Bill&amp;rsquo;s eight years in the White Houseleft a void where most presidents leave a legacy. He&amp;rsquo;s best known as the president who turned the evening news rating from TV13 to TV-MA.
In recent weeks, he&amp;rsquo;s angered Democrats and liberals by claiming, in so many words, that only black people are stupid enough to vote for Obama.</description>

      <description>Democrat presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, seen here explaining to an African-American toddler why black men should not be president, had her sinuses cleared by fellow Senator, Barack Obama, in the South Carolina primary on Saturday.
Clinton, once considered the inevitable nominee, appears weak and wounded headed into the February 5 Super Tuesday primaries.
The final numbers from South Carolina are staggering: Obama 55 percent, Clinton 27 percent, Edwards 18 percent.</description>

      <description>After Democrat leaders, Barack Obama, and Newsweek pointed out that former President Bill Clinton&amp;rsquo;s behavior has been un-Presidential, self-serving, and full of lies, Bill Clinton became more prideful and more petulant than ever.
I am amazed at the depths of Bill Clinton&amp;rsquo;s abhorrent behavior, but I&amp;rsquo;m equally amazed at Democrats&amp;rsquo; shock that their former hero is a bore.
Former Senate minority leader, Tom &amp;ldquo;Puff&amp;rdquo; Daschle called Clinton&amp;rsquo;s behavior &amp;ldquo;unpresidential.&amp;rdquo; Duh.</description>

      <description>Sorry, folks. I&amp;rsquo;m paying attention to the world in between client meetings. I have my most significant client in town.
I am heartbroken that Fred Thompson ended his race. I am discouraged that he had to end it. The only Reagan conservative&amp;ndash;well, Reagan-style conservative&amp;ndash;in the race is gone. My best to Fred and his family.
That leaves us with McCain (moderate) and Romney (smarmy).
And Obama (Jimmy Carter).
I&amp;rsquo;ll blog more tomorrow, but Carter&amp;rsquo;s presidency gave us Reagan.</description>

      <description>America, and the world, could be looking at the worst recession since the &amp;rsquo;70s and early &amp;rsquo;80s. (Coincidentally, the last recession began simultaneously with the end of an 8 year presidency. The one before that was pretty close, too.) I remember that era.
Only the unions and the remnants of employer-worker loyalty saved my neighbors from prolonged unemployment and foreclosure. St. Louis firms tried hard to keep their doors open. We know it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so good in other industrial cities: Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Milwaukee, southern Pennsylvania.</description>

      <description>In an interview certain to shock Democrats who believe Bill Clinton a paragon of truthfulness and honesty, Democrat candidate Barack Obama has accused Bill Clinton of lying, according to ABC News.
 &amp;ldquo;You know the former president, who I think all of us have a lot of regard for, has taken his advocacy on behalf of his wife to a level that I think is pretty troubling,&amp;rdquo; Obama said. &amp;ldquo;He continues to make statements that are not supported by the facts &amp;ndash; whether it&amp;rsquo;s about my record of opposition to the war in Iraq or our approach to organizing in Las Vegas.</description>

 &amp;ldquo;We went to Turkey. When we got over there, we rented a car and we drove all the way to Budapest. By the time we got to Budapest it was like the Cannes Film Festival, I&amp;rsquo;d never seen anything like it,&amp;rdquo; Theron told the Mail.</description>

      <description>With his third place finish in South Carolina, a lot of us are just waiting for the announcement from Fred Thompson that the race, for him, is over.
Charles Bird blogs on RedState that Thompson should do the honorable thing by dropping out and endorsing McCain. McCain, in turn, would return the favor naming Thompson his running mate if nominated.
 Thompson has enough support from social and economic conservatives to bring us a solid base going forward, especially if Thompson is a presumptive running mate.</description>

      <description>The polls in South Carolina closed 52 minutes ago, and ABC News projects that John McCain and Mike Huckebee will finish first and second (or second and first) with Fred Thompson battling Mitt Romney for third.
A third place finish could spell the end for Thompson and hopes for a conservative Republican candidate in 2008. A win for McCain could put the Arizona Senator and former POW on a wave that would carry him to the nomination&amp;ndash;and a brutal defeat in November.</description>

      <description>MSNBC projects Mitt Romney will win the Nevada Caucuses, topping Mike Huckabee, Fred Thompson, and Ron &amp;ldquo;Hell Yes I&amp;rsquo;m Nuts&amp;rdquo; Paul.
I have to admit, I paid absolutely no attention to recent polls in Nevada. South Carolina is where the action is, where my attention has been, and where my head and heart lie. South Carolina is where Fred Thompson, the conservative candidate for President, makes his stand.

      <description>The most recent three polls from South Carolina demonstrate one thing clearly: you can&amp;rsquo;t believe polls.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the latest from RealClearPolitics. The spreads and the leaders are so out of whack, so changing, that no one can draw any intelligent conclusions.
While McCain&amp;rsquo;s number is static at about 26, Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s numbers fluctuate wildly. Romney and Paul are steadily falling, while our hero Thompson rises steadily.
Let&amp;rsquo;s hope more Huckabee supporters break for Fred in the next 24 hours.</description>

 &amp;ldquo;Armed men entered the school in Beit Lahiya during the night and ransacked rooms as well as adminstration offices, and stole several computers.&amp;rdquo;
 Nasty fucks. I&amp;rsquo;ll bet George Soros finances this act of terrorism, too.
 The raid on the school was the second in a week. On Wednesday armed men fired anti-tank rockets at it, causing serious damage to the building.</description>

      <description>Anti-American billionaire George Soros would kill his own mother to make us believe he&amp;rsquo;s right. Then he&amp;rsquo;d pay millions to cover up his crime.
What other conclusion can we draw after learning, to no surprise, the Soros funded the fictitious Lancet report of 650,000 Iraqi deaths&amp;ndash;a report since dismissed by everyone from the DNC to the United Nations.
From London&amp;rsquo;s TimesOnline:
 A STUDY that claimed 650,000 people were killed as a result of the invasion of Iraq was partly funded by the antiwar billionaire George Soros.</description>

      <description>Al Qaeda in Canada, officially known as the Alberta Human Rights Commission, is persecuting Ezra Levant, former publisher of a magazine called The Western Standard, now defunct. His crime, according to the Commission, was publishing the famous Mohammed cartoons that originally appeared in a Danish Magazine.
Levant was ordered against his will to appear before the Commission on Friday, January 10. He began with a compelleing opening statement that made the Commission sound like a collection of Nazi boobs hellbent on destroying the right of political speech and to advance the cause of radical Islam in Canada.</description>

From the clip I blogged below, I have to give points to Romney for slamming Ron Paul. As a war hero, John McCain had every right to across the stage and belt that phony, lying, racist scum.</description>

      <description>Mitt Romney is pulling his broadcast advertising from South Carolina and Florida (h/t Drudge).
This could help Fred&amp;rsquo;s Fort Sumter strategy. I might have been wrong about Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s descent, as he seems to remain above 20 percent in key states. By conceding South Carolina, though, Romney may end up driving soft supporters to Thompson, and that might be his strategy.
With McCain, the media darling, rising, Romney could hope to bump up Thompson&amp;rsquo;s numbers in the Palmetto State.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not his biggest fan.
Yet Blackfive shows us a video that earns new admiration. He shows particular respect for the troops he is entertaining in Kuwait. He shows singular respect for military tradition. Finally, he shows due respect to his country and her colors.
Bravo, Mr. Williams.</description>

      <description>(Continued from &amp;ldquo;Change Is All You Need&amp;quot;)
**The Obama Years **
To be fair, Jimmy Carter inherited a country that needed a lot of work.
Lyndon Johnson&amp;rsquo;s Great Society programs, built on Roosevelt&amp;rsquo;s economically untenable New Deal welfare state, had set the nation&amp;rsquo;s economy and social classes on a path to destruction a decade earlier. The self-absorption of the Baby Boomers decayed the social institutions and mores that sustained us for 200 years.</description>

      <description>The Union Army held onto Fort Sumter for only day, but Fred Thompson hopes to gain and hold South Carolina from now to the convention.
Unlike other candidates who dodge, dip, dive, duck, and dodge better than Patches O&amp;rsquo;Houlihan when asked how far they&amp;rsquo;ll take their campaigns, Fred Thompson put it on the line tonight with his usual bold honesty:
 &amp;ldquo;This is where we make our stand - this is where I have chosen to make my stand,&amp;rdquo; Thompson told a crowd at a barbecue restaurant.</description>

But the children, like Oprah, croon.
Why do I say this? How am I qualified to say, as I did on Saturday, that four years of Obama will look much like the four years of Carter?</description>

      <description>Many of you don&amp;rsquo;t remember 1984. I was a junior in college, campaigning for Reagan, on campus and off. For those of you who weren&amp;rsquo;t around then, I can tell that even gray, rainy days were brighter than than sunniest June sky had been in 1979.
Nothing expresses the change in America better than this classic. Brought to you by the Republicans.

      <description>After tonight&amp;rsquo;s 90 minutes with the Republicans, I can say without any fear of error whatsoever that Fred Dalton Thompson is the most qualified person in either party to run the United States of America. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:
 * Thompson understands the philosophical foundations on which this country was born and became the greatest nation on earth * Thompson&#39;s sense of humor is sharp, ready, and appropriate * Thompson&#39;s legal training and experience shines when it comes to framing the issue, such as &amp;quot;why not Barack Obama?</description>

      <description>Robert Novak (h/t Wizbang! Jim Addison) reveals today that Mitt Romney&amp;rsquo;s campaign released the phony story that Fred Thompson would withdraw and send his support to McCain. That may explain why it appeared Thompson and McCain singled out Romney for attacks in Saturday Night&amp;rsquo;s debate on ABC.
Addision is a bit skeptical of Novak&amp;rsquo;s conclusions, noting that Bob did not name a source. I suspected Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s campaign as the source, but Romney is also a possibility.</description>

      <description>Last night I had to log off as soon asthe GOP debate ended, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d log my impressions this morning.
The Good
Thompson, McCain, and Giuliani helped themselves in varying degrees. Captain Ed Morrissey seems to agree:
 Fred Thompson got Romney to admit he liked the &amp;ldquo;mandates that you want&amp;rdquo;. It seemed to me that Thompson and McCain won the foreign policy portion of the debate. Everyone got a chance to score a few points off of Ron Paul, who trotted out the same tired &amp;ldquo;terrorism is our fault&amp;rdquo; theme that he just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to surrender.</description>

      <description>What I got out of the debate:
Ron Paul looks like Jack Riley, the comedian who played Mr. Carlin on the Bob Newhart Show in the 1970s:

That, and Fred Thompson won hands down. Rudy and McCain (in that order) Placed and Showed.
OIL
7:40 &amp;ndash; Romney, with Fred&amp;rsquo;s help, says he&amp;rsquo;s against windfall profits tax.
7:39 &amp;ndash; Giuliani is right-on on energy, particularly new refineries and nuclear power plants.</description>

      <description>Former governor Mitt Romney has won the Wyoming Caucuses. Romney has 6 of the 12 delegates up for grabs. Two other delegates are split between Thompson and Duncan Hunter. With 4 delegates to be decided, that leaves Romney with a lock.
Nonetheless, if Thompson could pick up 3 of the remaining 4, it would be a banner day for the true conservative voice.
The Wyoming GOP has an Excel spreadsheet showing the candidate favored in each county.</description>

      <description>Today is the Wyoming Republican caucus. Unfortunately, I know no one from Wyoming, though I do have a few business acquaintances from Montana. My cousin Bob lived in Wyoming for a few years after college, from whence he hitch-hiked to St. Louis for the annual Hennessy St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day party at Uncle Jim&amp;rsquo;s. Since I have no one to appeal to directly, I hope some Wyomingites stumple upon my humble blog and decide to wander to their county convention and cast a vote for conservatism in the person of Fred Thompson.</description>

 Incredible.
Curt links to PoliGazette, which wrote:

      <description>Fred Thompson, who only a week ago was predicted to finish behind Ron Paul, roared into third place in the Iowa Caucuses, passing McCain and Giuliani. Huckabee and Romney finished one and two.
Because so many had written off Thompson, his third-place showing should bolster his campaign&amp;ndash;a campaign that seemed stuck in low gear until recently.
The sad news is the support for Huckabee, a &amp;ldquo;non-conservative&amp;rdquo; Baptist minister who played a populism card in Iowa, demagoguing the Christian Right to build big momentum headed into the caucuses.</description>

      <description>Just as Fred Thompson&amp;rsquo;s campaign started to take off, a loose conspiracy of MSM and bloggers seems determined to bring him down.
As I blogged last night, a single rumor on Control Congress, which seemed implausible, turned into a major story today&amp;ndash;the day of the Iowa Cauci.
Apparently, the anti-Thompson forces were spooked by his surge in the polls in Iowa and decided to employ one of the dirtiest tricks in politics: the withdrawal rumor.</description>

      <description>Control Congress carried a rumor, today, that appears to have no legs.
 I was watching the Morning Joe and they claim the rumor is out that if Thompson does badly in Iowa he may pull out and endorse McCain.
 Whether or not McCain or Thompson might, at campaign&amp;rsquo;s end, recommend their supporters to one or the other remains a possibility. But I seriously doubt this rumor came from inside Thompson&amp;rsquo;s campaign.</description>

      <description>There are reasons to believe that Fred Thompson&amp;rsquo;s campaign is surging in Iowa.
First, Zogby&amp;lsquo;s daily tracking poll finds Thompson in a tie for 3rd with McCain.
Second, a Des Moines Register poll concluded 12/30 saw Thompson&amp;rsquo;s numbers rise by 2 percentage points.
Third, strategic Vision, concluded 12/30, shows an up-tic for Thompson.
Fourth, pundits are taking notice of both the late surge and Thompson&amp;rsquo;s penchant for substance over glitz:</description>

      <description>Liberalism is cultural treason.
Past US wars have spawned heroes. Generations honored them. I came of age in the 1980s, but I was well aware of men like Audey Murphy, Ted Knight, Doolittle, Patton, the men of Iwo Jima, the Baton Death March. These great men shaped our understanding of what it means to be a man.
Liberalism, though, has robbed my sons of such heroes. At least, it&amp;rsquo;s made their task of learning about these heroes much more difficult.</description>

      <description>Mike Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s recent ascent through the polls is about to reverse itself. Looking through RealClearPolitics news stories and polls, I saw a pattern:
 * Huckabee says something stupid * Romney fires off attack ads on Huckabee * Huckabee makes something up that might not be true * Romney fires off attack ads on Huckabee * Huckabee attacks Romney&#39;s ads * Repeat until sick  Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that people in Iowa, New Hampshire, Michigan, and the Palmetto State are not sadists who pick a candidate based primarily upon his or her ability to insult and impugn opponents.</description>

Hillary Clinton, whose troubles with questions from the people are the stuff of political legend, is employing the reverse of this lawyer&amp;rsquo;s rule: don&amp;rsquo;t take questions if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a good answer.
As Riehl World View explains that Hillary&amp;rsquo;s take NO questions in an attempt to avoid further gaffes, like not knowing how many children her close, personal friend Benazir Bhutto had.</description>

      <description>I planned to get new brakes on my car and to rearrange the storage room in the basement with my week off between Christmas and New Year&amp;rsquo;s. Solitary tasks.
Yesterday, though, like many of you, I read about theBlog Burst for Fred Thompson. I linked to Captain&amp;rsquo;s Quarter&amp;rsquo;s (where I first read the story), then to Rick Moran and John Hawkins, who seem to have launched the effort. For the rest of the day, I found myself e-mailing friends and posting updates about the effort to raise enough money for Fred to run a commercial in Iowa lead up to the caucuses.</description>

      <description>[ ](https://www.fred08.com/PhotoGallery.aspx#)
The blog burst has put Fred back on the air in Iowa. From our friend, Sean Hackbarth, at Fred &amp;lsquo;08:
  Your efforts are working. “Substance” is now airing in Iowa. We’re only $87,398 away from making sure it stays running through the caucuses. If 2200 people give $40 we make our goal. That’s doable since our average contribution today has been over $70.This wide-open Republican race means anything can happen.</description>

      <description>Mark Steyn might have said it best
Benazir Bhutto&amp;rsquo;s return to Pakistan had a mad recklessness about it which give today&amp;rsquo;s events a horrible inevitability.
Were any of us surprised to hear the news today? An Islamofascist slug shot to death Benazir Bhutto then blew up, either of his own volition or remotely by his sponsors. (We&amp;rsquo;ve learned to not believe that all terrorism executors are volunteers.)
Pakistan is home to Usama bin Laden, al Qaeda&amp;rsquo;s central command, and the what remains of the Taliban.</description>

Track the progress here: Fred 08
YOU DID IT! THE BLOG BURST REACHED ITS GOAL
Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s too strong, but it&amp;rsquo;s true. Anyone who votes for a candidate because of his or her statements on current issues is a moron too intellectually lazy to consider the gravity of a vote for president. Moreover, &amp;ldquo;issues voters&amp;rdquo; are gullible and selfish egomaniacs too caught up in their own immediate wants to recognize a liar when he&amp;rsquo;s selling them snake oil.</description>

      <description>When Drudge devotes his middle column to the collapse of Congress under Democrat control, you know the Dems are in trouble.
Citing four hit pieces in major papers, including The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post (here and here), USA Today, and The Hill, the DrudgeReport does to Pelosi and Reid what no amount of Republican advertising could ever do; he proves that Democrats are unfit to run the government.
USA Today&amp;rsquo;s editorial eviscerates Democrats on the war.</description>

      <description>Has everyone missed the real story behind the National Intelligence Assessment of Iranian nukes?
Conservatives, like Rush Limbaugh and Michelle Malkin, are doing back-bends to convince us that Iran is still a nuclear threat. Fine. I won&amp;rsquo;t argue that point. But a much larger story here looms, and everyone is missing it.
Iran&amp;rsquo;s reported abandonment of it nuclear weapons drive coincides with the United States&amp;rsquo; invasion of Iraq!

      <description>National Review expresses surprise and thanks that one Republican candidate has actually released comprehensive policy plans to deal with today&amp;rsquo;s challenges. Even more amazing to NR is the content of those plans: Conservative.
That candidate is Fred Thompson, who leads the GOP in publishing specific ideas. Perhaps the reason other candidates don&amp;rsquo;t put their ideas onto paper is that they don&amp;rsquo;t have any. Or they know that conservatives won&amp;rsquo;t like them.</description>

Also, Hall of Record offers some intriguing charts comparing the oil price trends to recent crashes in tech stocks and the 1981-1986 world oil price collapse. As I said, &amp;ldquo;intriguing.&amp;rdquo;
And this from the Wall Street Journal:
 Early signs of an easing in global demand growth and swings by Wall Street traders are pushing oil away from the historic $100-a-barrel mark, at least for now.</description>

      <description>The next election loomed ominously upon the political horizon in November 1979. A decade of failed foreign policy, Soviet expansion, stagflation, gas and oil shortages, historically severe winters, soaring crime rates, marauding youth, sexual perversion, and unstable standards left the American people wondering, &amp;ldquo;What next?&amp;rdquo;
Next, of course, was the Iranian hostage crisis, which might well be called &amp;ldquo;the last straw.&amp;rdquo; Jimmy Carter and his Democrat party took the blame. The once proud term &amp;ldquo;liberalism&amp;rdquo; became profane.</description>

Unlike many others&amp;ndash;from WWII to Iraq and Afghanistan&amp;ndash;I am physically unscathed and mentally better off than I was in November 1984. That&amp;rsquo;s when I left St. Louis MEPS for Navy Recruit Training Center, Orlando. Military life is military, but the submarine force ain&amp;rsquo;t bad duty, if you can get it. I got it. The Cold War was fun &amp;ndash; sort of.</description>

Banks are run by stupid, short-sighted people. They brought the current mortgage crisis, quickly turning into a general credit problem, upon themselves. They will wise up just in time to make us pay for their mistakes, but you already knew that.

Apparently, I was wrong:

Among high school students, Obama trounced second-place candidate Hillary Clinton 62 percent to 14 percent. The mentally ill, including schizophrenics and victims of head trauma, gave Barack a slight advantage over Democrat Dennis Kucinich 34 to 32 with Joe Biden of Maryland finishing a close third.</description>

      <description>In a story out of Geneva, today, the United Nations reports that US workers are the most productive in the world, both hourly and annually. That&amp;rsquo;s no surprise, except to Democrats who like to paint Americans as the scum of the earth.
The hours that we work are a bit off-putting, though.
 The U.S. employee put in an average 1,804 hours of work in 2006, the report said. That compared with 1,407.</description>

      <description>The MSM are tripping over themselves to publish stories about Fred Thompson&amp;rsquo;s supposed laziness. Newsweek decided to make the accusation head on (from CNN.com):
 [A]s he prepares to formally begin his campaign for the White House this week, after months of &amp;ldquo;testing the waters,&amp;rdquo; the conventional wisdom in Washington is that Thompson doesn&amp;rsquo;t want it badly enough, isn&amp;rsquo;t willing to work hard enough-put bluntly, that he is lazy.

      <description>As I predicted last week, the Democrats have hired the Associated Press to make up stories that discredit the success of the surge.
Last week, as good new about the surge was cresting, the AP treated as fact an opinion piece that the &amp;ldquo;body count&amp;rdquo; in Iraq had doubled since the surge began.
Today, AP customers are leading with another AP opinion piece claiming that August was one of the bloodiest months since the Iraq war began.</description>

      <description>Since July, I have been saying that the surge is working because America is on offense instead of hunkering down on defense. Captain&amp;rsquo;s Quarters found a Petraeus interview in which the HMFIC in Iraq confirms that it&amp;rsquo;s not just the numbers, it&amp;rsquo;s the attitude:
 How have things changed in Iraq? Petraeus compared the previous condition of Ramadi to Stalingrad. The general told the newspaper that having to stay on defense had taken its toll on American strength and had emboldened the enemy.</description>

      <description>I guess this makes it semi-official. Fred Thompson will announce his candidacy for President of the United States by WWW on September 6.
Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging for Fred since there were only about a dozen and a half bloggers for Fred. All I&amp;rsquo;m saying is that, when he&amp;rsquo;s trying to fill his Cabinet . . .
I expect his official entry to change the dynamics of the GOP race dramatically.</description>

      <description>You can&amp;rsquo;t beat the truth, folks.
Environmentalist Bette Midler (who, I think, is related to Barbara Streisand) faces state charges in Hawaii for illegally killing more than 200 trees on her estate.  The staff of the Board of Land and Natural Resources recommended $6,500 in fines for having the trees felled and for building a graded road without permits required for the land zoned for conservation use.
 Of course, she had the trees clear-cut in order to improve the environment, or so her publicist claims.</description>

      <description>A Democrat apparatchik named Lane Hudson has filed a complaint against Fred Thompson with the Federal Election Commission, according to WaPo.
The lefty claims that Thompson is violating the law by operating like a candidate without declaring his candidacy. Hudson plans to file similar complaints against George Washington, who spent much of the Revolutionary War traveling through critical electoral states, like Pennsylvannia and New York, without declaring himself a candidate for President.</description>

That said, Fred Thompson spoke to CNN yesterday, and his remarks make interesting reading.</description>

      <description>Catholic Bishop Tiny Muskens (make your own joke) says all Christians should refer to God only as &amp;ldquo;Allah.&amp;rdquo; The Dutch bishop believes that surrendering to the Muslims is in the best interest of Christianity.
Thanks, but no thanks, Your Excellency. Instead of that, how about if we call you &amp;ldquo;de-frocked&amp;rdquo; Bishop?
According to CWN:
 The Dutch bishop admitted that his suggestion was not likely to gain widespread acceptance. But he predicted that within a century or two, Dutch Catholics would be addressing prayers to &amp;ldquo;Allah.</description>

Instead, let&amp;rsquo;s say the numbers are correct and Fred Thompson is fading fast. Two questions come up: Why? and What of it?
Why: Interest in Thompson as the non-candidate peaked in late June and the first week of July.</description>

      <description>The incestuous relationship between the Democrat party and the MSM may be the Dem&amp;rsquo;s weakest link.
Big media are good two things: creating celebrities and destroying them. Think of Cindy Sheehan, Michael Jackson, Howard Dean. The evening news, the New York Times and Washington Post, the entertainment columns and television shows all contributed mightily to the rise and fall of these celebrities.
When Barack Obama threw into the presidential race, the media provided millions of dollars in free advertising.</description>

      <description>A NASA Goddard scientist says that the massive thunderstorm&amp;ndash;complete with tornado&amp;ndash;that struck New York City on Wednesday was not the result of global warming.
In a FoxNews.com article, James Hansen explains that the storm cannot be blamed on climate change, but it can be attributed to human activity.
Cities, it seems, make storms worse. Tall buildings direct wind upward, intensifying the storms. City heat islands, like warm ocean water to a hurricane, fuel storms.</description>

      <description>The only lasting impact of the Iowa straw poll will be the removal of Sam Brownback.
Brownback bussed in supporters by the bushel at $35 a head. He bet the farm on Iowa, and he lost. Mike Huckabee scored more votes than he paid for, which, as Time magazine points out, means one of two things: some of Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s supporters paid their own fare, or Huckabee stole votes from people who entered the fair on another candidate&amp;rsquo;s dime.</description>

Michelle Malkin does an outstanding job of breaking down the NASA Y2K error that sort of invented global warming.
In short, 1998 was NOT the hottest year of the 20th century. And half of the hottest years on record occured before WWII. Al Gore is an idiot, and now NASA scientists have proven it.
Earlier this week, the wackos got bad news from U of C San Diego and NASA who discovered that aerosols do not mask atmospheric warming but accelerate it.</description>

      <description>The Charleston terrorist story that began last Saturday has not been resolved, but the networks, dailies, and news magazines are keeping it hush-hush. Why? Are they cooperating with the feds in a larger investigation? Or did the DNC or one of the Democrat campaigns ask the media to bury the story? Or do the MSM no longer consider terrorism in the United States newsworthy?

Their attorney assures us that a) they have a really good reason for possessing pipe bombs, and b) the two Middle Eastern men with pipe bombs near a Navy base are victims of racial profiling. Whatever. Profile away.
   Before details about the pipe bombs were released, the executive director of a civil rights organization for Muslims in Tampa criticized the arrest as racial profiling, an accusation South Carolina police denied.</description>

      <description>For years, global warming alarmists have claimed that aerosols have masked the effects of greenhouse gases in the past, explaining why global temperatures cooled during a period of rapid greenhouse gas production in the 20th century.
But a new study by University of California-San Diego and NASA (found on FoxNews.com) indicates that the alarmists were wrong about the aerosols: they don&amp;rsquo;t reduce temperature but raise it. In other words, the things that wackos claim to reduce global warming actually cause global warming.</description>

 The Berkeley County Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s Office believes that among materials in the car&amp;rsquo;s trunk were a bomb and bomb making materials that include chemicals, fuses, and igniters. The men 21-year-old Yousef Megahed and 24-year-old Ahmed Mohamed were pulled over Saturday evening during a routine traffic stop near Myers Road and Highway 176.</description>

 I know . . . out of context, read the whole thing, and all that. Still, a guy running for president ought to know that praising Hezbollah is a good way to become a really, really difficult trivia question about people who ran for president in 2008.</description>

      <description>Last night in the U.S. House of Representatives, a party&amp;rsquo;s leadership refused to abide by a legal vote (Volunteer Opinion Journal).
The vote was on a Republican measure to strip from a farm bill language that guaranteed welfare for illegal aliens. The vote was 215-213 in favor of stripping the guarantees.
But Nancy Pelosi wanted a different result. So, her minions essentially burned the ballots, declared there was no vote, and ordered a new one (Michelle Malkin).</description>

      <description>The latest Rasmussen poll of likely primary voters completed July 31 shows Fred Thompson in front:
 In the race for the **Republican Presidential nomination, **former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson remains nominally on top with support from 26% of Likely Republican Primary voters. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani remains essentially even as the top choice for 24%. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and Arizona Senator John McCain are each preferred by 12% (see daily history).</description>

      <description>Thompson&amp;rsquo;s enemies in both parties&amp;ndash;all Democrats and the Republicans running for President&amp;ndash;are acting like the $3 million raised by his exploratory committee in June dooms his candidacy.
Nonesense.
First, Fred formed the committee on June 4. It takes a while to get the money flow started, to get people going to the websites, etc. If the average daily gross for June 24 - June 30 were no greater than that of the first week, I&amp;rsquo;d be more concerned.</description>

      <description>Not much time tonight . . . watching a movie with the family
Chuck Schumer&amp;rsquo;s an Idiot: Over the weekend, Chuck Schumer (see Malkin) picked up the theme started by Republican Sentator Arlen Specter. The two Senators are looking to indict Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts and Associate Justice Samuel Alito on perjury charges.
Schumer&amp;rsquo;s justification for effectively abolishing the Supreme Court is the so anti-historical and anti-Constitutional it&amp;rsquo;s almost funny.</description>

      <description>The Gateway Pundit (which you should read every day) discusses a Debka File report claiming the US sank a North Korean ship bound for Iran carrying nuclear weapon making cargo.
Debka is notorious for reporting stories that are, well, stories that aren&amp;rsquo;t true. But such a heavy-handed action by the US could explain North Korea&amp;rsquo;s recent cooperation on the nuclear front. We&amp;rsquo;ll keep our eye&amp;rsquo;s peeled.</description>

      <description>For years, now, al Qaeda and Taliban criminals have used the Western mountains of Pakistan as their home base. Emboldened by Pakistani President Musharraf&amp;rsquo;s reluctance to deal with radical Islam head-on, the Taliban have recently begun a campaign to turn Pakistan into what Afghanistan was before 9/11.
Ed Morrissey had been keeping up with these events, and this story today on Captain&amp;rsquo;s Quarters may signal the end to Musharraf&amp;rsquo;s patience with the radicals.</description>

      <description>Imagine you live on a busy street, and you have small children. You want to get a stop sign put up on one of the cross streets near your house to slow people down. You just need to know whom to talk to.
In a country like the United States where federalism has been replaced by Big Government, you probably need to get hold of your U. S. Congressman. If he&amp;rsquo;s so inclined, he&amp;rsquo;ll attach an amendment that authorizes the placement of the stop sign to some bill.</description>

Those of us whose conservative conversions occured in the late 1970s and early 1980s, I think, are particularly fascinated by the 10th Amendment to the Constitution. We also mourn over its senseless destruction by Congress, courts, and citizens.

      <description>Five kids is a lot these days. &amp;ldquo;You have five kids? Oh, my God!&amp;rdquo; people say, their eyes bugged out, mouths wide open.
Even when the oldest were babies, developmental psychologists were advising parent not to tell children &amp;ldquo;no.&amp;rdquo; Their theory was that &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; would teach a child limitation and destroy his curiosity. Instead, offer an alternative. Well, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. But the funny thing is, it&amp;rsquo;s the no &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; advice is totally out of synch with society.</description>

      <description>Matt Margolis at GOP Bloggers questions the cutting-edginess of the YouTube debate. He&amp;rsquo;s right in his various points about the ordinariness of the whole affair.
To make the presidential race more interesting, I propose a blog-off. The candidates have to start a blog using a commonly available blog app: WordPress (my fave), MoveableType, etc. The candidate with the highest TLB Ecosystem score wins his party&amp;rsquo;s nomination.
The rules
 1. Posts must be submitted by the candidate himself or herself.</description>

      <description>Michelle Malkin responds to that unnecessary race of humans known as liberals. The liberals, it seems, have gone about calling her web site, michellemalkin.com, a &amp;ldquo;hate-site.&amp;rdquo;
Other bloggers are jumping in to defend Michelle. I won&amp;rsquo;t. I think she has one of the best blogs in the business, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t need my defense.
First, liberals are evil little creatures&amp;ndash;more little than evil, in the small, petty sense. Their self-righteous slander is not really meant to hurt its target as to aggrandize the speaker or writer in his own small mind and among his own petty peers.</description>

      <description>Boston.com reports that social conservatives are &amp;ldquo;coalescing&amp;rdquo; around Fred Thompson as their choice for Republican nominee for President in 2008.
 &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a consensus developing around him that&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear and pretty profound,&amp;rdquo; said John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, an Orlando-based conservative group. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anything like it in 25 years in politics.&amp;rdquo;
 I agree. In 1979, as a high school sophomore with a National Review subscription, I became dissatisfied (for a short time) with the GOP.</description>

      <description>St. Louis, MO &amp;ndash; The Washington Post is reporting that former U. S. Senator and presumed Republican candidate (nominee?) for President, Fred Thompson, may have practiced law during a period of his life when he was out of office, according to sources inside BlogsForFredThompson.com.
The speculation is based on discoveries of Fred Thompson&amp;rsquo;s signature and name on court briefs in various Washington, DC. One of the briefs&amp;ndash;a &amp;ldquo;friend of the court&amp;rdquo; brief&amp;ndash; from August 1981 argues that citizens cannot be arrested for activities that are not against the law.</description>

      <description>Al Gore said this would be the worst year for hurricanes since hurricaning began, in 1952.
Matt Margolis, who does great research, has the answer.
 The 2007 hurricane season may be less severe than forecast due to cooler-than-expected water temperatures in the tropical Atlantic, private forecaster WSI Corp said on Tuesday.
 Just not enough global warming. The Gores&amp;rsquo;ll have to kick out a lot more CO2 in 2008. See Matt&amp;rsquo;s piece for the whole story.</description>

      <description>THIS IS HENNESSY&amp;rsquo;S VIEW&amp;rsquo;S 1000TH POST SINCE AUGUST, 2000
As an act of courtesy to the politics-weary American public, Fred Thompson is likely to announce his candidacy for the GOP nomination for President in September, according to columnist-reporterRobert Novak.
Thompson&amp;rsquo;s late entry may reverse a trend in recent years in which the next presidential campaign begins before the last one ends. If Thompson believes the people will be sick of Giuliani, Clinton, and Obama by the time the Super Bowl comes around, he may be right.</description>

Democrats in the House and Senate voted to encourage criminal prosecution of Americans who report suspicious activity (Gateway Pundit). Do you know how difficult it is to formulate a more dramatic representation of that fact than the fact itself (Discerning Texan)?
I hate Democrats. Yeah, I know, you&amp;rsquo;re not supposed to &amp;ldquo;hate&amp;rdquo; anyone. But Democrats are anti-American ass hats. They breed socialism.</description>

Gateway Pundit compares the most recent video (in which bin Laden appears for less than a minute) with a video from 2002. The background and bin Laden&amp;rsquo;s attire are identical. And doesn&amp;rsquo;t look so hot.
If this is not a new taping, then it could be an attempt by al-Qaeda to hide the terrorist&amp;rsquo;s death.</description>

      <description>A Rasmussen poll released on Friday shows Fred Thompson, not yet declared candidate, in a virtual tie with Rudy Guiliani as McCain continues his free-fall. I know a lot of his supporters want Fred to declare soon, but I think his strategy is working. As the left and the right throw all the negatives they can find his way, his poll numbers continue to climb. Perhaps he&amp;rsquo;s letting his opponents punch themselves out .</description>

      <description>For the past 4 years, Russian dictator Putin has moved his country closer and closer to its pre-Yeltsin isolation. Today, he announced suspension of NATO inspections of nuclear missile sites.
 Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree freezing participation in the treaty that cited &amp;ldquo;extraordinary circumstances &amp;hellip; that affect the security of the Russian Federation and require immediate measures,&amp;rdquo; the Kremlin said in a statement.
 Meanwhile, Russia continues a military build-up which most Americans have ignored.</description>

The load process replaced a lot of single and double quotes with some annoying ASCII character, but I&amp;rsquo;m not in the mood to clean it up right now, if you want to know the truth.

      <description>This won&amp;rsquo;t take long, but go get a beer. I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.
Okay, here&amp;rsquo;s why Thompson will probably be the next POTUS. Personality.
We like to think we vote for intellectual reason, but we don&amp;rsquo;t. Ask any sales professional how people buy, and the answer will be, &amp;ldquo;people buy on emotion and justify on reason.&amp;rdquo; Voting is the same.
Heard of buyer&amp;rsquo;s remorse? It happens when the (emotional) rush of buying fades and you&amp;rsquo;re left with only your intellect to defend the purchase.</description>

From the opening flag-burning to the end-of-evening driving arrangements, the party of defeat has thought of everything.
Mark has formatted the schedule for convenient printing and laminating. Be sure to share it with your friends.

It&amp;rsquo;s been around since before the term &amp;ldquo;web log&amp;rdquo; was coined. But I moved my hosting earlier in the year, and loading posts dating back to the Clinton administration ain&amp;rsquo;t no easy task for a man my age.

With a quote that perfectly demonstrates the liberal idea of freedom (thanks to Michelle Malkin) Cindy &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s about me&amp;rdquo; Sheehan has declared she intends to take Nancy Pelosi&amp;rsquo;s seat in Congress in 2008.
 I have a dream of the detention centers that George has built…filled with Orange Clad neo-cons and neo-connettes

In 1996, I quit writing my Town Hall column because I was sick of party politics. Specifically, I was sick of the GOP running losers because it was their turn.

      <description>Maybe it was the times.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s—even after 9/11—the people I worked with were friends. We socialized after work, attended each other’s weddings, and held heart-felt happy hours for our friends who left the company, voluntarily or not, to pursue “other opportunities,” as the official e-mail usually read.
Those were happy times. The telecommunications sector of technology where I worked at the time was shedding jobs like a German Shepherd drops hair in Spring.</description>

They don’t take my story well. After all, the whole idea of many web applications is configurability. By that I mean that a non-programmer can change, add, or remove values that cause either business rules, workflows, navigation flows, or content of a web site to change.</description>

Â What do liberalsâthose self-proclaimed guardians of tolerance and free speechâdo when a judge speaks the truth about the modern liberal idea of tolerance?
They call for his head on a pike, of course, but modern liberals tolerate only other modern liberals.</description>

      <description>Most of my life, Democrats ran Congress . . . the way Hitler ran Germany.Â Then in 1995, Newt Gingrich took the gavel.Â I had to learn a whole new perspective.Â I had to pick and choose what I was for and against, and I had to cut back on the Congress jokes.
The only good thing about the current balance of power, in my book, is that we can safely oppose everything Congress does or tries to do with absolute confidence that our position is the correct one.</description>

      <description>Interesting story on Foxnews.com.
We all learned in grade school that the &amp;ldquo;original&amp;rdquo; Americans were those who came across the Bering Straights about 3,000 years ago. They migrated from present day Alaska to Canada, the US, Central and South America. Then the white man came from Europe, spread disease and pestilence, herded them into corrals known as reservations, raped the women and cattle, killed all the bison, cut down the pristine forests, and placed onerous taxes on all that was left standing.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s hope Ted Kennedy&amp;rsquo;s theological insights make to the Vatican before the Pope writes his homily for Midnight Mass. We&amp;rsquo;d hate to mis-catechize the Christian world by talking about Jesus when Christmas is really about hourly wages, health insurance, and campaign contributions from unions.</description>

      <description>Stanley &amp;ldquo;Tookie&amp;rdquo; Williams lived a wasted life. He chose, at an early age, to kill for money, to sell drugs, to destroy families (including his own), and to make life for others as miserable as he&amp;rsquo;d made his own. He founded a street gang and supervised its stretch from Los Angeles to almost every major city in the US. With the help of a fawning press and Hollywood, murdering for kicks in the Tookie Williams style became as glamorous as murdering for politics did with the Black Panthers.</description>

      <description>Anti-Religion Religion professor, Paul Mirecki, has retained a lawyer to investigate the possibility of suing the University of Kansas for denying him rights under the First Amendment. A Law Professor reviews the possiblities for Mirecki and KU. Paul M. Secunda, an associate professor of law at University of Mississippi says Mirecki might have a difficult time building a case against KU.
 From a public employment standpoint, Mirecki would not seem to have a procedural due process claim against Kansas, as public employees are not seen as having a property interest in administrative positions such as the chairmanship of the department as opposed to having such interests in their professorial positions.</description>

Meanwhile, Douglas County Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s office has seized Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s car and computer as part of its investigation into Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s alleged beating. Says Mirecki, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m being treated more like a criminal than a victim.</description>

      <description>I received an e-mail from NewsMax today about the Disney film &amp;ldquo;Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.&amp;rdquo; It contained warnings from variously striped Christians that the movie may not be true to the Christian intentions of C. S. Lewis.
Included in the e-mail was a quote from the film&amp;rsquo;s producer, Mark Johnson: &amp;ldquo;When I read the book as a child, I accepted it as a pure adventure story.</description>

      <description>The Topeka Capital-Journal  (free registration required) online has a piece that exposes Professor Paul Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s anti-religion intolerance. While I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to say his &amp;ldquo;beating&amp;rdquo; was a hoax, after reading more about the case since getting home from work, one could make the case that Mirecki used some injury as an opportunity to strike back at those he perceived to be attacking him: Christians and the media.
Consider the depth of Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s intolerance and the leading university response to Mirecki:</description>

MOONBAT BLOG UPDATE: Representative of the kind of knee-jerk jumping to prejudiced conclusions that liberals and the &amp;ldquo;educated&amp;rdquo; are famous for, someone named Elaine Meinel Supkis  (who claims 100% personal responsibility for turning Pope Benedict XVI into a &amp;lsquo;conservative&amp;rsquo;) ignored all of the known facts of Paul Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s alleged and highly doubtable beating story:</description>

      <description>Michelle Malkin has done great digging and found more holes in Prof. Paul Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s (see this and this) beating story than in Howard Dean&amp;rsquo;s brain.
For instance, Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s description of injuries do not match the hospitals. The police report gives very little evidence. Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s claim, that he got out of his truck to confront two yahoos who were crowding him makes little sense UNLESS Mirecki is the kind of guy who likes to settle things with his fists (which would greatly increase my respect for the guy).</description>

      <description>Okay, I can&amp;rsquo;t claim credit for this research. Jack Cashill earns the kudos for his December 1 commentary on WorldNetDaily. As with pro-terrorist professor Ward Churchill, Mirecki has a long paper trail of opposing those with faith, particularly Catholics and Jews. Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt from Cashill&amp;rsquo;s outstanding piece.
  In response to a SOMA communicant outraged that students were distributing free Bibles on campus, Mirecki told of how he had conceived an &amp;ldquo;anti-Bible tract&amp;rdquo; to counter the Christian presence.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Hi. I&amp;rsquo;m Paul Mirecki. I hate God and everyone who prays to Him.&amp;rdquo;
According to Fox News, a University of Kansas professor who created a class designed to attack Christianity and Intelligent Design theories was beaten by a couple of thugs yesterday.
 Last week, Mirecki asked the university to cancel the class after he created a furor by sending an e-mail to a student organization mocking Christian fundamentalists.
 Mirecki had referred to religious conservatives as &amp;ldquo;fundies,&amp;rdquo; and said a course describing intelligent design as mythology would be a &amp;ldquo;nice slap in their big fat face.</description>

      <description>Yes, there are many other things to write about. My move to Ballwin, Missouri has interrupted both my observations of the world at large and my commenting on them. Still, a singularly inspiring photo caught my eye: The evil, hate-mongering Benedict XVI plays nice with the new Palestinian leader. When I was a cynical young man, I&amp;rsquo;d have made good humor about this. Today, though, and only by God&amp;rsquo;s beneficence, I see nothing but hope.</description>

      <description>One thing I like to do at work is to give my team members a bit of my perspective on things around holidays or significant events. Here&amp;rsquo;s my Thanksgiving message to the troops.
A wise man I once worked for, Tom Merta, had a simple yet profound view of life and work: You can get anything you want in life by helping enough other people get what they want.
When others demands seem overwhelming and pointless, when deadlines seem arbitrary, when commitments seem only burdens with no reward, I have to remind myself of the obvious simplicity of Toms motto.</description>

      <description>The recent attacks onMichelle Malkin are mere evidence of the theologically unassailable fact that Satan is to modern liberalism what the KGB was to SANE/Freeze. Of course, liberals don&amp;rsquo;t believe in Satan or God or Hell or Heaven. (If the road to hell be paved with good intentions, then hell&amp;rsquo;s bowels gurgle and belch with the dyspeptic cosmic waste of those who disbelieved in eternal punishment.)
And while those calling themselves &amp;ldquo;conservatives&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;of the right&amp;rdquo; resort to base name-calling and mudslinging, it is far worse, far more self-damning, when a liberal does it.</description>

      <description>The correlation between liberalism and selfishness is too easy to make. Atheistic liberalism gives selfishness a whole new dimension. But liberals, who in their selfishness consider themselves the epitome of compassion, say you can&amp;rsquo;t measure compassion.
I utterly refute that idiot sentiment. And it is nothing more than mere sentiment.
Via FoxNews.com, we learn that folks in liberal states spend their money almost exclusively on themselves, while &amp;ldquo;Bible belt&amp;rdquo; people spend money on those who need help.</description>

In an interview with Newsweek (on MSNBC.com), Rice says that her reconversion will be the sole focus of her future writing.
 In two weeks, Anne Rice, the chronicler of vampires, witches andunder the pseudonym A. N. Roquelaureof soft-core S&amp;amp;M encounters, will publish &amp;ldquo;Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt,&amp;rdquo; a novel about the 7-year-old Jesus, narrated by Christ himself.</description>

Go to Confession.
Learn Latin.
No, these are not only my preferences, these changes are coming soon to a Mass near you.
In the 4th General Congregation of the 11th General Synod of Catholic Bishops, today, the centrality of the Eucharist, the purpose of the Synod, was central to the discussion:
  Archbishop Jan Pawel Lenga M.I.C., from Karaganda, Kazakhstan, who was persecuted for his faith during the years of soviet communism, recalled the days when the Eucharist was forced to be celebrated in secret by the faithful.</description>

      <description>WASHINGTON, D.C., SEPT. 22, 2005 (Zenit.org).- The United States and the international community must do more to bring an end to the ongoing crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan, says a U.S. bishop. Bishop John Ricard, the chairman of the U.S. episcopate&amp;rsquo;s International Policy Committee, made that statement in urging support for a &amp;ldquo;National Day of Action for the People of Darfur.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;The crisis in Darfur must be ended,&amp;rdquo; said Bishop Ricard, of Pensacola-Tallahassee, in a statement.</description>

Before making landfall 6 hours earlier than currently projected, the hurricane will pick up speed to &amp;gt; 20 mph, weaken to &amp;lt; cat. 3 and make landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border as a mid-category 2.</description>

      <description>When I was a runner, I took part in many runs to support various charities. One I never joined was the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. Not because I oppose breast cancer research, but because something about that particular organization rubbed me the wrong way. For one thing, it seemed too big, too intrusive. It was like a charity version of the AFL-CIO, before it collapsed.

      <description>Shocking Coldness generated many responses from many quarters (for my blog, anyway). I have to admit, some of the criticism has forced me to think, while some of the arguments against my (assumed) position deserve a challenge.
First, the original post accurately reflects my opinion about attitudes displayed by the women in the NY Times story. Remember, please, that this is a web log, a journal of my personal opinion and reflection.</description>

      <description>How timely was Tom&amp;rsquo;s blog on the Latin Mass?
I just received this holy news from Karl Keating&amp;rsquo;s newsletter:
 Last Thursday Catholic World News transmitted this story, filed out of Dublin, regarding what might happen to what is commonly called the Tridentine Mass:
 &amp;ldquo;Pope Benedict XVI will take action soon to allow all Catholic priests to celebrate the Latin Mass, a Cambridge historian has predicted.
&amp;ldquo;Speaking to a conference of priests in Ireland earlier this week, Eamonn Duffy said that it was &amp;lsquo;extremely likely that Pope Benedict will lift the restrictions on the celebration of the Tridentine liturgy,&amp;rsquo; the Irish Independent reported.</description>

      <description>TheNew York Times Online, today, is drumming up sympathy for abortion.
 Venetia Grunder, 21, viewed an ultrasound image of the fetus in her womb. She was 12 weeks pregnant, though she had taken birth control pills as directed. &amp;ldquo;I feel pretty messed up,&amp;rdquo; she said after seeing the image. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s different, just knowing. My husband told me not to look. This changes my feelings, but I&amp;rsquo;m sticking by it. Damn it, $650, I&amp;rsquo;m sticking by it.</description>

      <description>Listening to Fr. Frank Pavone&amp;rsquo;s homily on EWTN&amp;rsquo;s daily Mass today, my mind wandered to the Roberts confirmation hearing. Well, not to Roberts&amp;rsquo;s, but to another Supreme Court nonimee&amp;rsquo;s: a nominee whose public statements on Roe vs. Wade tow the liberal line.
Chairman: The chair yields to the senior Senator from Missouri for ten minutes. Senator Bond.
Bond: Thank you Mr. Chairman, colleagues, Judge Smeal. (Sifting through notes) Judge Smeal, have you ever seen photos or diagrams of an abortion in progress?</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, men and women separated themselves from society in order to pray. Often, their piety attracted like-minded individuals to join them. Among early Christians, the practice became fairly common, and continued through the middle ages and even after the Reformation. While that may not be an official definition of monasticism, it fits.
One can only imagine that forming a new religious order was easier in the days of the great kings of Europe than it would be today.</description>

      <description>You see them. They&amp;rsquo;re knocking each other down to blame Katrina and its aftermath on Bush. They&amp;rsquo;re lying, of course. They&amp;rsquo;re Democrats; they can&amp;rsquo;t help themselves.
Genius isn&amp;rsquo;t required to see that the relief efforts in Republican-conrolled Mississippi, with far more storm damage than Louisiana, is relatively smooth. Like Florida&amp;rsquo;s Jeb Bush, Haley Barbour seems to know what he&amp;rsquo;s doing.
Next door in Louisiana, there&amp;rsquo;s another story. Democrat run, Democrat destroyed Louisiana is a shambles.</description>

      <description>The people at Planned Parenthood are the kinds of cowards who give cowardice a bad name.
Dawn Eden demonstrated, today, how Planned Parenthood tried to divert money for Katrina Relief into their own abortion mills. Now, if you&amp;rsquo;re eugenicist, racist, baby-killer like those who run and support and profit from Planned Parenthood, then the their logic will make sense:
 a) Most of the really, really brutalized victims of Katrina we saw on television were poor blacks; b) if there weren&amp;rsquo;t so darn many poor blacks, the hurricane&amp;rsquo;s effect would have been far less catastrophic; therefore, c) if we prevent poor blacks from breeding, we will avoid future Katrinas.</description>

      <description>A week ago yesterday, anticipating Katrinas arrival on the Gulf Coast, I penned the following paragraph on this blog:
 Perhaps we fortunate souls in the rest of the country should begin a ring of volunteers willing to put up a displaced person or family until they can get back on their feet. Im sure the government will help relocate folks. While St. Louis isnt exactly Louisiannas backyard, our door is open to such a family in need.</description>

      <description>With perhaps 10,000 dead in the Gulf Coast, it seems almost silly to talk about one man&amp;rsquo;s death. But the man who died first came to our attention with bushy sideburns, thick glasses, and wide lapels.
William Rehnquist was never a politician. He was just a judge. His devotion to the Constitution was amazing. He never deviated from his path of original understanding and legislsative intent. When Rehnquist authored an opinion, it was right in the eyes of the law, in the eyes of democracy, and in the eyes of God.</description>

      <description>Police looting for food. People starving to death. The first of the Red Cross aid arrived in Biloxi, Mississippi only tonight, four days after the hurricane. Scarborough says he&amp;rsquo;s been involved in many hurricane relief efforts, and he&amp;rsquo;s never seen one this unresponsive.
In New Orleans, there are very few Guardsmen, police, doctors visible. Several doctors left the Super Dome, unable to treat people because of the violence. One doctor reported the problem of the bodies of murder victims: four Wednesday night, four Tuesday, maybe more.</description>

      <description>The Department of Homeland Security just faced its first major test in New Orleans. It failed miserably.
No one is in charge. Looters, gangs, thugs, and murders rule the streets. (See Michelle Malkin: Can Law and Order Be Restored?) Police and other supposed officials have no instructions on what to do with refugees, who are herded from one street gang war to another. Days-old-babies are boiling in the sun while police yell at their helpless mothers to keep moving toward the danger zones.</description>

As a Christian, I believe that all love, charity, and kindness comes from God. But we have free will to pass it along or to use it all on ourselves. For that matter, we can reject it completely. Today&amp;rsquo;s response demonstrates the American people, at least many of them, are passing along God&amp;rsquo;s graces in buckets.</description>

The infant and her mother had been dropped off of a boat after being rescued from an attic with 12 other people. The baby was burning hot, and Smith had to flag down a police officer to get medical attention. Dramatically, the police and paramedics showed up while Smith was interviewing the people on the air.</description>

Victims will be overwhelmed with Americans&amp;rsquo; desire to help. I am confident that with time you&amp;rsquo;ll get your life back in order . . . the great city of New Orleans will be back on its feet.

I have been running Firefox on both Linux (SuSE&amp;rsquo;s latest) and Windows (XP Pro SP2) since beta days. With each release and each patch, I expect the uncountable list of problems to abate. Instead, the list grows only longer.
On Windows, Firefox has plenty of plug-ins, though not enough. It freezes constantly.</description>

      <description>In the continuing story of the resurgence of Roman Catholicism, Newsweek online reports on an orthodox Catholic frat at Franciscan University: Knights of the Holy Queen.
Many on the Catholic right have long argued the church&amp;rsquo;s decline began with Pope Paul&amp;rsquo;s misguided reform of the Holy Mass in 1968. During the 1970s, Catholic dioceses and parishes in the Western world purged their sanctuaries of Christ, the Crucifix, the Blessed Mother, God, prayer, reverence, and holiness, replacing these &amp;ldquo;relics&amp;rdquo; with worship of the profane, the creature, the created.</description>

      <description>I have a child who suffers from many neurological infirmities. He attends a prestigious school district in St. Louis County, Missouri. Several times, I have expressed my disappointment in the way some administrators in his former middle school, from which he has since matriculated, handled his problems.
For his privacy, I never referred to the child in question as my son. I never used his name. And for their privacy, I never named the administrators with whom I disagreed.</description>

      <description>Jay Anderson illuminates a blood-boiler involving Viacom and Mother Teresa. (The fact that so many anti-theists so despise a woman who did nothing but good her entire life should tell us a lot about these people.)
Penn and Teller aired a show in which they called Mother Teresa a &amp;ldquo;f*ing ct.&amp;rdquo; The Catholic League protested. Viacom promised to never air the episode again.
But Viacom&amp;rsquo;s president, Sumner Redstone, wanted the last word.</description>

      <description>C. S. Lewis makes a compelling argument that perfect love is perfect wisdom&amp;ndash;or knowledge or understanding. You&amp;rsquo;d have to read his whole thing, which I encourage you to do. (I think it&amp;rsquo;s from The Four Loves.) I firmly believe that, and have since I read it&amp;ndash;not that I doubt much of what Lewis wrote.
Futher, since God is love, then in God, and only in God, can we find love. Or is it Love?</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, I craved Holy Communion. Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind being the ONLY PERSON IN THE CHURCH who doesn&amp;rsquo;t go up to receive the true Body and Blood of our savior each mass. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m kind of proud of that. While there&amp;rsquo;s nothing honorable about being the only person in the church in a state of mortal sin (there&amp;rsquo;s hell to pay), but there is some honor, I think, in being the only one, at least at Daily Mass, to admit it.</description>

      <description>Safety.
Women want to feel safe. They seek out men who can protect them. Sorry, but it&amp;rsquo;s true.
When a woman feels that her man can no longer protect her or their children, she has no use for him. Humor, cooking, intellect, whatever other qualities he might have become meaningless. They were only perquisites stacked atop his primary attraction: safety.

      <description>The only liberator of women in history was Jesus Christ. Catholics are accused, falsely, of worshiping His mother, Mary. We venerate Mary. We ask His mother to pray for us, to intercede with Him on our behalf. We try to imitate her faith and obedience&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;Be it done unto me according to thy word.&amp;rdquo; And most of us usually fall way, way short.
When I read a poll showing that 2/3 of the adults in a Catholic church on any given Sunday are women, I was struck by the ratio.</description>

      <description>The Roman Catholic Episcopate is set to introduce sweeping changes to the Latin Rite liturgy during its General Synod, October 2 through October 23, 2005.
According to the agendum for the synod, which Catholics should read here, the following points will be addressed:
* Intensive catechesis on the importance of keeping the Holy Days of Obligation, particularly the Sunday requirement. * Dignity, due preparation, and faith in the mystery of the Eucharist * The secularization of salvation and religious relativism * Understanding that &amp;quot;participation&amp;quot; in the Mass centers on receiving the Body and Blood of Christ the Redeemer, not standing in the sanctuary with your hands in the air in imitation of a priest.</description>

First, I want to publicly thank Our Lady for her gracious intercession. I know that if my request is not opposed to God&amp;rsquo;s holy Will, it will be done.
Second, just in case, if you happen to be praying for things, please drop my name with the Almighty.</description>

Paul Krugman decided to maliciously call Alabama a state full of illiterates who needed pictures to understand a story. Thus, claims Krugman, Toyota had to build a new car plant in Canada&amp;ndash;Alabama lacked a literate workforce.</description>

Israeli intelligence reports that the large network of al-Qaeda web sites, the organizations primary means of international communication, have been taken out of service. The Israelis believe UK intelligence did the Lord&amp;rsquo;s work on this case, reports the Times of London.
 Over the past fortnight Israeli intelligence agents have noticed something distinctly odd happening on the internet. One by one, Al-Qaedas affiliated websites have vanished until only a handful remain, write Uzi Mahnaimi and Alex Pell.</description>

 BALLYMENA, NORTHERN IRELAND, Ireland, July 27 (CNA) - Tuesday saw what police have called a wave of intimidation attacks against Catholics in and around Ballymena, a mostly Protestant town northwest of Belfast.
 The Associated Press reported that Protestant extremists planted a homemade grenade outside a Catholic family&amp;rsquo;s home in Ballymena. The bomb detonated, causing minor damage. Arsonists badly damaged one Catholic-run pub in the village of Martinstown, and caused minor fire damage to the outside of another pub in nearby Rasharkin with two gasoline-filled bottles.</description>

Michelle Malkin has done a great job on this story, finding the loopholes in Franken&amp;rsquo;s loopholes.
Those of us who always assume the worst motives of limosine liberals are alway right. There&amp;rsquo;s a satisfying justice in that, like when we learned that Barbara Streisand believes people like her are exempt from the need to protect the environment, or when theDave Matthews Band illegally dumps human feces all over boaters in Chicago.</description>

He told the assembled that Christian churches in the West appear to be dying. In particular, the so-called mainline Protestant churches have been losing members for nearly a century.
Jay Anderson at Pro Ecclesia conjectures:
 &amp;ldquo;Mainstream churches&amp;rdquo; appear to be dying. Well, then, they aren&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo;, are they? Just like the dying &amp;ldquo;mainstream media&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo;.</description>

According to Michelle Malkin, Ed Morrissey, Brian Maloney, The Bronx News, and other sources, several federally supported relief agencies in New York have been illegally funelling hundreds of thousands of dollars to Al Franken&amp;rsquo;s anti-American radio network Air America.
The agencies in question, Gloria Wise Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club and Pathways for Youth Boys &amp;amp; Girls clubs.
 One source told the News that $480,000 in funds from the Gloria Wise Club is involved in the citys investigation of illegal transfer of funds from the local club.</description>

      <description>I wish I could give the details, but that would cause problems. Suffice it to say that two weeks ago, something my wife and I had been praying hard for seemed to have been placed out of reach. If that was God&amp;rsquo;s answer to our prayers, it was a resounding &amp;ldquo;Get lost.&amp;rdquo;
Thankfully, though, we didn&amp;rsquo;t stop. I went straight to the perpetual adoration chapel and knelt before the exposed Body of Christ for an hour and a half.</description>

      <description>No, really, of course. RomanCatholicBlog tells us at the the next time the Bishops get together, they might, just might, address the problem of horrible, rancid, loud, profane music at Mass.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure all those who have complained about the music weren&amp;rsquo;t inspired by my blog. More likely, they were inspired by the same Holy Ghost that inspired me.</description>

      <description>Since the beginning of the labor union movement, the greatest threat it felt&amp;ndash;often paranoically&amp;ndash;was management (or the Republicans) &amp;ldquo;breaking&amp;rdquo; the union. The external threat was seen to come from anti-union laws, movement of jobs overseas, and negotiating tactics that left union strikes powerless. Now, it seems, that the union movement may, like communism, collapse from its own weight.
After a steady 20+ year decline in union membership, the flagship of organized labor, the AFL-CIO, fractured this week, losing more than 1/3 of its membership.</description>

From Jay Anderson, via NewsMax, via NBC, we learn Durbin considers being pro-life as a disqualifying defect for any judge.
I wonder how many abortions his wife and children account for? After all, if abortions are such wonderful things, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t he want the women he loves have a few?</description>

      <description>My weekly attack on Catholic liturgical abuse needs some caveats:
* I accept the teaching of the Second Vatican Council as bound in heaven as on earth. * I accept the validity of the New Mass based on the church&#39;s Magisterium and the indefectability of the church. * I do not believe that people who attend (by choice) New Mass are living outside the faith.  A wedding this weekend left us no choice but to attend the 5:30 PM &amp;ldquo;LIFETeen&amp;rdquo; mass at our local parish.</description>

Pennsylvania Lt. Governor Catherine Baker Knoll is the sort of thing one scrapes from the bottom of a shoe. She crashed the funeral mass of fallen Marine Sgt. Joseph Goodrich to campaign for office and to chastise the family of the fallen hero, saying &amp;ldquo;our government opposes this war.&amp;rdquo;
 She sat down next to a Goodrich family member and, during the distribution of communion, said, &amp;ldquo;Who are you?</description>

It appears, now, the NCI is removing all copies of the study from the internet in a Soviet-style attempt to whitewash history. Still, pdf copies remain, and here is a link to one.

      <description>The Canadian Conference of Bishops bravely demanded that Catholics continue to resist Canada&amp;rsquo;s attempt to redifine marriage.
 Catholics are to continue to oppose it, and to ensure that all provincial and territorial regulations on the solemnization of marriages provide full protection for freedom of conscience and religion, as guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
 Meanwhile, in Spain, a judge, Laura Alabau, has refused to marry a lesbian couple and is appealing to that country&amp;rsquo;s high court to overturn the law.</description>

      <description>My first foray into editing Wikipedia happened when I found some really bad etymology of St. Peter&amp;rsquo;s name. Following the misteaching of some Protestant theology, a well-meaning soul had written that Christ Jesus gave Symon the name &amp;ldquo;Petros,&amp;rdquo; then turned to a rocky cliff and said, &amp;ldquo;And upon this petra I will build my church.&amp;rdquo; (Since my edits, though, the entry has been radically altered.)
Petros, in Greek, is a little rock.</description>

      <description>Now that Canada has made homosexual &amp;ldquo;marriage&amp;rdquo; the law of the land, it won&amp;rsquo;t be long before Catholic priests are imprisoned for refusing to preside over such blasphemy. Though Canadian Liberals assure us that the law applies specifically to &amp;ldquo;civil&amp;rdquo; marriages, there is no protection against civil suits against priests who refuse to conduct homosexual marriage ceremonies. And we all know how much liberals enjoy suing.
The good news is that the situation may provide an opportunity for Canadian martyrs, of which there are few.</description>

MSNBC reports that Tony Blair has appealed for calm. That seems superfluous in England where the good people showed such commendable fortitude after the last bombs.
Thanks to God, the human toll was much lower this time:
 Only one person was reported wounded in Thursday&amp;rsquo;s blasts, but Blair said the intention of the attacks must have been to kill.
 And one of the bombers, this time, may have survived the attack.</description>

Today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel helped me understand. Jesus wept for Jerusalem. They were so wrapped up in themselves that they could not recognize their Messiah when he stood before them. They turned God&amp;rsquo;s temple into a &amp;ldquo;den of thieves.&amp;rdquo; American Catholics have turned the New Jerusalem, the church Christ built with his blood and tears, into a den of thieves.</description>

I hope Pope Benedict&amp;rsquo;s roadmap will drive the likes of Fr. Richard McBrien to some church where he belongs. His snotty attack on conservatives deserves scorn from all corners of the Catholic church.
McBrien considers liberal Catholics mentally healthy, well-adjusted, and intelligent.</description>

In 2002, at the peak of the Cardinal Law Boston priest sex abuse scandal, Santorum passed at least some of the blame for the Boston church&amp;rsquo;s licentiousness on the prevailing &amp;ldquo;anything goes&amp;rdquo; attitude of Boston, its people, and its environs.</description>

      <description>St. Rita&amp;rsquo;s parents picked a husband for her when she as 15. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good choice, though. He beat her, gambled away their money, and carried on open affairs with other women. They had two children. Rita had wanted to enter the convent until her parents told her to marry this man.

Rita&amp;rsquo;s husband was mortally stabbed. He converted on his death bed, as did her two wayward sons who died shortly thereafter.</description>

      <description>The Satanic National Abortion Rights Action League (SNARAL) is now picketing crisis pregnancy centers to try to intimidate pregnant Christians into committing murder. No, I&amp;rsquo;m not kidding, and neither is the Dawn Patrol where my wife found this sickening story. Please read the entire blog and follow the excellent links. They will help contribute to pro-life organizations trying to counter SNARAL&amp;rsquo;s murderous designs.
One of these demons enjoins us to &amp;ldquo;See how beautiful we looked.</description>

      <description>Regular readers might expect me to rant against the AARP, as I at least monthly. But this time, their altruism is commendable.
By endorsing euthenasia for the elderly, the AARP has admitted that it serves no worthwhile purpose and must be put to sleep.
Certainly, just disbanding would be the moral thing to do. But if the AARP insists on disbanding by suicide, who am I to get their way?</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s one of Hitch&amp;rsquo;s reactions to the London Bombing:
 We know very well what the &amp;ldquo;grievances&amp;rdquo; of the jihadists are.
 The grievance of seeing unveiled women. The grievance of the existence, not of the State of Israel, but of the Jewish people. The grievance of the heresy of democracy, which impedes the imposition of sharia law. The grievance of a work of fiction written by an Indian living in London.</description>

 It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why people are seduced by Howard Dean. He&amp;rsquo;s well-spoken, handsome, and sensible. He appears to have a strong grasp on most major issues, a willingness to compromise with his opponents, and the gift of not getting flustered by minor annoyances.</description>

This afternoon I joined ProLifeBlogs.org and tonight, on that blog, I found the thrust of a theory the theological side of my brain has been pondering for some time (though it&amp;rsquo;s not time to expose it just yet):

Everyone who likes Michael Moore is an idiot. Okay, everyone except the anti-Americans who pretend to be idiots.
This week thanks to Moore&amp;rsquo;s al-Qaida heroes, he looked like a compete moron. Why? Because Moore claims terrorism is a red-herring, an invention. The Twin Towers? Computer graphics. If your husband disappeared on 9/11, it&amp;rsquo;s because he ran off with his secretary.</description>

      <description>According to Religious News Service and Christian News, Jewish satirical rapper, 50 Shekel, after viewing Mel Gibson&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Passion of the Christ&amp;rdquo; has accepted Christ Jesus as the Messiah.
 Messianic Jews, like Christians, believe that Jesus (or as they refer to him, Y&amp;rsquo;Shua) was the expected Messiah. Though they claim to be following the true Judaism, mainstream Jews are nearly unanimous in rejecting the idea that Messianic Jews are Jewish, and many believe them to be Christians intentionally targeting Jews for conversion.</description>

      <description>London Bombing Watching the news of the miserable murders in London, I am reminded, oddly, of the other Bombing of Britain. After weeks of torturous air raids on London and its suburbs, Nazi Germany surely thought that English stood on the brink of collapse.
But in the midst of the carnage, terror, and mayhem, Prime Minister Winston Churchill found the time to address the people of the United States. He encouraged us to keep a stiff upper lip.</description>

They worship lies, evil, disintegration, and ugliness. Sulfur is their perfume. Cancer is their aphrodesiac. Excrement is their fine art. And merciless murder of children is their unholy sacrament. Compared to members of NARAL, hardcore Nazis were alter boys.
Their latest attack on truth, beauty, good, and unity is their Screw Abstinence campaign.</description>

But they aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid of spening eternity burning in the fires of hell.
I pray the Holy spirit descends upon these pitiful souls. They are truly worthy of our most profound prayers. I pray for those United Church of Christ leaders who prefer the praise of Satan over the promises of Christ.</description>

      <description>Yeah, I know. But when a major news network (NBC) equates America&amp;rsquo;s Founders with Usama bin Laden and the only people to react are conservatives, maybe this great experiment in self-governance has failed.
It seems to me that the only remaining battle is The God Fearing vs. Everyone Else. If I have to die for something I believe in, better God than the people who watch NBC news.

According to UCC Rules Committee member, Nancy Ballabeuster, &amp;ldquo;God could not have foreseen such changes in human relationships as we&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed in the past 30 years. We know that God is love, and as such She would want us to have a Bible that makes everyone feel good about herself, regardless of sexual orientation, race, or criminal activity.</description>

      <description>Your Excellency:
Thank you for giving us the Tridentine Mass at the beautiful St. Francis de Sales church.
I grew up, mostly, in the Novus Ordo Missae. Over the past 30 years, I have seen the Mass go from a reverent, prayerful worship of God, to a social gathering, to, now, something that seems more like a baseball game. I use Perpetual Adoration, the daily Rosary, and novenas to pray, because prayer during Mass has become almost impossible.</description>

      <description>You walk up a flight of granite stairs to a pair great wooden doors beneath a spire rising, it seems, miles toward the heavens. The heavy door opens slowly, because of its weight, but surprisingly easily, like a perfectly balance vault door.
The vestibule is dark and reverent, not grand at all. It might be the foyer of an old, downtown office building except for the small stained-glass windows. Then to the inner doors, smaller, but heavy and wooden.</description>

Sadly, there was really a Roman Catholic Cardinal, Jaime L. Cardinal Sin, who passed away.
He must have been very holy man. Imagine the Holy spirit&amp;rsquo;s work at convincing a Pope to promote someone named Sin to Cardinal.</description>

Until very recently, the Church of England was more closely united with the Roman Catholic church than any mainstream Protestant church.
It is because of the Anglican church&amp;rsquo;s proximity to Rome that I desire its internal reformation.

Is it possible that the most dangerous thing on earth is the believer who doesn&amp;rsquo;t trust God?
Someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in God is capable of doing great harm to himself, his family, and his community.</description>

      <description>Thanks toRomanCatholicBlog, I found this essay on abused liturgy by one of my heroes, Fr. James Schall, author of &amp;ldquo;Another Sort of Learning.&amp;rdquo;
Father&amp;rsquo;s Day, we attended Mass with my in-laws, including my wife&amp;rsquo;s grandfather, in Illinois. Instead of a homily, the priest decided to (ab)use that portion of the Holy Sacrifice to conduct a survey. Ushers passed out forms like baseball All-Star ballots. Those of us who were not members of the parish were left to sit and pray amongst ourselves while the parishioners applied their number 2 pencils to the little dots.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a certified apologist or anything, but after 15 years of Catholic education I have a pretty good headful of catechetics. I think the reason I never actually asked my wife to become Catholic was that I enjoyed my position as household expert on the church. My wife is a lot smarter than I am, much better educated, and much dedicated to the things she finds important.
A month and a half ago, she began &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo; about becoming Catholic.</description>

      <description>Last night, I was lucky enough to have my second hour before the exposed Eucharist in one week. My wife was out of town with the kids, so I took her place.
My usual hour is in the morning, before work. The sun is up, the room is bright. It&amp;rsquo;s like Easter morning.
But in the evening, it&amp;rsquo;s different. It&amp;rsquo;s more like the Agony in the Garden. The room seems larger and darker.</description>

      <description>Hey, I realize that my readership has dropped from about 1,000 a day to a handful a day since I left the world of politics to concentrate on God. I don&amp;rsquo;t care. Well, I do. It&amp;rsquo;s symptomatic of the reason I turned toward God: this world loves sin, lies, and death. It hates goodness, truth, and life.
In my return to the Holy Mother church, I am so fortunate that my parish has a Perpetual Adoration chapel.</description>

      <description>Tonight in Guatamala, in a place lush with plants and beauty such that one from the comfortable but dry Midwestern United States might think &amp;ldquo;paradise&amp;rdquo; on first glance, lies a little girl. Her family has so little. The floor of their tin-roofed house is dirt. She has a matress, I understand. She like to sing and dance. She&amp;rsquo;s four and beautiful.
Dearest Lord Jesus, you love little ones so dearly. They are our spiritual mentors.</description>

Father, I can see beauty in your heart. I have read the testimony of your parishoners, and I can see that you bring people to Jesus. How gratifying that must be, Father. I wish I could touch so many souls.</description>

And yet, You forgive. In the abyss of Your fathomless mercy, You find a way to forgive me for my transgressions&amp;ndash;my creative, evil, flesh-thrilling transgressions.
How do I repay You? An eternity of homage would be too little.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get on a rant against Episcopalians, here, but RomanCatholicBlog and Ex-Pagan bring us links to a travesty in an Episcopal church that I must point out.
I know some took offence at my original swipe at the Anglican church last week. I even felt a little writer&amp;rsquo;s remorse, thinking, maybe, I&amp;rsquo;d been over the top. But God works, sometimes, in obvious ways. Aside from tacking a list of 95 Antitheses to their own heads and declaring God dead, I cannot think of surer way than The Clown Eurcharist to demonstrate to the world that one considers his own religion a joke.</description>

She just got up from the couch to give the little guy a bath, stopping on the way through the living room to check on the fish and to pick up something left dropped on the floor by a thoughtless child.

Reading his letter to the parish, I felt the hair on the back of my neck rise to attention. Some months ago, I nearly joined the very church Rev. Kimel is leaving. Thank you, God, for sparing me that humiliation, though I fully deserve the humiliation I would have felt.

      <description>The Friday before John Paul II died, EWTN aired a documentary about Polish saints. For me, the most fascinating was St. Maria Faustina Kowalska, canonized by Pope John Paul II in 2000.
Her diary, at 700 pages, is the most powerful testimony of faith I have ever read. Those who do not understand the joy of suffering for God must read this work of pure faith. Before I picked up the text last month, I was familiar with the phrase &amp;ldquo;offer it up.</description>

      <description>While reading the links from the Nunsense story on RomanCatholicBlog, I found this. I have only skimmed it so far, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good story, well written, timely, and encouraging.
Conversion stories are among the most importat to reinforcing faith. All of the Epistles, really, were testimony to conversions of Jews, pagans, Greeks, Romans, and others. We learn so much about our faith from those who came to faith as adults or who returned after being adrift in secular confusion.</description>

Closer, though, she&amp;rsquo;s not as young as I thought. But even more beautiful. Pushing her cart through the supermarket, studying various reliefs for indigestion, her back to the world, to me, I wanted to catch her eye and just say &amp;ldquo;hello.&amp;rdquo; But I chickened out.</description>

      <description>Tear a banana from a bunch and show it to someone. Ask them to identify it.
Thats a banana, theyll say.
Now, peel the banana, hold up the fruit, and ask them what it is.
A banana, theyll say, probably somewhat confused at your obvious questions.
Set aside the fruit and hold up the peel. Once again, ask them to identify what you hold.
A banana peel.
The banana is a banana without its peel, but the peel is not a banana without its fruit.</description>

      <description>Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska adored silence. Only through her special relationship with Jesus Christ could she find the inner strength to pray, to contemplate, worship, and hear God, amid the din of her convent. I can only imagine the cacophony of that house of nuns.
With Mothers Day commitments abound, I was reduced to attending 5:30 Mass tonight. I lasted 10 minutes18 if you count the time before the Mass started.</description>

Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve felt a pang of guilt for leaving the Blessed Mother out dry. She would never do that to me&amp;ndash;and that explains much about her role.</description>

      <description>Chesterton, comparing and contrasting Sts. Francis of Assisi with St. Thomas Aquinas, said, &amp;ldquo;[I]t is the paradox of history that each generation is converted by the saint who contradicts it most.&amp;rdquo;
Chesterton was not a prophet, but a genius. As such, his observations of history serve as predictions of the future. Pope John Paul II became pope when detente was still in the air, when Jimmy Carter was urging the world to accept the perpetualism of Soviet communism, when Americans were told that our best days were behind us.</description>

      <description>Recently, a very good man, a Bishop in the Old Catholic church, wrote to me about his concern that I live in fear of God rather than in the light of God&amp;rsquo;s infinite love and mercy. His message made me realize that I had been, up to that point, too vague about how to fear God. I wrote him:
 Thank you. Your words are comforting, though I don&amp;rsquo;t have much fear of God, except the kind of fear one naturally has toward something of incomprehensible greatness.</description>

&amp;ldquo;O Lord, make me an instrument of Thy Peace! Where there is hatred, let me sow love. Where there is injury, pardon. Where there is discord, harmony. Where there is doubt, faith. Where there is despair, hope. Where there is darkness, light. Where there is sorrow, joy.
Oh Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love; for it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life.</description>

So, why have a church?
How indicative of our selfishness, our vainglory, to ask our churches to read the Bible then teach the opposite. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that what the devil is for?

      <description>Thanks be to God.
Already theleft media in the USA (J. Rob)is denouncing the selection of Joseph Ratzinger as new pope. CBS News called him &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rsquo;s Rottweiler,&amp;rdquo; an obvious play on his German nationality. That term was echoed by other networks and news agency, indicating that the term is part of talking points distributed by anti-Catholic liberals in the United States.
A couple of weeks ago, people argued with me about who the Cardinals would choose.</description>

      <description>Undoubtedly, high fuel costs in their 3rd year (and 4th of 5) will drive up costs overall. But the Fed is promising to attack inflation aggressively. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise, then, that wages are falling (against cost of living).
The reduced disposable income numbers has hurt sale of snack foods, candy, soft drinks. The Dow is about to dip below 10,000.
Perhaps the Fed needs to allow cash to rise to levels consistent with the real cost of fuel.</description>

Yes, the sun&amp;rsquo;s shining bright, Everything seems alright As we murder a fetus in the womb.
We&amp;rsquo;ve gained notoriety And caused much anxiety In the Vitae Society With our games.</description>

      <description>In Illinois, quickly becoming the most leftist state in the union, Planned Parenthood and other infanticide supporters, are pushing a bill through the state&amp;rsquo;s legislature that will make it more difficult for pregnant women to obtain ultrasounds, according to the _Illinois Leader _via Jack Lewis.
Why?
Because seeing a picture of an unborn child tends to turn women against whimsical murder&amp;ndash;the chief form of amusement for Planned Parenthood.

      <description>A seemingly drunk Ward Churchill is spewing bizarre conspiracy theories on C-SPAN, taped March 25, 2005. He claims that 6 in 10 New Yorkers believe that September 11 was perpetrated by the US Government. He went on to say that he won&amp;rsquo;t give &amp;ldquo;white guys&amp;rdquo; credit for the attacks until he has proof.
He&amp;rsquo;s having a very difficult time reading the questions.

      <description>Most people who dabble in politics and political writing can point to one defining moment, one event, one story that crystallized some nebulous thoughts into a clear, palatable drive to do something. If you were born in 1963, the youngest of four, and you watched the excesses of the 1960s rip your older sisters from your parents, you share a lot with me.
On November 4, 1979, I lay in the bathtub warming sore, cold muscles after a rare Sunday high school football game.</description>

      <description>Politics used to end at the water&amp;rsquo;s edge. Now it ends at the treatment room.
Peter Jennings announced today that he has lung cancer&amp;ndash;the deadliest cancer of them all.
Many who read this blog detest Jennings&amp;rsquo;s politics, as do I. But Peter Jennings&amp;rsquo;s life hasn&amp;rsquo;t been all roses. When Don Imus made fun of his marital situation a few years ago, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t laugh. Perhaps Imus had never loved. Or perhaps he&amp;rsquo;d been spared the pain of a love that blinded him to the treachery of the object of his affection.</description>

      <description>I planned to write a column-length piece today. I even mapped out an outline: Terri Schiavo, Jesse Jackson, the Colorado Supreme Court.
Then the Pope died.
I sat here for a couple of hours trying to think of something to write. I thought of much. Unfortunately, none of the things would interest readers.
There&amp;rsquo;s been too much death lately. Minnesota, Terri Schiavo, little girls in Nebraska and Florida, the Pope, even Johnnie Cochran.</description>

      <description>The Vatican just announced that the Pope suffered heart failure earlier this evening. Dr. Arthur St. Andre says that he may . . . may . . . be surviving only on his IV to keep his blood pressure up. The Vatican describes the pontiff as seriously ill but lucid and comfortable. There are reports that doctors recommended he return to the hospital, but he personally declined. Obviously, he wants to die at what has been his home for the past quarter century.</description>

Ms. Derse was kind enough to respond to my e-mail to the Board of Education in which I commented on past published reports that Ms. Derse, while principal at another school, reduced military recuriting presence. My contention was that Ms. Derse had established a pattern of anti-military behavior, to which she responds:
 Mr. Hennessey, however it was reported, the truth of what took place was that if military recruiters were to have remained in the student activity center as they had done, then Mr.</description>

      <description>Police barred Terri Schiavo from receiving the sacrament of communion today. For Easter, I wanted to express some thoughts on the Catholic church&amp;ndash;the community that Judge Greer has isolated Terri from.
 Nine out of ten of what we call new ideas are simply old mistakes. The Catholic Church has for one of her chief duties that of preventing people from making those old mistakes; from making them over and over again forever, as people always do if they are left to themselves.</description>

      <description>FoxNews reports that the Schindlers are filing a final appeal to the Supreme Court.
Developing . . .
 Pinellas Circuit Judge George Greer (search) rejected their argument that Schiavo tried to say &amp;ldquo;I want to live&amp;rdquo; hours before her tube was removed March 18. They argued that she said &amp;ldquo;AHHHHH&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;WAAAAAAA&amp;rdquo; when asked to repeat the phrase.
 Also, details of Greer&amp;rsquo;s rejection of Friday night&amp;rsquo;s plea are emerging:</description>

      <description>Judge George Greer rejected the Schindler&amp;rsquo;s last appeal to save Terri.
From Fox News:
 A state judge on Saturday rejected another attempt by Terri Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s parents to reconnect her feeding tube, rejecting what the couple&amp;rsquo;s lawyer described as their last chance to keep their severely brain-damaged daughter alive.
 The Schindlers said they will not appeal again.
Those who have sacrificed, prayed, e-mailed, blogged, hoped, and cried for Terri may feel defeated.</description>

 Hours after a judge ordered that Terri Schiavo was not to be removed from her hospice, a team of state agents were en route to seize her and have her feeding tube reinserted &amp;ndash; but they stopped short when local police told them they would enforce the judge&amp;rsquo;s order, The Herald has learned.</description>

 A Bronx teacher who repeatedly flunked his state certification exam paid a formerly homeless man with a developmental disorder $2 to take the test for him, authorities said yesterday.
 But it gets better. What made authorities suspicious was that the homeless guy scored so much higher than the teacher ever scored they knew something was amiss.</description>

      <description>FoxNews just played audio of the David Gibbs&amp;rsquo;s phone call to Judge Greer in which Gibbs read the affidavit of the woman who soliticited a plea for life from Terri Schiavo on the day her feeding tube was removed.
The affidavit is stunning. There were numerous witnesses who heard Terri say &amp;ldquo;Aaah&amp;rdquo; and then yell &amp;ldquo;Waahn.&amp;rdquo; Among the witnesses was a female police officer.
Why in the name of God are just hearing about this now?</description>

      <description>My daughter died of complications from childhood diabetes more than 10 years ago. At the time, I was warned that diabetes research charities are not very interested in finding a cure. That would put them out of business. Moreover, JDRF seems to prefer people dying to giving up its political bent on stem-cells:
 SCIENCE DID publish the study demonstrating that adult spleen stem cells completely cured mice with late stage juv.</description>

      <description>Perhaps the UN&amp;rsquo;s goal in Sudan is to wait until all of the victims are dead. That would make &amp;ldquo;peace keeping&amp;rdquo; a heck of a lot easier, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it? For that matter, why don&amp;rsquo;t they take a page from the Terri Schiavo story and supply arms and ammo to the team that&amp;rsquo;s winning?
Instead, the UN Security Council, yesterday, took the baby step of approving a peace keeping force for the country.</description>

      <description>I have to agree withEd Morrissey on this: Governor Bush has done all he can do, and he must not violate the law to save Terri Schiavo.
That might sound callous, but staying within the law is now our last refuge. As Thomas More told Will Roper in Robert Bolt&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;A Man for All Seasons&amp;quot;:
 This country&amp;rsquo;s planted thick with laws from coast to coast &amp;ndash; man&amp;rsquo;s laws, not God&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash; and if you cut them down &amp;ndash; and you&amp;rsquo;re just the man to do it &amp;ndash; d&amp;rsquo;you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then?</description>

      <description>Today is the day we celebrate Christ&amp;rsquo;s conviction, scourging, and execution. Celebrate is the correct word. Two thousand years of Hebrew prophecies indicated that the messiah would would be put to death for speaking the truth.
I finally watched Mel Gibson&amp;rsquo;s The Passion of the Christ&amp;rdquo; this week. I had to laugh. It is not a funny movie, but the year&amp;rsquo;s separation from the ignorant blather leading up to its release seems so funny in retrospect.</description>

      <description>The CU Chancellor has sent out an e-mail regarding the Ward Churchill investigation. Michelle Malkin blogged the press conference earlier.
 SUBJECT: CHANCELLOR&amp;rsquo;S EMAIL TO PREVIOUS WRITERS
 FROM: Office of the Chancellor
SENDER: Collect@Colorado.edu
DATE: March 24, 2005
Dear Friend:
You were one of many citizens who wrote or called the University of Colorado at Boulder concerning the controversial essay about 9/11 written by Professor Ward Churchill. Because of your interest, I am writing to share with you the outcome of our review of allegations concerning Professor Churchill&amp;rsquo;s conduct and scholarship.</description>

      <description>Taking its lead from the Supreme Court, which has recently ruled that the Constitution is un-Constitutional if the European Union says so, the Federal Election Commission, today, declare the First Amendment, while protecting displaying a crucifix in a jar of urine, does not apply to political speech.
Think I&amp;rsquo;m joking? I&amp;rsquo;m not. (See PoliPundit and LGF) If the FEC&amp;rsquo;s proposed rules are adopted, Americans will have to clear their e-mails and blogs with the KGB&amp;ndash;that is, the FEC&amp;ndash;prior to sending.</description>

      <description>Judge Greer having denied Governor Jeb Bush&amp;rsquo;s petition to make Terri Schiavo a ward of the state, the Schindlers seem to be out of legal and political options.
Terri&amp;rsquo;s life is in God&amp;rsquo;s hands. In truth, it always has been.
Those who have fought valiently to save Ms. Schiavo must take pride in having fought a good fight. Whatever Michael Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s motives may have been, and whatever the motives of those who took his side, we are best to assume their intentions noble absent evidence to the contrary.</description>

      <description>Winter has been warmer and wetter
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch tried to alarm readers with its headline. Unfortunately, the story didn&amp;rsquo;t fit the bold print.
It turns out that St. Louis had its 17th warmest winter on record. Meteorological winter in St. Louis runs from December 1 through February 28, so the exceptionally cool March won&amp;rsquo;t change the fact. Still, 17th out of 130 does not seem dramatic at all.</description>

(There are pictures of me far more frightening, but I&amp;rsquo;ve kept them out of the public domain.)
My brief reactions to the hideous story is here, but I&amp;rsquo;ll add this:
NO ONE saw this coming?
Hey, Lee Siegel: Don&amp;rsquo;t you wish this kid had run into Ashley Smith, too? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if more people found God&amp;rsquo;s purpose for them?</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago, I blogged about Lee Siegel&amp;rsquo;s anti-religious diatribe in the current The New Republic on-line (registration required). I just re-read his piece, and found something I missed.
I figured Siegel an atheist. He&amp;rsquo;s not. He believes in God, but he&amp;rsquo;s angry at Him. Very angry.
I wonder if a lot of atheists are actually just believers angry that they&amp;rsquo;re not God.
In Luigi Pirandello&amp;rsquo;s Six Characters in Search of an Author, we learn the absurdity of anger at one&amp;rsquo;s creator.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Sam! Sam! American Idol&amp;rsquo;s on! Jordan, go get Sam!&amp;rdquo;

Second, I will now drink a Diet Coke, watch the rest of Letterman, and climb into bed beside the most wonderful woman in the world.
Please remember: As disturbing as the Schiavo case may be, the world goes on. There are democracies to grow in the Middle East and children to education educate in the United States.</description>

The Corner on National Review Online
   it is worth remembering that the excruciating slowness of the execution here, the incremental-ness of death, is designed by its champions to inure us to it. After the first hour, the second passes with far less fanfare, and the third less still. I&amp;rsquo;ve been following this closely, and I needed to remind myself today how many hours Terri Schiavo has actually been without sustenance by counting the days since Friday afternoon and multiplying by 24.</description>

 The guy on the street is often wrong about general principles of his environment. In other words, when a non-expert pontificates about the weather, the human brain, or the government, he&amp;rsquo;s very likely to come off as Cliff Clavin.
Experts, on the other hand, are usually expert only about general nature of a specific study.</description>

I think, not so much of the killer, but of the other kids, even the bullies. Yesterday, they had plans. Today, they have wings.
 Hegstrom described the shooter grinning and waving at a student his gun was pointed at, then swiveling to shoot someone else. &amp;ldquo;I looked him in the eye and ran in the room, and that&amp;rsquo;s when I hid,&amp;rdquo; she told The Pioneer.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s not much to say. Judges have determined, in logical order, the following:
A. Michael Schiavo is Terri Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s husband; therefore, B. Michael Schiavo is Terri&amp;rsquo;s legal guardian; therefore, C. Michael Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s desires trump laws of the state and of morality.
Florida law does not permit the execution of a person in Terri Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s condition. The judges (like Glenn Reynolds and James Joyner and others) are too cowardly to come out and say, &amp;ldquo;Look, people, the mentally ill make us kind of sick.</description>

      <description>For the best late news and commentary, see Michelle Malkin&amp;rsquo;s early morning update. Please follow the links. Perhaps you don&amp;rsquo;t want the feds involved because you, like I, support federalism. In this case, a state judge has ordered health care workers to murder an innocent woman. Hiding behind political ideology, in this case, won&amp;rsquo;t keep you from being as complicit in murder as the good Germans living a mile from a death camp who said nothing, did nothing, saw nothing, heard nothing.</description>

      <description>Many people, including many conservative bloggers, believe that justice has been served in Florida. Terri Schiavo should be starved to death as ordered by Judge Greer. (And, please, don&amp;rsquo;t insult my integrity or intelligence by claiming he ordered otherwise. His order prohibits anyone from giving the woman food, water, or any other nutrients. He ordered her starved to death, not denied artificial support.) Well, I think that most of the people who support her murder must be ignorant of what they wish for.</description>

Subject: READ ONLY IF YOU HAVE TIME FOR GOD
God, when I received this e-mail, I thought&amp;hellip;
I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for this&amp;hellip; And, this is really inappropriate during work.
Then, I realized that this kind of thinking is&amp;hellip; Exactly, what has caused lot of the problems in our world today.</description>

      <description>As you can probably tell from the drastic change to my layout, I am switching from CommunityServer (which you probably know as .Text) to WordPress.
Why?
I am a Microsoft Kool-Aid guzzler. As such, I have tried to keep my blog 100% .Net. I worked through the betas and release candidates for CommunityServer. I really wanted to make it work.
Unfortunately, the current version of .Text is not ready for prime time.</description>

      <description>Outside The Beltway : Bush Returning to Washington Over Schiavo
   So, now, we&amp;rsquo;re going to spend hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to subvert the legal process and the wishes of both Michael and Terri Schiavo in this matter?
 Yesterday, I pointed out that, as individuals, we need to look on the Terri Schiavo ordeal from God&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint. But that&amp;rsquo;s the individual issue. Beyond that, we have to contend with the political/judicial aspects of this case.</description>

      <description>In the battle over Terri Schiavo, I have found but one pertinent argument
OpinionJournal - Peggy Noonan
   There is a passionate, highly motivated and sincere group of voters and activists who care deeply about whether Terri Schiavo is allowed to live. Their reasoning, ultimately, is this: _Be on the side of life. They remind me of what Winston Churchill said once when he became home secretary in charge of England&amp;rsquo;s prisons.</description>

      <description>Heres a telling quote from St. Louis Post-Dispatch sports columnist Bernie Miklasz:
   McGwire was such a disappointment. He showed no guts. If he isnt going to take a stand and defend himself against steroids accusations in such a highly publicized and open setting, then I no longer feel compelled to give him the benefit of the doubt on this issue. And Tony La Russa and others who have defended McGwire with such vigor are being made to look like fools.</description>

      <description>CNN.com - Reports: Car bomb explodes in Beirut - Mar 18, 2005
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) &amp;ndash; A car bomb has ripped through a predominantly Christian area of Beirut early Saturday, sheering off part of a multi-story office building and raising concerns about more violence in the volatile Lebanese capital.
 Some people hate peace. Tonight, some of them detonated a car bomb in Beirut. Likely, the goal is to divide Christians from Muslims.</description>

      <description>Today before the United States House of Representatives, former major league baseball player and one-time single season home run champion Mark McGwire disgraced himself, his profession, and his career.
Under friendly questioning from William Clay Jr., (D-MO), McGwire repeatedly refused to say if he&amp;rsquo;d ever taken even andro, which he more or less bragged about using when he was a Cardinal.
Clearly, McGwire was a heavy steroid user. I didn&amp;rsquo;t believe so just two weeks ago, but he looked as guilty as OJ today.</description>

      <description>Amazon is down! Been down since about 8:39 CST.
When Amazon crashed in 1999, it was BIG news. Oracle and Sun Solaris weren&amp;rsquo;t playing well together. Sent shock waves through the tech world. I can&amp;rsquo;t think of any major outages at the site since.
UPDATE: Maybe its my DNS server. Or maybe half the internet is down. I can get to MSN but not MSNBC. CNN comes up. USAToday does not.</description>

   &amp;ldquo;If Republicans want to go down this road, they are going to be beginning a huge, partisan, cataclysmic event, the implications of which are so profound that none of us really know the answer to it,&amp;rdquo; said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., one of the Democrats arrayed behind Reid on the Capitol steps. &amp;ldquo;It would mean the government could not function, which, more importantly, means we could not be doing the people&amp;rsquo;s work.</description>

   The man who fatally shot seven people during a quiet church service before turning the gun on himself was on the verge of losing his job and upset over a sermon he heard two weeks ago, investigators said Sunday.
 Let me get this straight: this guys having a tough time personally, then a sermon ticks him off. He gets his gun, goes to church, and kills a bunch of people, then himself.</description>

Why not put the detainees on a plane and fly them to Baghdad. Oh, while we&amp;rsquo;re at it, let&amp;rsquo;s implant tracking devices so we know where they are.</description>

      <description>European Union investigators are trying to pin the disappearance of Muslim terrorists on the CIA., according to this story on MSNBC.
What of it? Suppose the CIA is abducting terrorists like Abu Omar and secreting them off to Kuwait or Egypt or Saudi Arabia? So what? Would Italy prefer to harbor these monsters indefinitely?
This is a war against the kinds people who consider mere torture sport. If the abduction and aggressive interrogation of one sicko Muslim radical reveals enough information to thwart a future attack, the practice justifies itself.</description>

      <description>The left dismissed Michael Crichton&amp;rsquo;s book, State of Fear, attributing it to the rants of right-wing extremist. Crichton is actually an environmentalist and liberal, but once one strays off of the liberal plantation, he is no-good runner with rabbit in his blood who must be destroyed.
Dismissing Nicholas Kristof&amp;rsquo;s NYT Op-Ed column on the subject, though, may prove troublesome for tree huggers. Kristof&amp;rsquo;s environmentalist credentials are even more solid than Crichton&amp;rsquo;s, and his life includes the kind of humanitarian missions leftists talk about but rarely perform.</description>

   As a more moderate libertarian, I have no particular problem with the death penalty, but do find in many ways the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s ruling to be consistent with how many want to view teenagers in this society.
 Mike makes some interesting assumptions about social conservatives&amp;rsquo; views of teens.</description>

      <description>In 1992, I started a little company to produce and sell political t-shirts, sweatshirts, and bumperstickers. It remained at break even too long, so I folded. (Some of you might have our best-seller: I Got Wet When Clinton Soaked the Rich.) I never bought anyone else&amp;rsquo;s stuff because I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought my ideas were better.
Along comes ThoseShirts.com. I&amp;rsquo;m wearing this one right now:

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Week&amp;ndash;every Irishman&amp;rsquo;s favorite seven days.
Today, the people who wish they were Irish held a parade in Downtown St. Louis. I didn&amp;rsquo;t go, of course, because I attend the annual Ancient Order of Hibernian&amp;rsquo;s Dogtown Parade on the 17th.
The Hennessys meet at West Park and Tamm. Stop by if you&amp;rsquo;re about. After the parade, we&amp;rsquo;re making the trek to Ellisville for Matt and Angie Clancy&amp;rsquo;s fantastic Corned Beef and Cabbage.</description>

      <description>In an increasingly famous interview, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described herself as a &amp;ldquo;mildly pro-choice Republican.&amp;rdquo; But the pro-abortion folks would have to describe her as anti-abortion.

Yahoo! News - DNA Evidence Found in Judge Killings Case
   _A DNA match from a cigarette butt convinced police that a Chicago electrician was the killer of a federal judge&amp;rsquo;s husband and mother, authorities said. _
 For a week, the leftist press typed its stories with crossed fingers that some white supremist hate group murdered the judges family. Instead, it was a run of the mill, disgruntled plaintiff.</description>

      <description>Back in the early 90s (and isn&amp;rsquo;t that frightening?) I was doing something like blogging in Groton, Connecticut, for Town Hall on CompuServe&amp;ndash;pre-Web days. One of the topics of the day was Generation X. People like Rush Limbaugh and others got a kick out of making fun of Xers. They were slackers who wanted to make $45.00 an hour flipping burgers. Or, better, they wanted to graduate from college and step into an eighty grand a year job with a company car.</description>

A big, burly guy in a plaid, flannel shirt and dirty jeans walk into a C.J. Muggs&amp;ndash;a pretentious bar in Clayton, Missouri where lots of lawyers hang out after the courts close. The big guy orders a Busch and a shot of tequila, which downs in a loud, rude gulp. He slams the shot glass on the bar startling the suits around him.</description>

Captain Ed sums up McCain&amp;rsquo;s chicanery quite well:
   Here we have a man who has done more harm to the First Amendment as anyone in the past generation, all the while scolding us on coordination of electoral efforts, and he&amp;rsquo;s playing a shell game with Cablevision in order to gin up indirect payments to his staff.</description>

      <description>Acting class. The actor and the scene. Script. Or not. Mime. Gibberish. Make believe. A wise director, in response to an actor&amp;rsquo;s complaint about lack of motivation, said, &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s all make believe.&amp;rdquo;
In the best acting, the more &amp;ldquo;make believe&amp;rdquo; the presentation, the more real. A great play demands that you strip the stage of technology and present truth in angry, cold, black and white, two-dimensional reality. Truth shines through, unencumbered by sets and lights.</description>

      <description>The union workers I grew up around weren&amp;rsquo;t liberals by any stretch. They were Archie Bunker (and I mean that in a good way). Since the early 1980s, though, their unions have abandoned putting workers first in favor of putting leftwing ideology first. The result has been a massive exodus from the union shops into non-union companies.
But the unions have also done a disservice to the entire middle class. By concentrating on politics instead of labor issues, the AFL-CIO and other big unions have favored policies that destroy middle class jobs.</description>

   The audacious move to buy the NHL is the first of its kind involving a major U.S. sports league. If successful, a sale would convert the NHL from a collection of 30 individual franchises to what&amp;rsquo;s known in the sports industry as a single entity.</description>

UPDATE: Looks like I was way, way off base with this explanation. According to theHouston Chronicle, the Texas legislator sponsoring the bill is Republican Phil King. King&amp;rsquo;s says that when municipalities provide free internet access they screw up the free market.
   King&amp;rsquo;s basic objection, Trainor said, stands  in a free-market system it&amp;rsquo;s not acceptable to let public government compete with private businesses</description>

Since 2000, Senator, you have worked overtime at binding the spirit and body of the American people. You deny us, the people, free speech. You deny us, the people, free movement. You deny us, the people, the freedom other men died to give you in Vietnam.</description>

      <description>Okay, I know I&amp;rsquo;m not a genius like the mad doctor from Vermont, but could someone explain the logic of Dean&amp;rsquo;s latest idiotic blusterfest?
On the one hand, he extolls (kind of) the virtues of &amp;ldquo;tolerance&amp;rdquo;:
          &amp;ldquo;Moderate Republicans can&amp;rsquo;t stand these people (conservatives), because they&amp;rsquo;re intolerant. They don&amp;rsquo;t think tolerance is a virtue,&amp;rdquo; Dean said, adding: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to have these right-wingers throw away our right to be tolerant.</description>

      <description>Well, we know that the left opposes the death penalty for the likes of Dennis Rader, the BTK killer, but some do support capital punishment for political speech and activity. Stephen Crockett wants murder Katherine Harris and Ken Blackwell because they&amp;rsquo;re Republicans. Combine this with the DUer who wants to beat the crap out of the 9-year-old for Social Security reform, and you have the makings of a leftwing lynch mob.</description>

      <description>The disturbing case of Ward Churchill has me asking a question I ought not ask, but somehow feel compelled. The NCAA has an arcane, complicated, often brainless set of rules regarding recruitment and pampering of college athletes. The rules require major universities to hire folks just to deal with compliance. I hate bureaucracies like that.
But the system effectively reduces the ability of a college to buy great sports teams. Moreover, the system demands that members require minimum (though way too minimal) education standards for student athletes.</description>

      <description>The drooling juveniles on DemocraticUnderground took time out from praising terrorists, defending rapists, and seeking relief for child molesters to decry the White Houses use of a nine-year-old to promote Social Security Reform.
Heres a sample of what the losers are saying:
        1. exploiting children&amp;hellip;yup, that&amp;rsquo;s family values, alright&amp;hellip;.
    Why, pray tell is the mother allowing this? It is one thing to encourage your child to read and develop their own opinions, but to allow others to exploit those earliest opinions of childhood (which most of us may recall, DO change over time)&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Michelle Malkin has much about a recent &amp;ldquo;Committed&amp;rdquo; episode on NBC in which the producers went out of their way to make a mockery of Catholicism. She makes an excellent point with a question:
        Will NBC be as responsive to the complaints of Catholic viewers as FOX was to the Muslims who protested the hit drama 24?
  Answer: Of course not.</description>

      <description>The BTK killer&amp;rsquo;s name is Dennis Rader. He is the poison that grows on the bottom of a cesspool. He is the stuff that Hell considers too vile to abide. He is sin incarnate.
A brave, good neighbor of his called him out two days after another neighbor died. She was a good woman dying of cancer with a little dog. She would let the dog out to go potty, and Dennis Rader, Animal Control Officer, would give her a citation.</description>

&amp;ldquo;The urgency ought to be simpler,&amp;rdquo; Gingrich said. &amp;ldquo;Every day young people are denied the opportunity to have a personal Social Security savings account, they are cheated out of that day&amp;rsquo;s compound interest.&amp;quot;
Bill Clinton made a political career of putting off everything that could be put off. Call it leadership by procrastination. He succeeded because thats the way people are. We put things off. Even the most anal, scheduled, organized worry-wart puts things off, particularly things he feels he can do nothing about.</description>

Steven Taylor beat me to this story that the people who provided Churchill a podium from which to spew hatred, terrorism, venom, and lies is considering buying out his contract, as they would with a failing football coach. (But one whose players like to rape girls.) Read the rest on Poliblog.

      <description>About a year ago, I fired off a letter writing campaign to Missouri legistors urging them to fight a movement, sponsored by then-governor Bob Holden, to require Chick Pox vaccines for all Missouri children entering school. Michelle Malkin points out that Ohio has passed such a law with a link to the chicken pox vaccine money trail. (There&amp;rsquo;s always a money trail.)
Mandatory chicken pox vaccines will kill people. According to Dr.</description>

      <description>Michelle Malkin has dug up some artwork claimed to be the original work of Terrorist Advocate Ward Churchill. But, clearly, the works are not original, unless Mr. Churchill channels 19th century western artists and photographers.
To those who say Churchill speaks for the American Indian better than anyone else, I say that his words that have so enchanted you most likely were plagiarized.
Since Churchill&amp;rsquo;s rabid defenders will not expend the energy to click Michelle&amp;rsquo;s link, here&amp;rsquo;s the pertinent part of a CBS4 in Denver story Michelle reprinted in whole:</description>

Basically, Corn says what we already know: Howard Dean is his own worst enemy, and, as DNC chairman, is turning into his party&amp;rsquo;s worst enemy. Specifially, Corn responds to Dean&amp;rsquo;s recent announcement that people are afraid to call themselves Democrats because &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not socially acceptable to be a Democrat.</description>

      <description>The Chris Rock quote that got so many conservatives so up in arms about abortion appears to be more pro-life than pro-choice, according to John Swansburg writing on Slate.
The controversy involves this line from Rock: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s beautiful that abortion is legal&amp;rdquo; and says that he likes to pick up women at abortion rallies. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Cause you know they&amp;rsquo;re [expletive].&amp;rdquo;
But that isolated sentiment is part of a larger theme in Rock&amp;rsquo;s routine, and, in reasonable context, constitutes a slap at the frivolity of &amp;ldquo;choice.</description>

While I&amp;rsquo;m not quite ready to jump on the Condi 08 bandwagon just yet, this is a very encouraging story for those who have. For obvious reasons, I think it most likely that our first female president and our first black president will come from the party viewed as the more conservative.

Hiring Kerry hacks demonstrates the UN&amp;rsquo;s tone-deafness to American politics. I&amp;rsquo;m still waiting for some ex-official to open the books on the Kofi Annan and his family money laundry.

      <description>Yeah, I know they won&amp;rsquo;t reply, but I figured I should ask, anyway.
   The Rocky Mountain News today claims that Mr. Ward Churchill received tenure as a result of Colorado University&amp;rsquo;s failure to explore an alleged offer of tenure from the University of California system.
  I am interested in knowing whether or not Mr. Churchill implied such offer was made, or if someone at Colorado merely assumed such.</description>

Taylor also noted that UofC waived some normal requirements in the process, namely demanding a PhD. Now we know that the left&amp;rsquo;s favorite nut case obtained both tenure and chair of Ethnic Studies at University of Colorado by lying. He convinced UofC that the University of California system had offered him professorship in American Indian studies, causing Colorado to rush his tenure through.</description>

      <description>Its about time. Joe Gandelman points out that the people who brought you the Swift Vets are taking aim on the AARPa corrupt, leftist organization committed to stealing from the young and giving to the old whilst limiting freedom for everyone and outlawing cell phones.
I despise the AARP and everything it stands for, particularly its blogroll. (Find it yourselfIm not providing a link to the wealthy old bastards.)
UPDATE: The spineless weasels took down their Blogroll.</description>

Usually, these stories garner only a &amp;ldquo;whatever&amp;rdquo; from me. Not sure why this one has me thinking about my kids and parents and wife. It does. Avian flu outbreaks in Vietnam bird populations threaten to spread across the world. This could be the worst pandemic since 1918. Worse than that even, since 72% of those diagnosed with this nasty virus &amp;ndash; die.
 The H5N1 avian flu, which first appeared in Hong Kong in 1997 and has since popped up twice, is evolving and can jump directly from birds to people, killing an estimated 72 percent of diagnosed victims, Gerberding said.</description>

      <description>You might have caught myrunning, er, conversation  (expand comments) with someone calling himself SoupMan. After a few shots at him (some unfair, I admit), he disclosed the link to his blog, Hip-Hop Politics. I took a look around. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t surprised by anything. Obviously, I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with anything, but nothing was shocking.
Mr. SoupMan was reluctant to share his link with me. He didn&amp;rsquo;t want hassles he&amp;rsquo;d experienced before.</description>

      <description>Windows is more secure than Linux for operating a web site, so concludes an independent study. And in more than ten years of helping companies embrace the internet and new technology, I can assure you that a front-to-back Microsoft solution is the least expensive possible. Sun hardware/Oracle DB is the most expensive and has the longest time to market. Linux lands in the middle of everything.

      <description>Movies that mimic documentaries often fall short in both emotional impact and believability. The September Tapes, by First Look Pictures, breaks that trend.
A man lost his young wife on Sepember 11, 2001, a passenger on one of the planes. In desparation and dissatisfied with the US military&amp;rsquo;s progress in finding and killing bin Laden, Don Larson sells all of his worldly possessions to finance a trip to Afghanistan to get answers on the hunt for bin Laden from the ground.</description>

      <description>Steven Taylor on Poliblog foundthe BBC story that Ruud Lubbers, the UN Refugee Head, resigned.
Yesterday,I blogged on a New York Times story that Lubbers would not resign, calling the numerous sexual harassment changes against him &amp;ldquo;lies.&amp;rdquo; That story also reported that Kofi Annan planned to seek legal advice on the matter over the weekend. Apparently, Lubbers felt the heat.
It looks like the UN&amp;rsquo;s closet door is open, and the skeletons are shaking out.</description>

      <description>Steven Taylor wonders how long it will take the left to claim the Wead tapes were manufactured by Karl Rove.
The answer: Not Long.
I strolled the DemocraticUnderground forum today. (Strolled? No. Jogged. Churchill said, &amp;ldquo;when you&amp;rsquo;re going through hell, keep going.&amp;quot;) Here&amp;rsquo;s what I found:
From OETKB:
        Given the author and its less than revealing information and a veiled attempt to portray this dangerous man(*) as &amp;ldquo;one of us,&amp;rdquo; this is one of those stories that has probably emenated from the bowels of the Heritage Foundation with the heavy guidance of Karl Rove.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, St. Louis had two major dailies: the St. Louis Globe-Democrat and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The Globe was the conservative newspaper. It&amp;rsquo;s where Pat Buchanan got his start. The Post was the liberal paper. Then the Globe folded, leaving St. Louis with only the lefty paper.
Since then, the quality of the Post has dropped precipitously. It is now a very bad paper with lousy writing, absent-minded editing, and incomplete coverage.</description>

      <description>Dean&amp;rsquo;s World  noticed that a Howard Dean support threw a shoe at Richard Perle when Perle began speaking at debate against Howard in Oregon yesterday.
Joe Gandelman, guest blogger, asks several questions about the mental state of the person who threw the shoe. But this is typical Deaniac behavior. Its why Dr. Dean wanted no press at the affair. His side has nothing to say, save for we have more shoes than we need, so you take some.</description>

      <description>The New York Times print edition has a delightful story about the new friendship between George Bush 41 and Bill Clinton.
Some of was pretty harsh on Clinton during his presidency, and Im certainly in that group. But a friendship between the presidents father and predecessor is good for everyone.
George H. W. Bush, a terrible politician and so-so leader, is a wonderful human being. Bill Clinton is a man of no real political convictions, endless charm, and endearing wit.</description>

Buckley on &amp;ldquo;Laugh In,&amp;rdquo; feel a twinge of guilt reflecting on the dark days of conservatism&amp;ndash;guilt for benefiting from the hard work of our predecessors. From 1932 until 1976, conservatism was as dead as Lincoln.
&amp;ldquo;I think it was John Kenneth Galbraith,&amp;rdquo; writes Martin Peretz in the current New Republic, &amp;ldquo;speaking in the early 1960s, the high point of post-New Deal liberalism, who pronounced conservatism dead.</description>

      <description>Originally posted October, 2000. Recycled because Joe Gandelman is pondering the state of undecidedness. Mark Noonan has some salient observations on the matter. I concur with Mark about both moderates AND Joe Gandelman&amp;rsquo;s blog&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s simply one of the best around.
After two debates, poll watchers cannot help but conclude that the people are stupid. By the people, I mean that horrid lot in the middlethe great-undecided voter, the noble vacillator, the independent voter, the moderate.</description>

 The current Social Security system is a very poor investment. A 25-year-old man is predicted to receive a 0.82 percent rate of return on his Social Security taxes.2 Low-income workers have extremely poor rates of return, and many low-income men will receive less in benefits than they paid in Social Security payroll taxes. A 25-year-old man living in Harlem would have a 4.</description>

      <description>According to the American Center for Law and Justice:
   Michael Newdow has filed a brand-new lawsuit in federal district court against the Pledge of Allegiance! He is also threatening to file suits in all 13 judicial circuits.
 Good heavens. Is it really that big of a deal, Michael? Leave it alone. Don&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;under God&amp;rdquo; when reciting the pledge. Instruct your children not to say it. But some of us growing weary of hearing what offends you.</description>

      <description>Le Moyne College has expelled a grad student for writing a paper (which recieved a grade of A) that advocates stricter discipline in schools. According to the dismissal letter, Le Moyne beleives that all students must strictly adhere to the administration&amp;rsquo;s philosophy of education. There is no room at Le Moyne for individual thinking, according to Cathy Leogrande, who signed the letter:
   Leogrande wrote, I have grave concerns regarding the mismatch between your personal beliefs regarding teaching and learning and the Le Moyne College program goals.</description>

      <description>A week or so ago, I warned that the MSM would launch a fierce counterattack against blogs in the face of Eason Jordan&amp;rsquo;s resignation. Michelle Malkin posted this story today about a blogger in Oklahoma who has been treatened by a Tulsa newspaper.
My guess is that The Tulsa World&amp;lsquo;s tactic of denying bloggers the privilege of linking to stories will become widespread. Unfortunately for the MSM, there are Fair Use principles in the United States that permit bloggers and anyone else to use copyright material without explicit permission.</description>

      <description>Some staggering statistics release yesterday show that, dollar for dollar, Google may be the most pro-Democrat company in the United States.
   Google employees gave $207,650 to federal candidates for last year&amp;rsquo;s elections, up from just $250 in 2000 when it was still a start-up. And 98% went to Democrats, the biggest share among top tech donors, a new USA TODAY campaign finance analysis shows.
 Russell Kirk said that conservatism is the absence of ideology.</description>

But wait . . . liberals don&amp;rsquo;t lose in courts in Europe. So the wackjobs&amp;ndash;Helen Steel and David Morris&amp;ndash;appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in, where else, France. That court ruled against Britain for failing to provide the couple with massive, expensive legal assistance.</description>

      <description>John Kerry tried to make a campaign issue out of the flu vaccine shortage. It didn&amp;rsquo;t work, but he tried. So did other senior Democrats.
Today we learn that flu shots may not prolong lives among the elderly.
   Led by National Institutes of Health researchers, the study challenges standard government dogma and is bound to confuse senior citizens. During last fall&amp;rsquo;s flu vaccine shortage, thousands of older Americans, heeding the government&amp;rsquo;s public health message, stood in long lines to get their shots.</description>

Instead, says Churchill, &amp;ldquo;I am seven-sixteenths Jewish, three-sixteenths Irish, and one-sixteenth rare, endangered Siberian Tiger.&amp;rdquo; The American Indian Movement and Keetoowah Cherokee tribe have for years denied Churchill credentials as an Indian.

      <description>I would love to do a study on the lifetime achievement of Rockwood School District.
The district covers far west St. Louis County, Missouri, and touts itself as one of the best school districts in the nation. Based on standardized scores, they have every right.
But Rockwood has some problems, too, and some of those problems have or will become societal problems.
Rockwood, it seems, prefers dealing with the highly intelligent, well-behaved children of very rich Wildwood folks.</description>

      <description>Over at Left2Right, Don Herzog claims that conservatives worship at the alter of &amp;ldquo;strict construction&amp;rdquo; of Constitutional matters.
   Strict construction means applying the language of the Constitution to what it straightforwardly refers to, not  here&amp;rsquo;s the connection  using it as a springboard to make stuff up.
 You&amp;rsquo;re wrong from the get-go, Don. Conservatives don&amp;rsquo;t honor strict constructionalism. We insist on original understanding.
Put simply, the framers of laws have one chance to get their meaning across in writing.</description>

She had read something I wrote about the United Nations. Her college indoctrinators had convinced her that the only to achieve anything close to justice in the world is to dissolve all governments save for the the UN.
Well, little girl who was too shy to pen her name, if you sawABC&amp;rsquo;s 20/20 tonight, you learned a little about that wonderful institution.</description>

I can see the MSM going berserk for the next two year. Everything the man says, does, and thinks broadcast live throughout the world as it happens. The liberal pundits will defend his frequent bouts of stupidity and insanity as demonstrative of his deep intellect.</description>

His writing is as enjoyable as his conversation&amp;ndash;and it&amp;rsquo;s conversation he has on talk shows, not interviews.

Ward Churchill has two choices: resign from CU and go to work for some leftwing think-tank that doesn&amp;rsquo;t care how much he lies on his resume, or move subtlely to the right.</description>

  Veteran party activist Donnie Fowler, who had been positioning himself as the alternative candidate to Dean, said it was &amp;ldquo;clear&amp;rdquo; Dean had the votes to become the new chairman when DNC members vote next week.</description>

According to administration sources speaking on condition of anonymity, the new tactics include ordering expensive pizzas for delivery to senior Bush administration officials&amp;rsquo; homes, making crank phone calls to American military high command at all hours of the night, and sending spam e-mails to American troops promising millions of dollars working from home&amp;ndash;all attempts to degrade morale.</description>

   All kinds of books came out post-911 that clearly laid out the fact that terrorists seek high body counts.

She&amp;rsquo;d contacted me through Match.com about two weeks earlier. I watched her cross Clayton Road. She moved like a dream&amp;ndash;beautiful, graceful, certain. We talked for over 3 hours. I sang all the way home&amp;ndash;40 minutes. I sang Sinatra and Lenny Kravitz.
We went out on Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, one week later.</description>

      <description>Three cheers for the general. Why can&amp;rsquo;t people just say it like is any longer?
        &amp;ldquo;You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn&amp;rsquo;t wear a veil,&amp;rdquo; Mattis continued. &amp;ldquo;You know, guys like that ain&amp;rsquo;t got no manhood left anyway. So it&amp;rsquo;s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.&amp;rdquo;
  Precisely.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: Steven Taylor favors us with an extensive examination of the Churchill debate with links to pertinent blogs and articles. I understand his points about the protections Churchill has built up over time: tenure, government employee, etc. As an originalist, I don&amp;rsquo;t buy the government employee protection because I don&amp;rsquo;t buy the conduit of the 14th Amendment argument. Further, firing him is not the same as incarcerating him. The state of Colorado is under no Constitutional or moral obligation to continue the employment of any person it deems detrimental to the state&amp;rsquo;s welfare.</description>

      <description>Before I ever heard the term blogging, I published three 500-750 word columns a week on my old website. That started in 1999. Work and other things became too demanding, so I let it lapse in 2001. This blog began about two years ago, but I got serious on December 15, 2003. I&amp;rsquo;ll mark that as my anniversary. It was the Monday after Saddam fell (crawled) into US custody.
Two gentlemen have been too kind to me in the past year.</description>

      <description>According to roving Hollywood reporter, Mike Evans, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&amp;rsquo;s popularity is now at 68%, six points higher than Ronald Reagan&amp;rsquo;s all-time high.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t think he&amp;rsquo;d run, then I didn&amp;rsquo;t think he&amp;rsquo;d win, then I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how well he&amp;rsquo;d do. But I have to admit, this guy seems to have been born to run the state of California. He&amp;rsquo;s been on top of the polls for over a year now&amp;ndash;probably the most popular governor of any state in the country over that period.</description>

      <description>Besides instantly becoming the most despised college professor in America&amp;ndash;not an easy thing to achieve, by the way&amp;ndash;Ward Churchill recieved two doses of bad news today:
First, though he claims 1/16 Cherokee, the tribe he claims to belong to says &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rsquo;s not one of us.&amp;rdquo; His name is nowhere in their database, so he&amp;rsquo;s not a member.
Next, the University of Colorado might fire him.
Good. I don&amp;rsquo;t like wishing ill on another, but this guy deserves to suffer for his stupidity.</description>

      <description>Calling for Mr. Churchill&amp;rsquo;s death, while consistent with his view of how one should treat those with whom he disagrees, would be too easy. Let&amp;rsquo;s keep this brainless, hate-spreading, son-of-a-bitch around awhile. I like kicking stupid bastards around, and Ward Churchill is my top candidate for Stupid Bastard of the 21st Century. That young people pay money to listen to his ignorance uttered demonstrates that, perhaps, American society is as troubled as he wishes it were.</description>

      <description>With Martin Frost out of the running for DNC Chairman, it looks more and more like Howard Dean, the biggest name among the three remaining contenders, will get the nod. Then again, we were all saying the same thing about Dean and the DNC nomination about this time last year.
While many Republicans cant wait for Dr. Dean to take his seat at the head of the opposition table, I am a little cautious.</description>

Good marketing to keep your name at the top of the Recently Updated lists, but, in my opinion, poor sportsmanship. </description>

      <description>I just saw the tape of Condoleezza Rice&amp;rsquo;s swearing-in as Secretary of State. Behind her stood her mother and father.
Rice came into the world during segregation in a segregated Alabama. Unlike Madelaine Albright, who discovered she was Jewish when a Jew in the cabinet migh help her president, Secretary Rice has known her life that she&amp;rsquo;s black. In Alabama as a girl, society didn&amp;rsquo;t let you forget.
Ms. Rice follows another African-American in the highest cabinet post of the most powerful country in the world.</description>

Archie wanted to watch football highlights, but Meathead wanted to watch a special with Jack Lemon about polution. Then Little Girl came home from the grocery store with organic food&amp;ndash;depriving Archie of his crunchy cereal with the animal cutouts on the box. The conversation moved to argument about a) the environment, b) race relations, c) drinking water, d) the war in Vietnam.</description>

      <description>Senator Mark Dayton, a Democrat from Minnesota, called Condoleezza Rice and President George Bush liars on the Senate floor today.
While Senators have used the word liar occasionally, those occasions have been rare. At one time, the word demanded censure or a duel. These days, coming from members of Bill Clinton&amp;rsquo;s party, one must assume &amp;ldquo;liar&amp;rdquo; is some sort of underhanded praise.
Condoleezza Rice&amp;rsquo;s confirmation is already in the books. She will receive more than 2/3 of the Senate&amp;rsquo;s endorsement.</description>

Armstrong says his brother is a good conservative who could not hope to win running as a Republican in that district. Good for Kent and for the people of his district. Party affiliation isn&amp;rsquo;t as important as core beliefs, and Kent Williams&amp;rsquo;s core seems as solid as a rock.</description>

      <description>Apparently, Howard Dean, America&amp;rsquo;s dumbest physician, was in Missouri to warn Democrats that he won&amp;rsquo;t run if they don&amp;rsquo;t make him head of the party. Now I really have no idea whether to support his DNC quest or not.
Thanks to Steven Taylor.</description>

      <title>Master/Detail Dropdownlists Without Postback</title>

      <description>Suppose you have three sets of data: Customers, Orders, Products.
You want to present three dropdownlists&amp;ndash;one for each set of data. When I select a Customer from list A, list is rebuilt with Orders for that customer, the first order is selected, and list C is updated with the Products for that order, the first Product selected.
Using ASP.NET postbacks is pretty straightforward, but it&amp;rsquo;s also pretty ugly. Al Alberto got us most of the way to a solution with this article on CodeProject.</description>

This is a great tool, but there are no migration scripts built into the beta versions. I had to move the old site into the new database myself, which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve been MIA. Well, that and some hideous deadlines at work.

      <description>This week, former NFL star with the Los Angeles Rams, Jack Snow, father of San Francisco Giants first baseman J. T. Snow, called into a sports radio show on station KFNS-590 AM. Snow hosts a weekly show on the same station. Snow read the riot act to muckraker Kevin Slaten over Slaten&amp;rsquo;s belittling of the St. Louis Rams.
While the Rams have done much to deserve criticism this season, Snow was right in two ways.</description>

      <description>I forgive Michael Crichton for the lack of details I criticized in part one. He had an important story to tell, and the color of Peter Evanss walls were irrelevant.
Irrelevant.
That word comes up again and again, but in Crichtons text and in the readers mind. While reading State of Fear, I found myself using that term, boldly, even rudely, in numerous conversations and arguments. So much of what the left says is irrelevant.</description>

      <description>Thanks to St. Louis Post-Dispatch columnist Bernie Miklasz for giving me some categories to score. More New Year&amp;rsquo;s posts at OTB
Biggest Bust: Howard Dean fell from coronated Democrat nominee to historical hiccough by screaming like a WWF nut after getting trounced in Iowa. Is there a more embarrassing position than Deaniac?
Honorable mention to John Kerry.
Biggest Boom: The United States economy. While EU countries trudge along with 10% unemployment and flat growth, the United States has begun a fundamentally solid and sustainable rally that will continue for another 4 years.</description>

      <description>The United Nations serves no worthwhile purpose. The United States should immediately withdraw from the UN and banish it&amp;rsquo;s buildlings from our shores. We should begin by refusing to participate in any UN emergency aid for countries victimized by the Christmas tsunami.
Why? Because America provides 40% of the total world charity while comprising less than 5% of the population, but the smug bastards at the UN call us stingy.</description>

Dear Mr. Muscara:
I just read the story in the Hampton Union about your misguided decision to bar a student from a dance because he wore a Santa costume.
You, Mr. Muscara, are a small, weak man.
Contrary to your statement that &amp;ldquo;we have a separation of church and state,&amp;rdquo; what we have is a protection of religious practice. Congress shall make no law .</description>

      <description>People who hated Christmas used to bother me. I hated hearing their diatribes about commercialism and expense and depression.
Over the years, though, my dreamy view of Christmas tarnished.
I can&amp;rsquo;t remember many Christmas presents from childhood, but I do remember so many other wonderful things. I think it was 1975 when Uncle Bob and Aunt Carol came over on Christmas Eve. They sat in the dining room with my Mom and Dad drinking and laughing.</description>

      <description>Did you know that no study has ever shown a correlation between quality of education and per-pupil spending among public schools?
Did you know that in New York City, only 55% of education budget goes to instruction?
Did you know that the higher the administrators to students ratio, the worse the education?
Did you know that teacher to pupil ratio is a lousy predictor of education quality?
Did you know that three of the worst school districts in the country are in the top five in spending per pupil?</description>

      <description>Time Magazine&amp;rsquo;s Man of the Year title often makes a mockery of the honor. Remember the PC?
This year, though, Time&amp;rsquo;s editors got it right. Tempted, no doubt, to embarrass their political enemy, the editors took the high road by selecting George W. Bush, the most remarkable President in half a century, as its Man of the Year, 2004.
   For sticking to his guns (literally and figuratively), for reshaping the rules of politics to fit his ten-gallon-hat leadership style and for persuading a majority of voters that he deserved to be in the White House for another four years, George W.</description>

      <description>Last week, I came across the news story about 12 homes under construction set ablaze in Maryland and used it to discuss eco-terrorism. Yesterday, authorities arrested a man named Aaron Speed. He is not known as an eco-terrorist, and apparently had no motive. Speeds works as a security guard protecting the home allegedly torched.
Something seems wrong here. While Speed has a history of mental illness, he reminds me of the guy they arrested in Atlanta for detonating a bomb during the Olympics.</description>

While I&amp;rsquo;m at it, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind punching whoever called it a &amp;ldquo;Giving Tree&amp;rdquo; instead of a Christmas Tree.

      <description>The DUers are really torn over Michael Crichton&amp;rsquo;s book, &amp;ldquo;State of Fear.&amp;rdquo; Many of them clearly don&amp;rsquo;t want you or anyone else to read the book. (&amp;ldquo;Once I put it down, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t pick it up!&amp;quot;)
Others try to arm readers with information to counter Crichton&amp;rsquo;s charges in the book. The counter-arguments are miserably lame and usually non-responsive to the charge. In other words, &amp;ldquo;we know we&amp;rsquo;re wrong, so change the subject.</description>

      <description>I live in Wildwood, Missouri, where traffic light cameras are popping up at all the intersections where new traffic signals are installed. It seems a new traffic signal is installed every week, too.
I heard Walter Williams talking last year about these devices increasing the number of accidents and the number fatal accidents at intersections where they&amp;rsquo;re installed.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the reason:
  The cameras aren&amp;rsquo;t cheap, but the manufacturers sell the city council on the ROI.</description>

I still haven&amp;rsquo;t reached a new decision on the death penalty. I&amp;rsquo;m in a no-man&amp;rsquo;s land where I want the death penalty to be available to juries, but I don&amp;rsquo;t that I could ever condemn a stranger.</description>

      <description>Ron Bilancia has a long post on DemocraticUnderground.org that attempts to use the movie &amp;ldquo;Miracle,&amp;rdquo; about the 1980 US Olympic Hockey Team, as roadmap for the Democrat party.
I agree with much of what Ron writes, but why are Democrats so godawful afraid to say &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re Americans?&amp;rdquo;
Bilancia catches most of the keys to the 1980 team&amp;rsquo;s success: brilliant coach, team play, focus, creativity, hard work, working for something outside yourself, and staying on the offensive.</description>

      <description>Mahmoud Abbas, the likeliest successor to Yassir Arafat, has called on Palestinians to lay down their arms.
When Arafat&amp;rsquo;s death proves sufficient to reduce tensions in the Middle East and maybe give some Israelis and Palestinians a chance to live out their lives without daily terror, the United Nations and its amen corner in America and France will look like idiots for fawning over Arafat so many years.
Arafat was a terrorist, self-serving hate-monger.</description>

      <description>American juries are awarding the death penalty with decreasing frequency these days. Good news.
I have vacillated on the death penalty for several years, beginning with witnessing the implosion of the old St. Louis Arena. (Long story.) But let&amp;rsquo;s give credit where it&amp;rsquo;s due: the death penalty itself.
Never having been a proponent of the deterrent of the death penalty, I have maintained that capital punishment can be defended on two grounds:</description>

      <description>Several bloggers have noted the stories that Taliban fighters, after three long years of ducking and running, are about ready to lay down their arms and become responsible citizens in a the world&amp;rsquo;s newest democracy.
Whether or not exhaustion gets the credit, US and Afghan military have captured two high value targets, including Mullah Omar&amp;rsquo;s personal security chief.
With these arrests, perhaps we&amp;rsquo;ll finally nab Omar. My guess is that, if he knows anything about Bin Laden&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts, he&amp;rsquo;ll sing.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finished the first 100 or so pages of Michael Crichton&amp;rsquo;s new book, State of Fear. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging about the book for a week, I owe some thoughts.
First, the story has grabbed me. The action begins quickly. While some reviewers have crticized the number of characters and the variety of venues, I find the pace excellent.
Second, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for massive debunking of wacko global warming theories, the book will start slowly.</description>

      <description>The combination of Michael Crichton&amp;rsquo;s recent publicity and Dean&amp;rsquo;s Nature of Science blog has me thinking about environmentalism.
Few leftist utterings irritate me more than the environmental nonsense that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard since about 1990. It all started with my knowledge of freon, particularly R-12 and R-114. I spent 10 years in the submarine force. Freon is a very dangerous gas on submarines because of its weight and its tendancy to turn into phosgene gas upon heating.</description>

      <description>What in God&amp;rsquo;s holy name does the Microsoft search engine do?
I can type the exact same entry into three or four separate engines and get back, more or less, the same results. Then, I enter the same search&amp;ndash;langa cleanxp&amp;ndash;into MSN&amp;rsquo;s search and get back goofy results. I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed this for a couple of years, but since launching their &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; search engine in November, the problem seems to be getting worse.</description>

      <description>Catholic parishes in St. Louis, Boston, and other US cities are closing for financial reasons. The church, you see, lost income and paid millions in judgements and settlements to victims of its child-molester priests.
Parishoners are rebelling, though. In St. Louis, the archdioces ordered St. Stanislaus Polish parish to turn over its assets to the archdioces. The parish said &amp;ldquo;no,&amp;rdquo; appealed to the Vatican, and lost. The parishoners continue to fight the turnover.</description>

      <description>Here we are half a week into Dean&amp;rsquo;s chairmanship, and the Democrats still don&amp;rsquo;t control Congress.
He has, though, picked up the rhetoric bulls**t where he dropped off when the loser, Kerry, kicked his lilly-white rearend out of the DNC primaries. He demanded that aGOP state chairman resign for making a rather innocuous observation, to wit:
   The Democrats simply have refused to learn the lessons of the past two election cycles, and now they can be accurately called the party of Barbara Boxer, Lynne Stewart and Howard Dean.</description>

Today, playing with a 3rd string running back, Arlen Harris, and a delapidated quarter, Chris Chandler, the Rams threw six&amp;ndash;count &amp;lsquo;em, six&amp;ndash;interceptions to the Carolina Panthers, all but forcing the Panthers to win.
The Rams gave up 3 opportunities to kick field goals, which would have made the score 20-16 late in the 4th quarter. As usual, they managed the clock poorly.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Joe Gandelman writing on Dean&amp;rsquo;s World, I just read George Will&amp;rsquo;s attempt at restoring sanity to liberalism and its party, the DNC. In this analysis, Will blames the stockpiling losses on liberalsm&amp;rsquo;s condescension, disrespect, and distrust of most Americans.
Will uses as an example a quote from Robert Kuttner writing in the leftist American Prospect:
        &amp;ldquo;Bill Clinton won election by declaring, as a matter of values, that people who work hard and play by the rules should not be poor.</description>

The report was promised on Tuesday of this week, then on Wednesday. Now, insiders say maybe January. My bet would be &amp;ndash; never.
While MoveOn.org thinks it has bought and paid for the DNC, they it will soon learn, as William F.</description>

Anyway, his sabbatical didn&amp;rsquo;t last long. He published two op-ed pieces in the New York Times this week, both railing against partial privatization of Social Security.
His argument? There is no Social Security crisis.</description>

Flew, now 81 years old, made his name scoffing at the silliness of people who &amp;ldquo;believe in a ghost in the clouds.&amp;rdquo; A professor of philosophy, Flew demanded proof of God&amp;rsquo;s existence before he would believe&amp;ndash;or let others believe unchallenged.</description>

I hope this kid matures enough to feel the shame he brought upon himself by taking a cowardly way out of hard work. I&amp;rsquo;d like to see his just war theory as written prior to 9/11.

      <description>Not since college in the early 1980s have I spent as much time reading what liberals have to write as I have since the election. Much of what I&amp;rsquo;ve read demanded an immediate response. Some, though, stewed in my mind until it has, just now, reached a consistency worth serving to my readers.
I know that the liberals didn&amp;rsquo;t really care for Kerry. He isn&amp;rsquo;t their hero or idol. They don&amp;rsquo;t respect him, really.</description>

Autos: Uncertainty. The SUV craze is waning, but nothing seems to fill the void. In my opinion, hybrids, especially big ones, may become de rigeur.
Publishing: Fewer reads, more material will lead publishers to jump on some craze, like the spiritualism of the 90s or journaling/letters of last year.</description>

      <description>This is from a peace rally somewhere. Does this Nancyboy Junior Lefty really look he needs someone to tell him not to bully weaker kids? And do his teachers ask him whether Saddam bullied people? Perhaps he should learn about the brides Saddam&amp;rsquo;s sons routinely raped on their wedding nights. Perhaps he should learn about the mass graves in Kurdish north. Perhaps he should be lifting weights instead of holding idiotic signs that make him look like a pansy.</description>

      <description>rom The Conservative Manifesto . . .
We believe that governments exist at the will of and to serve the governed.
We believe that a government&amp;rsquo;s only powers are those surrendered to it by those it governs, and that the governed may, at any time, reclaim their powers or deny the government of them.
We believe that the individual is free to do as he wishes within the rules set forth by the majority of his fellow citizens and their elected representatives.</description>

      <description>George Bush reaches into a frecas to extract one of his Secret Service agents in Chile.
Let me repeat: The President of the United States rescued one of his body guards from a fight with other body guards.
George W. Bush is the coolest president since Teddy Roosevelt. These are the moments that define men at the pinnacle.
The president is supposed to walk away, seek the safety of other leaders and security agents.</description>

      <description>Dean claims that it&amp;rsquo;s unnatural for conservatives and libertarians to accept the idea of corporations. I think he&amp;rsquo;s wrong. While he may have moral argument, it is of no practical value.
My point: there may be rational moral arguments against corporations, but they are as pointless as moral arguments against thinking bad thoughts. Without the security of a stock or bond and the protection of arms-length ownership, few intelligent people would invest in individuals who have what might be a good idea.</description>

      <description>Not since college in the early 1980s have I spent as much time reading what liberals have to write as I have since the election. Much of what I&amp;rsquo;ve read demanded an immediate response. Some, though, stewed in my mind until it has, just now, reached a consistency worth serving to my readers.
I know that the liberals didn&amp;rsquo;t really care for Kerry. He isn&amp;rsquo;t their hero or idol. They don&amp;rsquo;t respect him, really.</description>

      <description>America&amp;rsquo;s most cognitively challenged columnist, Maureen Dowd, wasted some good tree in Sunday&amp;rsquo;s New York Times spouting off about the the lack of Christian charity and forgiveness from the right.
The Christian avengers and inquisitors, hearts hard as marble, are chasing poor 74-year-old Arlen Specter through the Capitol&amp;rsquo;s marble halls, determined to flagellate him and deny him his cherished goal of taking over the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ms. Dowd writes.</description>

I grew up in a not-so-safe neighborhood in South St. Louis, but my parents let me experience the kinds of freedoms Heather had in a small town in Michigan. So I was shocked when the cops stopped my 13-year-old from walking to school in one of the safest suburbs in St.</description>

      <description>Jimmy Carter will probably attend Yassir Arafat&amp;rsquo;s funeral service in Cairo, Egypt. How typical of the man who considers the American Revolution a low point in world history.
Yassir Arafat was a tyrant, a murderer, a thief, a shameless self-promoter, a liar, a welcher whose ego killed more Palestinians than all of Israel&amp;rsquo;s weapons. While the UN and its amen chorus denounced Israel&amp;rsquo;s terrorism fence and the poverty Israel supposedly forced upon the Palestinians, Arafat moved hundreds of million of dollars to France&amp;ndash;money that might have alleviated Palestinian suffering.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that the liberal MSM would smear John Ashcroft in his retirement as they&amp;rsquo;ve smeared him throughout his career. But Newsweek&amp;rsquo;s coverage of Ashcroft is over the top. Their lead story, Ashcroft&amp;rsquo;s legacy, is an interview with a single person, David Cole, who has a toolshedfull of axes to grind with the outgoing Attorney General.
While liberals always have and always will hate Ashcroft, make up stories about him, accuse him of everything from fascism to the Johnstown Flood, this treatment is beyond the pale.</description>

At the time, John Ashcroft was Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Attorney-General who was seeking to replace Kit Bond as Governor.
As we slithered between preppily dressed bodies in the once glamorous hotel, a shout came from up ahead, repeated in various voices of shock and amazement.</description>

Nod to INDC Journal.
Goldberg makes a point that I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to make since Phil Collins was just Genesis&amp;rsquo;s drummer:
   What Maher, Raines, and Smiley fail to grasp is that all morality is based upon transcendence &amp;ndash; or it is merely based on utilitarianism of one kind or another, and therefore it is not morality so much as, at best, an enlightened expediency or will-to-power.</description>

Go. Please.
On election night, PBS commentator and anti-American Bill Moyers conjectured that, should Kerry win, there would be right-wing coup d&amp;rsquo;etat to overthrow the government. As is almost always the case when a liberal opens his mouth to speak, Bill Moyers was 180 degrees out.</description>

They think they, not the 58 million who voted for Bush, are the majority.
USA Today has given us a county-by-county map of the election. If I were a Blue American, I&amp;rsquo;d be worried.</description>

      <description>George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s achievement in the election of 2004 ranks as one of the greatest political achievements of a century.
Elected without a popular vote mandate in a contested election that was unsettled for six weeks, Bush began his first term at a sharp disadvantage. Liberals hated him, lambasting him as a buffoon, an idiot, a redneck moron from West Texas who was too stupid to tie shoes, much less run a country.</description>

My favorite posts, summarized:
 Everyone who voted for Bush is a toothless, SUV-driving, NASCAR-watching, illiterate who doesn&amp;rsquo;t deserve to vote America will become a 3rd world country Calling for boycotts of all American products by both Americans and everyone else in the world Begging Canada to annex the blue states. (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d stand in the way) Virtually hugs to liberals in red states who have to live amongst brain-dead idiots Hopes that radical Islamists will kill all American soldiers in the Middle East  Folks, these are the sentiments of the people we just defeated.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not buying the story that yesterday&amp;rsquo;s leaked, mid-day exit poll results were innocently in err. No way. They were intentionally skewed toward Kerry to discourage Bush votes in the afternoon and evening.
This was shameful. Again and again in this election, the MSM have used their power to influence the vote. Again and again, they were thwarted by the will of the people. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s have the will of the people dismantle the MSM.</description>

      <description>The networks and newspapers are not calling states they know Bush has won in order to not force Kerry to concede. As Jay Cost points out, this is disgraceful.
I will call it. Bush has now won Nevada, New Mexico, Iowa, and Ohio. He has won the popular vote. George W. Bush has been re-elected to a second term as President of the United States by the will of its free citizens.</description>

      <description>On most of the East Coast and Midwest. At the top of the hour, projections have Kerry up 77 to 66. South Carolina, Virginia, and North Carolina&amp;ndash;all states where Bush is almost certain to win&amp;ndash;are still not called.
Bush is leading among the votes counted in Ohio and Florida.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think it will be a long night. We should know something by 10:00 PM CST&amp;ndash;11:00 in the east. </description>

      <description>I understand caution, but South Carolina is going Bush. I get the feeling the networks are declaring the Palmetto State as &amp;ldquo;too close to call&amp;rdquo; to give Kerry hopefuls hope out West. </description>

      <guid>https://hennessysview.com/2004/11/01/election-prediction/</guid>
      <description>For what it&amp;rsquo;s worth&amp;ndash;this is my most optimistic guess:
Beginning with WSJ&amp;rsquo;s 216-203 Bush, I see the Toss Ups falling like this:
Bush 216 + 63 = 279 (winner)
Kerry 203 + 52 = 255 (loser)
Popular vote: Bush 50-Kerry 48-Nader/others &amp;lt;1.
Senate: GOP + 4
House: GOP + 4
Likely alternatiaves (in order of probability):
 Bush wins Florida Kerry wins Ohio Bush wins Pennsylvannia Kerry wins Minnesota Kerry wins Wisconsin Bush wins Michigan Kerry wins New Mexico Bush wins Hawaii  </description>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s OpinionJournal.com (Wall Street Journal), John Fund details recent AFL-CIO criminal activity aimed at intimidating Republicans in Missouri, Florida, and Michigan. I brought some of these stories to Dean&amp;rsquo;s World&amp;rsquo;s attention last week while this site was down.
What could be more demonstrative of the Democrat intellectualism than these stories. They send sub-human union neanderthals to smash up Republican campaign offices because they&amp;rsquo;re afraid of losing on merit. Then again, isn&amp;rsquo;t the purpose of unionism to eliminate merit-based rewards?</description>

      <description>Read for yourself. My headline is my judgement. (Thanks to Drudge)
Coupled with Howard Fineman&amp;rsquo;s assessment that the press has moral reasons to bury news that might help Bush, the conspiracy of the MSM against the president is more or less conceded by the conspirators themselves. Does anyone care?</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t see or hear the debate. Instead, I read bloggers&amp;rsquo; reactions this morning. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I found:
Instapundit&amp;rsquo;s concensus reading is the Bush won by fighting to a draw. After the president&amp;rsquo;s miserable performance in debate one, this makes some sense.
Andrew Sullivan called it a draw.
Dean&amp;rsquo;s World reviewers took the president.
The Corner, though, is the interesting one. Based on the times of the posts, I&amp;rsquo;d say that Bush was miserable for first 40 minutes or so.</description>

      <description>If Kerry has his way, the price of an abortion will increase dramatically, because Kerry wants the government to pay for them.
For years I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained that the ridiculous cost of a college class is the fault of the government&amp;rsquo;s insane college assistance program. Providing funding for the difference between what a student can afford and what a college charges is a salesman&amp;rsquo;s dream come true.
Imagine if the government did the same for homes.</description>

      <description>I turned my back to the darker world many years ago.
I trained my focus on lighter things and happier sounds.
I let myself laugh at things that I wouldnt have before.
I let myself cry when babies laughed or someone, with
Just the right inflection and sincerity, said, God Bless
America or Look at that rainbowthere.
But the darkness didnt turn its back on me, for sure.
Hes kept me in his gaze like a lions on a gazelle.</description>

      <description>John Edwards is a lightweight. He has called Cheney a liar twice, and Cheney has not responded. He needs to address this directly, firmly, and finally.
&amp;ldquo;Saddam Hussein needed to be confronted . . . it needed to be done the right way . . . now, remember, we went into Afghanistan . . . we had Osama bin Laden cornered . . . and what did the administration decide to do?</description>

      <description>Only the blindness of emotional loyalty would allow someone to watch the first of 3 presidential debates and conclude that President Bush demonstrated he was fit to run the country. As a partisan, I was embarrassed. It was as bad as Nixon&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;well, I&amp;rsquo;m not a crook&amp;rdquo; press conference. Bush didn&amp;rsquo;t look guilty of anything; he just didn&amp;rsquo;t look particularly interested. Like his father in 1992, Bush 43 had better things to do.</description>

The Germans, the French, as individual human beings, are inferior to Americans in most ways. They are inferior athletes, inferior writers, inferior scientists, inferior fighters. Except for whining, crying, and cowaring behind Uncle Sam&amp;rsquo;s red, white, and blue pants, I can&amp;rsquo;t think of anything the people in these two countries, and most of Europe, do better than Americans.</description>

      <description>In this front page NYTimes.com story, the paper argues that Democrats are pummelling Republicans in registering new voters in swing states, specifically, Florida and Ohio. Looking at the headline, one might conclude that Kerry is gaining momentum. If you read more, then do a little independent work, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to reach a different conclusion.
Okay, so the Democrats are better at getting people to register. No doubt. In St. Louis, Missouri, the Democrat machine is canvassing cemetaries all weekend.</description>

      <description>While only 8% of Republics are ashamed of their jobs. What other conclusion can we draw from the fact that, according to OpenSecrets.org, 1 in 4 donors to John Kerry&amp;rsquo;s campaign refuses to disclose his employer or occupation while 92% of Bush contributors proudly disclose theirs.
Under federal law, candidates and parties are required to make reasonable efforts to determine the occupation and employer of all contributors. While Republicans are frequently fined by the FEC for failing to identify the occupuations of 5-10% of donors, Democrats generally skate by with 15% non-disclosure with no fines.</description>

About the same time, some liberal mags were speculating that al Qaeda&amp;rsquo;s capacity to carry out spectacular acts of terrorism has been so greatly diminished that the Bush administration is being disingenuous by even mentioning the terrorism threat as a real risk.</description>

There is something chilling in reading this article top to bottom, perhaps more so because 1972 is the beginning of my political awakening.
My parents were naturally Democrats, and I grew up in the very Democrat, blue-collar neighborhood of Southwest St. Louis where Scullin Steel once cast a sulfur cloud shadow over the old frame houses built in the declining days of the Jazz Age.</description>

&amp;ldquo;In an effort to regain the trust of the American people CBS should not only investigate the process that led to the use of these documents but they should identify immediately those engaged in possible criminal activity who attempted to use a news organization to affect the outcome of a Presidential election in its closing days.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Professional Bush-hater and admitted liar, Bill Burkett, has hastened the departures of Dan Rather and John Kerry from the national scene.
On Saturday, Burkett says he provided &amp;ldquo;information&amp;rdquo; on Bush&amp;rsquo;s National Guard record to the Kerry campaign via former Sentator Max Cleland.  While Burkett did not specify what that information was, it is clear that it included the forged memos that, eventually, found their way to CBS and Dan Rather.</description>

      <description>The Gallup organization shows the President has a commanding 13-point lead in its latest poll of likely voters conducted in the past week. A Pew Research Group poll conducted during roughly the same period finds the race a dead heat at 46% to 46%.
The Gallup poll was conducted normally. The Pew people tried something new, by conducting the poll in two phases. Whether that accounts for the difference, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but somebody is wrong here.</description>

Sophia Parlock&amp;rsquo;s dad, Phil, brought to the Democrat event and gave her a Bush-Cheney sign to hold up at the end of the rally, after Edwards had spoken.
Union thugs set upon the family, forcibly ripping the signs from the children&amp;rsquo;s hands.</description>

      <description>There is no other way to describe CBS News. They have proven to have no concern whatsoever about journalism integrity. They clearly want only to defame President Bush and to sway the election in Kerry&amp;rsquo;s favor. As such, CBS News is now a mere parody of itself, The Onion Network.
I was opposed to Congressional investigations of the network. They&amp;rsquo;ve changed my mind. Let&amp;rsquo;s have the Justice Department and FCC dig in as well.</description>

      <description>After reading William Safire&amp;rsquo;s piece on CBS&amp;rsquo;s fraud, I am convinced that CBS will have to retract and apologize before the week is out. When your friends tell you it&amp;rsquo;s over, it&amp;rsquo;s over. Dan Rather is, right now, Richard Nixon being told he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the votes in the Senate to acquit.
What bothers me is how the MSM will treat Rather after he confesses. Instead of riding him out on a rail, he will be honored for his &amp;ldquo;remarkable courage.</description>

      <description>Having spent 9 years as a Personnel Officer in the Navy, I can tell you that the Sugar Coat memo is likely a fraud. In that memo, Killian supposedly writes to himself that hes going to give Bush no marks for the period, but Killian had no choice. Thats the way fitreps work.
When an officer is away from his permanent duty station for a significant period portion of the reporting period, the reporting senior must submit a &amp;ldquo;not observed&amp;rdquo; report.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy cleaning the house (Saturday is Field Day around the Hennessy house), but I have had time to look around and find:
  A retired Major General whom CBS News claimed corroborated the Killian memos says that CBS lied to him. According to ABC News, Maj. Gen Hodges, Killian&amp;rsquo;s supervisor at the time the memos were supposedly written, says that CBS told him that all of the memos were &amp;ldquo;hand written,&amp;rdquo; not typed.</description>

      <description>For many reasons, I decided that I would not actively work for the Bush campaign this year as I did in 2000. Those reasons are personal, so I won&amp;rsquo;t explain here.
However, after CBS collaborated with the Democrats to cheat by creating and airing fraudulant documents, I have no choice but to join the fight. I will be spending a lot of my spare time working for the campaign here on out, so my blog might go empty for a day here and there.</description>

      <title>Dan Rather Suicide Watch:  Day 1</title>

      <description>Senator John Kerry, when asked about Admirla Boorda&amp;rsquo;s suicide a few years back, commented that suicide is probably the appropriate response to disclosure that one knowingly wore military decorations not officially awarded.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure, then, that the Senator would agree that intentionally passing fraudulent documents as real in order to influence a presidential election is also grounds for suicide. Therefore, I am herewith launching the Dan Rather Suicide Watch.
Shortly, we&amp;rsquo;ll introduce contests for Pick the Time and Date, Pick the Method, and Write Dan&amp;rsquo;s Suicide Note which we&amp;rsquo;ll have certified as authentic by CBS&amp;rsquo;s own Marcel Matley.</description>

      <title>Dan Rather Source of Documents?</title>

      <description>Yesterday, I conjectured that Dan Rather fabricated the Bush ANG documents as a vendetta against the Bushes for 41&amp;rsquo;s undressing of Rather on the CBS Evening News in 1988&amp;ndash;the interview that turned the election in Bush&amp;rsquo;s favor. Apparently, I&amp;rsquo;m not alone. Here&amp;rsquo;s an interesting quote from Powerline:
 Last night, it was reported that senior executives at CBS News were promising an investigation. Today, Dan Rather is personally vouching for the documents&amp;rsquo; authenticity.</description>

      <description>Something on TimeIsAFactor.com caught my attention.
One of the 4 CBS memos about George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s National Guard service contains the following memo supposedly authored by his commanding officer:
&amp;ldquo;Bush wasn&amp;rsquo;t here during rating period and I don&amp;rsquo;t have any feedback from 187th in Alabama. I will not rate.&amp;rdquo;
Having spent 9 years as an enlisted Personnel Officer in the Navy, the marks on Bush&amp;rsquo;s fitness report for the period he was in Alabama are the only ones that could be entered.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that two of the document CBS aired were fraudulent. Assuming that CBS News retracts them on tonight&amp;rsquo;s Evening News (and there are indications that Dan Rather will make and on-air apology), George Bush will win the election in November with an 8% to 12% popular vote margin and at least 100 vote margin in the Electoral College.
Why? The law of increasing returns, also known a piling on.</description>

      <description>On the CBS Evening News tonight, Dan Rather lied about the reasons for questioning the authenticity of the National Guard documents he likely typed at home before cutting and pasting a dead man&amp;rsquo;s signature.
He claimed that doubters asserted that the CGTimes font &amp;ldquo;was not available&amp;rdquo; in the 1970s. No, Dan, no one&amp;rsquo;s claiming that. Typography experts are claiming, though, that the proportional font was not available on common typewriters in 1972.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: ArguingWithSignposts has some quotes from Democrat and CBS insiders indicating that both the Kerry campaign, which gave the memos to 60 Minutes, and CBS had doubts about their validity. Good analysis . . . take a read.
CBS News has launched an internal investigation into the validity of documents related to George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s National Guard service that it aired on 60 Minutes, according to Drudge. Other developments overnight seem to make it more likely than not that at least two of the documents were forgeries&amp;ndash;with Killian&amp;rsquo;s signature electronically placed on a memo fabricated by Democrat operatives, then fed to CBS News.</description>

&amp;ldquo;By now, there are many of us loyal Democrats who feel uncomfortable in seeing that you have chosen the rich over the poor, unilateral pre-emptive war over a strong nation united with others for peace, lies and obfuscation over the truth and the political technique of character assassination as a way to win elections or to garner a few moments of applause,&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>In 16 months of war, 1,000 brave Americans have given their lives so that filthy, vile creatures could travel to New York to spit, bleed, and deficate on Republicans. During that same period it is estimated by the Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and other organizations, that
 1,250 college-age men and women between 18 and 24 years of age died by suicide. 53,000 Americans were killed in highway accidents.</description>

      <description>Western, though not necessarily American, reporters ask Russian president Vladimir Putin on Monday why he hasn&amp;rsquo;t invited Chechen rebels to the Kremlin for a meeting on their disputes with Russia in the wake of the massacre last week. Putin&amp;rsquo;s answer was perfect.
&amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you have a meeting with bin Laden? Invite him to the White House? Can you imagine if people who shoot children in the head ever came to power anywhere in the world?</description>

      <description>The National Review Online has this excellent, anonymous piece by a self-described disgruntled Democrat who attempts to explain why Zell Miller is so angry. It&amp;rsquo;s great reading, because I remember my dad, a lifelong Democrat, becoming angry in 1972 and voting for Nixon. He went back (I think) the Democrats in 1976, but four years of Jimmy Carter has made him a permament Republican.
Bottom line is this: Democrats will sell out their country to win an election.</description>

In West Virginia, Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America, gave Kerry a rifle as a gift. Kerry, a self-described gun-owner and hunter, quipped: **&amp;ldquo;I thank you for the gift, but I can&amp;rsquo;t take it to the debate with me.</description>

      <description>Turns out the President was a pretty good pilot, particularly in the classroom. This is from MSNBC:
   The records also indicate that Bush made good grades, scoring an 88 on total airmanship and earning perfect 100s for flying without navigational instruments, operating a T-38 System and studying applied aerodynamics. Other scores ranged from 89 in flight planning to 98 in aviation physiology.
 The new records are consistent with the President&amp;rsquo;s long-standing assertion that he trained regularly until 1972 when transfered to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign.</description>

      <description>CNN, which downplayed polls by both Newsweek and Time, has announced THE OFFICIAL GEORGE W. BUSH CONVENTION BOUNCE . . . .
TWO PERCENT!!!!
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, George Bush&amp;rsquo;s convention earned him a smaller bounce than Kerry&amp;rsquo;s.
Interestingly, the 2 point bounce, according to the article on CNN.com, puts Bush at 52% to 45% for Kerry&amp;ndash;a seven point lead for Bush. I watch these polls, people, I can tell you that going into the convention, no on had Bush at 50%.</description>

      <description>Time and Newsweek polls released yesterday both show President Bush with an 11 point lead over challenger John Kerry. I know this because of www.drudgeport.com. I would never have known it looking at the major media websites.
CNN: Buried on politics page
MSNBC: Buried on politics page
Why do I single out these two? Because CNN and Time own a joint website, as do MSNBC and Newsweek. Basically, CNN and NBC refuse to report the results of their own polls because, like spoiled, petulant children, the polls don&amp;rsquo;t show what they want them to show.</description>

Amazon has suspended its rules of decorum for one book: Unfit for Command. The Amazon policy permits anyone to write anything about anyone&amp;ndash;short of profanity. Presumably, one can offer cash money for the assassination of the Swift Boat Veterans with Amazon&amp;rsquo;s ascent.

      <description>Looks like he&amp;rsquo;s tearing it up. So far, McCain, Guilliani, and Arnold have been the best 3 speeches I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen back-to-back-to-back at a political convention. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching these things since 1972.
Arnold, whom I laughed at when he announced his run for governor in California, is doing something no career politician could. He is doing what Reagan did in 1976. He is winning the convention.
Following on Monday&amp;rsquo;s performances, this is the most genuinely positive, upbeat GOP convention of my lifetime with the possible exception of 1984, when David Brinkley said of the conventioneers, &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re all so happy that can hardly stand it.</description>

USA Today July 26, 2000:
 [T]he contrast with Texas Gov. Bush could hardly be sharper. From the beginning, Bush has relied on a hometown trio: chief strategist Karl Rove, campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and communications director Karen Hughes. Despite little experience in presidential campaigns, they have moved through this year&amp;rsquo;s difficult GOP primaries and into the general election winning credit, by and large, for being sure-footed and tight-lipped.</description>

      <description>Howard Fineman used his blog to spin for Kerry today. If I had any money, I&amp;rsquo;d offer a reward to the first person to find this quote pertaining to Al Gore. Speaking of Kerry, Fineman writes:
   &amp;ldquo;He is fundamentally a loner and a thoughtful decision-maker &amp;ndash;sometimes too much so, which the Bush campaign translates as &amp;ldquo;uncertainty.&amp;rdquo; &amp;quot;
 Isn&amp;rsquo;t that EXACTLY what they said was wrong with Gore?</description>

      <description>Wow. What an airhead. I hope I don&amp;rsquo;t offend any lawyer friends, but Edwards strikes me as the worst of his breed: ambulance chasers. I&amp;rsquo;ll be he has more books on marketing legal services, maximizing profitability from a single client, and finding new avenues for class action suits than he has on actual law.
John Edwards is a shallow, empty man who, absent our current legal system, would sell junk bonds door to door making millions without a scrupple.</description>

      <description>I thought I was the only one who distrusts John McCain. (I have not trusted him since his attacks on Pat Buchanan in which McCain knowingly advanced phony charges that Buchanan was a Nazi sympathizer. McCain did so for his own purposes and permanently destroy my faith in his character.)
Apparently, though, there are quite a few people who have reservations about the one of the Keating Five who never seems to get a mention with that group.</description>

      <description>Turmoil in the Kerry campaign continues to get attention: me, Dan Rather, Howard Fineman, Al Hunt, and now PoliBlogger.
Links to other stories available here, here, and here 
Again, I&amp;rsquo;m amazed at the similarities between descriptions of Kerry&amp;rsquo;s campaign problems and Al Gore&amp;rsquo;s four years ago. I&amp;rsquo;m sure Al Hunt and Howard Fineman mean to help Kerry with their fond descriptions of his thinking skills, but they are setting him up for failure by raising the bar too high.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 35 days nine hours since my last smoke, and I&amp;rsquo;m craving them badly today. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to smoke in over 2 weeks.
I&amp;rsquo;ve saved $232.75, though, less about $95 for off-brand patches. I have to buy one more box of 7 mg patches, then I&amp;rsquo;m done. I&amp;rsquo;ll have a net savings of about $130 by the time my patches run out. Wahoo!</description>

      <description>Andrew Sullivan is sensing something that I&amp;rsquo;m sensing, too: things are moving, at least at the moment, in the President&amp;rsquo;s direction. I think the protesters are helping Bush far more than they&amp;rsquo;re hurting them, and Andrew has some other reasons:
   &amp;ldquo;In all this, you can almost feel the election swinging Bush&amp;rsquo;s way a little. The swift boat smear was important in jolting the conversation, in changing the dynamic that was pointing to a Bush defeat.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Dan Rather wrote on his blog that Democrats are becoming frustrated and disappointed with the Kerry campaign. As I noted earlier, there&amp;rsquo;s a feeling of a big Bush surge coming.
Now, Al Hunt, in today&amp;rsquo;s Wall Street Journal, writes of a &amp;ldquo;major shake-up&amp;rdquo; coming in the Kerry campaign. (Remember all of Al Gore&amp;rsquo;s shake-ups? Remember the contrast between Bush&amp;rsquo;s well-oiled machine with one man making quick decisions against Gore&amp;rsquo;s committee-driven, poll watching, risk averse blob?</description>

      <description>Michael Moore, the documentary-style film maker, gave birth to his fifth chin during the opening night of the Republican National Convention.
At 8 lbs., 4 oz. and 22 inches long, Al, as Moore has named him, is the largest of Moore&amp;rsquo;s many chins.
&amp;ldquo;One more and I start my own Chinese phone book,&amp;rdquo; the liberal icon quipped as paramedics strapped the undulating flesh to stretcher.</description>

      <description>The most pro-violent, anti-American, anti-Western protests since the 1970s has begun in New York. The protesters are there to wish death to the President of the United States and all support or tolerate him. Yet protesters, whose web pages and speeches are filled with violent, murderous mayhem, won&amp;rsquo;t do the deed themselves. While talking a good game, these unemployed, over-educated, unbathed, nasty excuses for human beings are, in fact, cowards. They confront their enemies only in large numbers and with the protection of police, whom they claim to despise.</description>

Guests (aka, donors) will praise Bill and Hillary while handing $10,000 checks to so-called 527 organizations&amp;ndash;DNC organs invented by Russ Feingold as the &amp;ldquo;switch&amp;rdquo; part of the bait and switch of the recently enacted Campaign Finance Reform act.
Sen. John McCain, the man who seems to make a living of getting hoodwinked by Democrats, now wants the 527 outlawed.</description>

      <description>This letter, published in NRO, is from an officer who was onboard the swiftboat the night of December 2-3, 1968 when Kerry claims to have been wounded under fire.
This letter is significant because Kerry&amp;rsquo;s defenders have claimed since the outset that none of the SwiftVets ever served onboard Kerry&amp;rsquo;s boat. The author of this letter was the Officer in Charge of the swiftboat that night&amp;ndash;Kerry&amp;rsquo;s senior officer who would have had to have signed the award recommendation.</description>

      <description>I have never studied linguistics, and the fact that Noam Chomsky made it his career before he set out to destroy Western Civilization, pretty much guarantees that I never will study it. But I think I have a sense of language and its effect on people. I pay attention to the evolution of words&amp;rsquo; meanings. I like the way words affect the human mind and emotions. I like metaphor and simile and hyperbole&amp;ndash;not to be clever, but to actually color a reader&amp;rsquo;s mood the way tiny drop of dye colors an entire bucket of milk.</description>

      <description>A herd of &amp;ldquo;scientists&amp;rdquo; recently gathered in Sweden to announce a new geological era, Anthropocene, which is man&amp;rsquo;s final destruction of the rest of the planet. These assembled idiots, embarrassments to whatever colleges granted them degrees, gave as an example of &amp;ldquo;catastophic&amp;rdquo; changes caused by man, sand churned up by SUVs and ATVs. Yes, dust churned up in the Sahara.
Of course, these mice of science lack any actual numbers. Were they to study their own fields, they&amp;rsquo;d learn that the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 released approxomately 11 cubic miles of dust into the atmosphere, creating a mini-nuclear winter in New York, some 6,000 miles away.</description>

      <description>Jim Lacey, in National Review Online, makes some excellent points about the same thing I&amp;rsquo;ve wondered for some time: where are all the terrorists?
After we invaded Afghanistan, we were told that tens of thousands of well-trained fanatics were scattered around the globe, increasing their danger and allowing them to recruit more members.
Well, three years later, where are they? Why haven&amp;rsquo;t they struck?
Mr. Lacey&amp;rsquo;s article is well worth reading as explores some possible answers to these questions.</description>

   It&amp;rsquo;s bad enough that we couldn&amp;rsquo;t mourn our dead then. Now we see the same man that stood over the open graves of our brothers and pissed on their bodies is back.

      <description>Everyone knows that John F. Kerry refuses to allow anyone to view any part of his official military records. The Truth Laid Bear blog has found another Kerry cover-up: his contributors list.
Even though federal election law requires that candidates for all public office publicize their contributor list and how much each contributor gives, Kerry considers himself above the law. Bush, whose military records are public record, lists almost 100% of his contributors, while Kerry&amp;rsquo;s disclosure rate is in the mere 70s.</description>

      <description>Rush Limbaugh started down this path on radio last week, but Christopher Hitches beautifully finishes the job in Slate, brought to my attention by Poliblog.
A logical person&amp;ndash;a professor of philosophy, let&amp;rsquo;s say, or math&amp;ndash;mush cringe trying to defend Kerry&amp;rsquo;s arguments that his service in Vietnam makes him more deserving of the office of the President of the United States than its current occupant. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:
Kerry and most Democrats consider the US to be the bad guys in Vietnam, and the US military the perpetrators of wrong for the advance of evil.</description>

      <description>Oil output is up and demand is down. The reasonable price for oil is about $35.00/bbl. based on historic supply and demand balances. But reason has been thrown to the wind by a combination of pessimism, panic, stupidity, and hardy greed. The best way to punish the stupid and mean is to greatly reduce consumption. Here&amp;rsquo;s some easy ways.
  Tax-free days for telecommuting. Absolve employers of all payroll tax burdens on a day-for-day basis for employees who work from home.</description>

      <description>Just when I was ready to hand the election to Kerry thanks to the SwiftVets, the DNC makes me look stupid. I had no idea that they would do something as stupid as waste an entire Sunday trying to convince people that George W. Bush ghost-wrote the SwiftVets book, but that&amp;rsquo;s just what they did.
Stupid, stupid Democrats. You were winning this one, you morons! Instead of being &amp;ldquo;presidential&amp;rdquo; and adult about it by having Kerry merely respond, &amp;ldquo;My record in the Navy is my record in the Navy,&amp;rdquo; you send out drooling attack dogs like Tad Divine to lie about Bush&amp;rsquo;s personal involvement.</description>

      <description>A powerful union allowed to run amok in the St. Louis area&amp;rsquo;s fire protection district has made a lot of firefighters rich. It&amp;rsquo;s a little frustrating that the firemen in the safest districts seem to make the most money. It&amp;rsquo;s more alarming that a district that was better paid than any area union district unionized last year. That will only drive up the cost of fire protection for everyone. As with so many unions, expect this story in the St.</description>

      <description>The swift boat veterans who penned the anti-Kerry book have accomplished two things: made themselves look petty and made John Kerry look strong.
Hey, amateur politicians: Never give your opponent the opportunity to take a stand in defense of himself, his family, or his military service.
Kerry got no bounce from the DNC convention, but he will get 10 points from the swiftvets by this time next week. Bush will be down 12 when the GOP convention begins thanks to amateur political hacks who thought they could help their candidate.</description>

      <description>The last time an American girl won the Olympic Gold Medal for All-Around in gymnastics, a Republican president won re-election in a landslide against a liberal Democrat from Massecheusetts.
With the GOP convention around the corner, Kerry&amp;rsquo;s bounce (or whatever he got from the DNC convention) is gone&amp;ndash;Bush and Kerry are dead even. Reagan was only slightly ahead of Mondale at this point in 1984, when Mary Lou became the first American to win the Olympic all-around.</description>

Ted Rall is a liar who lies to promote his personal goal of inciting a violent overthrow of the United States government so he and George Soros can impose a Stalinist state. They are, after all, working communists committed to fulfilling Lenin&amp;rsquo;s dream.
But that&amp;rsquo;s just my opinion, as Dennis Miller days; I could be wrong. </description>

 What goes into the site? What main tabs? What sub tabs? What security roles? What can each security role see and do?  In other words, basic site design and flow.
In almost every site I&amp;rsquo;ve designed, I&amp;rsquo;ve begun down the wrong path. I don&amp;rsquo;t get far, mind you, but I always start off the wrong way.</description>

      <description>Howard Dean assists terrorism. The New York Times assists terrorism. MSNBC, CBS, ABC, and CNN support terrorism.
Most people understand this conceptually, but we haven&amp;rsquo;t had any hard proof. Until now.
Since last Saturday when Tom Ridge held a press conference to announce that 5 specific building and other unspecified buildings were targets of on-going Qaeda planning, the liberals herein mentioned, plus their Amen Corner in every city coffee shop and faculty lounge in the county, accused the Bush administration of fabricating the evidence in order to boost the President&amp;rsquo;s poll ratings.</description>

Whatever funding the Bush Administration hasn&amp;rsquo;t cut off from terrorists will now be redirected to the Kerry campaign. Either way, the terrorists lose their money.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The administration was obviously right to warn the country that Al Qaeda had apparently studied financial institutions in three cities with the idea of a possible attack.&amp;rdquo;
That&amp;rsquo;s from the newspaper that only Tuesday declared that George Bush made up the terror alert just to win votes.
The New York Times, its editors, and everyone who bought the political theory of the terror alert are un-American.</description>

      <description>Why beat around the bush, so to speak. If you think the Administration invented the terror alert for 5 buildings in order to boost the President&amp;rsquo;s re-election chances, you are un-American.
Should terrorism strike between now and the election, they will either claim that the GOP coordinated the attack (no doubt designed to kill Democrats in key voting districts), or blame the Administration for failing to protect us. The media will oblige them&amp;ndash;on both counts.</description>

      <description>Okay, I know I&amp;rsquo;m risking looking like an idiot, but I&amp;rsquo;ll predict (with 16% of the precincts reporting) that Claire McCaskill will win the Democrat Gubernatorial primary in Missouri, defeating a failed, one-term governor who won primarily because his predecessor died a month before the election.
Bob Holden was a disaster as governor. He was outwitted by the Republican House Speaker at every turn. He seemed petty and unprepared for the office.</description>

      <description>You have selected the better candidate for governor. Why does a Republican care? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m also a Missourian. I must remind myself: What if the Democrat wins? On the chance that the next Missouri governor is a Democrat, I have to side with the best Democrat available. That may not be Claire McKaskill, but it sure as hell isn&amp;rsquo;t Bob Holden.
Whoever wins the general election, Missouri&amp;rsquo;s next governor will be better than its current one.</description>

Howard Dean had all of the money, all of the liberal pundits, all of the liberal media, and all of the DNC on his side going into Iowa. His message earned him not a single delegate until the Vermont primary, where he won 18 votes to 14.

John Kerry truly believes we should never had launched a war on terrorism. He&amp;rsquo;s not backing down on that stand.

&amp;ldquo;I think the American people are a heck of a lot smarter than some of these politicians and political consultants think they are,&amp;rdquo; Kerry told a recent, all-Democrat audience.
Mr. Kerry failed to tell them that he thinks Americans are too stupid to save for their own retirement, to decide how much to spend on medical care, to decide which cars to drive, to decide where to live, to decide where to send their children to school.</description>

      <description>A union is trying to organize Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s programmers. The union is exploiting fear of off shoring to rally the workers.
Having worked in software engineering for a decade, but observed the utility of unions over 40 years, I strongly urge Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s employees to do some long, hard thinking before they sign up with the labor group.
Unions have been completely unable to stop off shoring in every industry they&amp;rsquo;ve tried. In fact, in steel, garments, and shoes, union activity accelerated the rates of job moves to overseas companies by making American workers more of a headache and more expensive.</description>

Friday night before the curtain felt like an opening. I was nervous. I thought back to my first play at DB: Blythe Spirit. In my first scene my character sipped a martini. On opening night, I was so nervous that the water&amp;rsquo;s surface looked like what I what later see from the bridge of a submarine: rolling waves breaking into white caps.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I started crying.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I saw how much you love being on stage, and I was overwhelmed by how good this show is . . . and how good you are. I was just . . . I was afraid I&amp;rsquo;d started gasping.&amp;rdquo;
That&amp;rsquo;s the effect you had on my wife opening night.
She&amp;rsquo;s not just a biased family member in the audience. She&amp;rsquo;s an accomplished dancer and theatre major who&amp;rsquo;s seen more than her share of plays.</description>

      <description>23 years ago, I met Joe DiMercurio at auditions for his People&amp;rsquo;s Players production of Sound of Music. Over the next four years, he became one of my closest friends, particularly on stage.
Last night, after the thrill of a wonderful opering night, still buzzing from the excitement and the energy of the play, I found out that my haste in producing the program resulted in my omitting one of my best friend&amp;rsquo;s biography.</description>

      <description>So, last night was Opening Night&amp;hellip;
I personally thought it went GREAT! The audience was very receptive&amp;ndash;laughing and clapping when and where they should have. (And not being shy about it.) I THINK this is accurate information, but I heard that we started a few minutes late because we still had a line out the door for tickets at 7:30. (?) And that, save for 9 tickets, we were sold out (?</description>

      <description>One seminal moment can so focus the mind that the thing that should be central slides to the periphery.
Mr. L surprised me with &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s say a prayer.&amp;rdquo;
Instantly, I remembered the routine practiced by every Catholic sports team, speech club, and theatre cast and crew before any important event: hands lain upon hand, bodies pressed against bodies, some stretching to reach, others bowing to accommodate. All together for one moment, humbly before God and man, asking for His blessing on what we are about to do.</description>

      <description>I personally felt that final tech did exactly what I thought it would do&amp;ndash;everything came together. Sure, there were a few final snags to be ironed out, many notes taken by Mr. L, but that&amp;rsquo;s just standard procedure. Commenting on Bill&amp;rsquo;s blog, when I heard &amp;ldquo;Bust your buns&amp;rdquo;, it had been wayyyy too long since I heard that before a show. Before every community theatre show I&amp;rsquo;ve done though, I have found a quiet secluded spot for myself, and I have prayed and recited that &amp;lsquo;pre-game&amp;rsquo; ritual that I prayed and recited before every show I was in or worked on at DuBourg.</description>

      <description>Well last night was certainly a long night&amp;hellip;which was to be expected. I can not believe we open tomorrow night! It just completely blows my mind!
I was looking around last night at everyone in their full costumes, make-up, wigs, hair, etc. and it was just amazing&amp;ndash;everything and everyone looks so fun and awesome!
I do have to admit, though, I am starting to freak out a little bit. I mean, I know everything will come together by Wednesday night&amp;ndash;as it always has&amp;ndash;but I still get paranoid before a show.</description>

NYT: Do you have any gay friends?
WFB: I once said, commenting on the revised estimate of the number of gays in the U.S. from Kinsey&amp;rsquo;s 10 percent to the corrected figure, &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;If there are only 2.5 percent gays in America, I know them all.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;

      <description>Well done? Ha! The set looks . . . Magnificent!
Today, we make history. We use the Green Room for the first time. My Guild training paid off when I was in college. When I first saw the big green room below the stage at Fontbonne, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to be able to sit and relax between scenes. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it. I was so used to being in the wings when not on, I was afraid that I&amp;rsquo;d &amp;ldquo;lose&amp;rdquo; something being in a bright, comfortable, climate-controlled room, listening to the play over crackling speakers.</description>

      <description>Senator John Kerry turned down White House offers to receive briefings on the current terror risk assessment because he was too busy.
Last night on CNN&amp;rsquo;s Larry King Live, Kerry had this exchange (from Drudge):
   KING: News of the day, Tom Ridge warned today about al Qaeda plans of a large-scale attack on the United States. Didn&amp;rsquo;t increase the &amp;ndash; you see any politics in this? What&amp;rsquo;s your reaction?</description>

      <description>At a rally after announcing his pick for Veep, Senator John Kerry listed the things that make the Democrat ticket a better choice than the current administration. His final, and presumably, most important point:
&amp;ldquo;And we have better hair. And that goes a long way.&amp;rdquo;
Perhaps if the Senator wishes us to take him seriously as a presidential candidate, he should put down the mirror, stop kissing his VP nominee, and attend the terror assessment briefings offered by the White House.</description>

Almost immediately, evil bastards in the DNC and their minions in the press began a whipering campaign that Ridge was making up these reports in order draw attention away from John Kerry&amp;rsquo;s campaign.</description>

You might be doing this for yourself, but your dedication is such a gift to all the rest of us who went into it for OURselves. There is nothing better than being a part of a great team, is there? There&amp;rsquo;s something masturbatory about individual accomplishments.

We worked and re-worked that d*mn thing soo many times, but it helped sooo much!

Sitting on the floor, watching the others work, hearing Jim breathe a deeper, more coordinated life into characters, was a beautiful thing to observe. While we all know OUR motivations and worries, the director&amp;rsquo;s vision is the one that counts&amp;ndash;it turns isolated characters into related beings.</description>

Quindlen is worried that these Republicans are too damn manly for the good of the country.</description>

This magazine, which I have long respected and often hated, has now made itself fit to stand beside The National Enquirer and the World News.

      <description>Drudge and Bloomberg got it. The Wall Street Journal, MSNBC, CNN, all hid it. FoxNews.com buried it below the fold. What is it?
US Jobless Claims Fall to Lowest Level Since 2000
There number of new claims for unemployment benefits fell, last week, by 39,000 to a four-year low. Yet all of the liberal media buried the story. Why? Because good economic news hurts Kerry&amp;rsquo;s chances of election, and the primary goal of the major news media in the US is to get him elected.</description>

I hope we have more spine than Spain. I hope the attack, should it materialize, will galvanize America&amp;rsquo;s resolve to carry the Bush Doctraine to it&amp;rsquo;s limits.</description>

At the risk of sounding sappy, sentimental, etc. (which really is NOT me at all&amp;ndash;maybe deep down, but not a side I generally show to lots of people.), I need to explain some things:

Until rehearsals began, we spent so much time together. We rarely go out, nor do we entertain a lot. With five kids, those things are just out of the question.</description>

He and his colleagues at the Institute for Astronomy in Zurich have discovered that sun spot activity&amp;ndash;which has been measured since 1610 and can be reliable tracked for a thousand years before that&amp;ndash;has a powerful influence on the earth&amp;rsquo;s temperatures.
Moreover, the sun, they&amp;rsquo;ve found, has been more active in the past 60 years&amp;ndash;which coincides with &amp;ldquo;global warming&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;than any time in the past 1,000 years.

  I spent 24 out of 38 hours working in my family room (and, no, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Godfather maration). I painted, ripped out the carpet, and put in laminate flooring that looks wonderful. In the process, I re-routed some cables and forget to reconnect them until Monday morning.</description>

      <description>The good news is that the economy added 112,000 new jobs in June. The bad news is that that figure is less than half of what economists expected. More bad: manufacturing lost jobs.
Personally, I was stunned by the news. The month when kids get out of school for the summer, resorts increase staff for vacation season, etc., should have seen a big number. I was siding with the more optimistic economists expecting 300,000+ new jobs.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Dean&amp;rsquo;s World for finding this.
Is it any surprise, really? I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed the press handling things this way for some time: First, put out a story that is mostly false by using some legitimate source&amp;rsquo;s name without really revealing what that source said. Let the story (that reinforces the press&amp;rsquo;s prejudices) fester for awhile. Finally, to maintian their own legitimacy, quietly leak the real story. That way, editors can tell Tim Russert or Marvin Kalb, &amp;ldquo;We published the entirety of the commission&amp;rsquo;s finding.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s something worth reading and pondering. 
Hat tip to Professor Bainbridge.
Too many Christians rely on the writings of modern scholars who, 200 years from now, may or may not be valid. We just don&amp;rsquo;t know. We do know, however, that Augustine and Aquinas remain valid. Trust the ancients for they have withstood the test of time. </description>

      <description>Once upon a time, when I was young and naive, I would have thought such a statement by a mass murderer would only help George Bush. But the attitudes of my fellow Americans, led by the cowardly liar Michael Moore (please sue me) has hardened my opinion of my neighbors. My guess is that this evening&amp;rsquo;s talk shows will host more than a few &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; pundits who will claim Saddam&amp;rsquo;s indictment of Bush proves Moore&amp;rsquo;s case&amp;ndash;that Bush is in fact a criminal.</description>

      <description>This forum provides neither the time nor the space for one to adequately thank, or even mention, all of the debts owed William F. Buckley Jr. He holds markers for the world, the country, journalism, conservatism, and me and millions like me. Thankfully, Buckley&amp;rsquo;s collection methods are, at most, mild, like his disposition.
I have been in a room with Mr. Buckley but once, and it remains one of the highlights of my life.</description>

      <description>Even as gasoline prices continue to fall, I am furious about the synchronization of traffic signals in my part of the world.
Once upon a time, municipalities synchronized traffic signals so that a vehicle moving at or about the speed limit would be stopped by a red light very infrequently, usually once while on that particular road. Apparently, St. Louis County, Missouri has abandoned that practice.
Last night, I had to stop for 7 of 9 signals in a 4 mile stretch approaching my home.</description>

      <description>Yeah, we were all on pins and needles, weren&amp;rsquo;t we? Speaking in San Francisco, CA, the New York Senator affirmed the most basic belief of liberalism: educated elites know better what&amp;rsquo;s good for you than you do, and they will use the full power of the US government to force you to comply with their plans.
&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good,&amp;rdquo; she said.</description>

      <description>The 9th Circuit&amp;rsquo;s ruling held that the federal marijuana laws did not apply to medicinal use of marijuana in two specific cases. As you should know, the Constitution prohibits Congress from making laws on matters that lie outside its enumerated powers, which are very limited. One of those powers, though, known as the commerce clause, gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. The commerce clause has become the conduit for Congressional abuse of the states and of the people.</description>

      <description>And comes away disappointed. In his review of Fahrenheit 9/11, Christopher Hitchens explains his longtime craving for liberal version of Firing Line (William F. Buckley&amp;rsquo;s long running discussion show on CBS and PBS), or even a liberal Rush Limbaugh. He hoped it would be Michael Moore.
Then he saw the movie:
   To describe this film as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability.</description>

      <description>What can you learn from a serial killer? It&amp;rsquo;s up to you, but David Berkowitz&amp;rsquo;s musings are worth reading.
I was in grade school when the Son of Sam murders captivated the country&amp;rsquo;s imagination. It was an odd time in my life. Saturday Night Live was the most talked about television show. America, by and large, had decided to put Watergate and Vietnam onto the backburner. We were ready to laugh.</description>

For one week, we took the full measure of a great man who lived in our lifetimes: a man who strode across history&amp;rsquo;s plane with steps that challenged, but didn&amp;rsquo;t surpass, the founders. We needed to cry, to laugh, to reflect on a life well-lived. And we did.</description>

      <description>Reading reminders of the hatred for Ronald Reagan (now the most beloved former president in US history), offers a lesson for President Bush and the American people.
During his administration, Reagan repeatedly did what he felt was right or necessary at the expense of his personal and political popularity. He was truly hated in Europe and in American institutions of higher learning. Yet his confident and brave pursuit of good won both the political and the moral battles of the time and of history.</description>

      <description>A foul and acrid odor greets the nose
and violates the shirt, the pant, the underwear
for hours, days, weeks, unwashed.
Plastic flip-top lid conceals
the quartered fruit, so dry
and old, unworthy of gin or tongue.
Tired, sad, bilirubin-stained faces
surround the parallelogram
giving more than they receive
and much less than they asked for.
Age marked in hollows, dents, and chips.
Laughters, hard and coarse, rise above
the jukebox boom of same old songs</description>

      <title>Writing Doomed?</title>

      <description>Julia Smillie wonders if technology and blogging has doomed writers.
 Mediocre writing always had a following, even though it didn&amp;rsquo;t transcend eras. Good writing still sells and IS read, while bad writing sells and sits. When I first started trying to get published in the 1980s, I read The Writer and Writer&amp;rsquo;s Digest religiously. Almost every issue contained at least one column or article that said this exact same thing.</description>

      <description>I recently had an experience with a social services agency that paints an unfriedly face for the organization.
Almost Home, run by the Franciscan Sisters of St. Mary, provides teen mothers with the chance to make a better life for themselves and their children. In exchange for going to school, remaining free from drugs, establishing the norms of social achievement (job, daycare, financial assistance, child-rearing skills, etc.), the women and their babies have a safe, comfortable place to live, help with their children, etc.</description>

      <description>Why can they not even send a simple acknowledgement? Don&amp;rsquo;t they realize that a woman with a college degree wants to take a pay cut to work a nasty job helping society&amp;rsquo;s most vulnerable people, it&amp;rsquo;s a compliment? I even sent Target gift cards to the center so some of the young women could buy small gifts for their kids, or something for themselves.
The response from Almost Home&amp;rsquo;s communication director was shockingly cold, impersonal, and sarcastic:</description>

      <description>With that, the guards silently beckoned me to turn. The room was large and dark. Overhead lights illuminated the oracle on her seat and spilled onto the guards, but the rest of the room was invisible. Before me lay large double doors. I could see light fighting to enter around the great doors&amp;rsquo; edges. As I walked toward the light, the doors began to open slowly, admitting more light. I could see that pottery and artifacts stood on display pedestals all around the room, whose charcoal gray ceiling stood at least forty feet above me.</description>

      <description>Over on The Corner is a raging debate about the origin and meaning of the term Neo-Conservative. I am very rarely critical of anything National Review and its people do, but I have to criticize this conversation: no one cares. The world view NR and her readers and advocates as conservatives. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t separate Buchanan from Goldberg. And we conservative, including those of us who formerly wrote for NR on CompuServe, couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less.</description>

      <description>Can anyone look upon the fading figure of John Kerry without feeling a sense of pity as for a man who&amp;rsquo;s lost his family and home? His serious face, always looking a bit pained with concern, now expresses a sad displeasure for life itself. To make matters worse, Howard Dean, the child politician &amp;ndash; childlike in size, bearing, countenance, temperament, mentality, and world view &amp;ndash; has not only stolen Kerry&amp;rsquo;s media-given title of Man to Beat, he has now taken Kerry&amp;rsquo;s Biblical allusion: Job.</description>

      <description>The National Education Association, perhaps America&amp;rsquo;s most active liberal political action committee, continues to decry the No Child Left Behind law. The NEA&amp;rsquo;s chief complaints seem to be * It costs too much money * It set the bar too high * Its timeline is too aggressive * It encourages teachers to teach children to pass tests
My questions to the NEA are * How much money would satisfy your insatiable greed?</description>

      <description>ProfessorBainbridge.com reports that the doctor may have an insider trading scandal to deal with. Keeping score, Dean is now a hypocrite on: * Dean wants the Bush administration to release minutes of meetings with energy executives, but he refuses to release minutes of his meetings with energy executives. * Dean wants religion divorced from politics, but he wants to talk about what a bang-up Christian he is while campaigning in the South.</description>

      <description>Hey, I think I was too quick to judge the Dean on Religion article in the Washington Post. I felt that the reporter, Jim VandeHei, was soft on Dean and failed to analyze or even characterize the veracity of the doctor&amp;rsquo;s statements on religion. Having re-read the article, I have a new perspective. (Hey, I&amp;rsquo;ve been celebrating the holidays, and the mind isn&amp;rsquo;t quite up to full speed.)
VandeHei has done a hatchet job to Dean.</description>

      <description>I found this on Drudge. I offer a contrarian explanation, however. Perhaps the feminization of men&amp;ndash;mandatorily sitting to urinate in pre-schools, supporting Howard Dean&amp;ndash;is reducing the amount of testosterone men produce. I&amp;rsquo;d like to see a study that measures the sperm count in deficient men before and after a weekend movie marathon of The Godfather I and II, Patton, Braveheart, The Patriot (Mel Gibson&amp;rsquo;s), and Band of Brothers (all 10 episodes).</description>

      <description>We know that Dean has a problem with his handling of security and safety failures at Vermont&amp;rsquo;s only nuclear power plant. Dean&amp;rsquo;s World has an excellent point.
Combine the Yankee Power/Homeland Security issue with Dr. Dean&amp;rsquo;s secret energy policy meetings, and you begin to see that money talks with the good doctor, as does he from both sides of his mouth.
Also, have you noticed that the big magazines, Time and Newsweek, are starting to question the Dean phenomenon?</description>

      <description>No, it&amp;rsquo;s not about football.
  Howard Dean isn&amp;rsquo;t an idiot, according to Andrew Sullivan. He&amp;rsquo;s a doctor, dictator, refuses to be challenged or questioned, has no peers, likes to tell people what to do, right or wrong, and let the patient suffer the consequences of his errors.
  PoliBlog.com has an interesting piece on Dean and Job.

      <description>From the Washington Post:
 &amp;ldquo;I am still learning a lot about faith and the South and how important it is,&amp;rdquo; said Dean, a Congregationalist. The Congregationalist Church is a Christian denomination that preaches a personal relationship with God without a strong hierarchal structure guiding it. Dean was reared an Episcopalian, but left the church 25 years ago in a dispute with a local Vermont church over efforts to build a bike path.</description>

      <description>The Democrats have a real dilemma: Dean is seen by more and more people as both a shameless opportunist and a man who can&amp;rsquo;t speak straight. Making mistakes of fact at a pace of three a week, he runs the risk of looking significantly less intellectually vigorous than President Bush&amp;ndash;something most people thought unthinkable a few months ago. Is it any wonder that Kerry, Gephardt, and the rest of the Democrat field are scared of Dean?</description>

      <description>As governor of Vermont, Howard Dean repeatedly ignored warnings that his state was unprepared for a potential nuclear problem involving the Yankee Nuclear Power Plant and that security at the plant was unacceptable.
According to the Associated Press, Dean, who criticizes the Bush Administration&amp;rsquo;s war on terror nearly every day, underfunded critical programs to secure the nuclear plant even after September 11.
 &amp;ldquo;During Dean&amp;rsquo;s final year in office in 2002, an audit concluded that despite a decade of repeated warnings of poor safety at Vermont Yankee, Dean&amp;rsquo;s administration was poorly prepared for a nuclear disaster,&amp;rdquo; the AP story said</description>

On December 28, I decided to see which of my neighbors might be hosting a Dean house party. Like Lizza, I was curious and wanted to attend one as a non-Deaniac observer. While Lizza, who lives in the DC area, had about 30 parties to choose from, pickings were slim in St.</description>

      <description>Deaniacs send money to the Dean campaign whenever there&amp;rsquo;s a negative story about their candidate. (The fact that this method raised $15 million in three months says something about Dean, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what.) I propose that readers donate $5.00 to this blog every time Dr. Dean says something stupid. The money will be used to improve the site, allow me more time to research and write, and, if Dean remains on the front pages until November, let me retire a wealthy man this time next year.</description>

I would add my own rebuttal to Dean&amp;rsquo;s comments, but between Kaus&amp;rsquo;s analysis and Dean&amp;rsquo;s own political stupidity and pathological carelessness, I really can&amp;rsquo;t make this any more damaging to the good doctor&amp;rsquo;s faultering reputation.</description>

Manufacturing grew at its fastest pace in 20 years (since the Reagan administration) in December.
Hiring will pick up in 2004 according to economists, with unemployment dropping .5% to 5.5% by November (as per my 2004 Predictions).
Stock markets are up across the board, with Dow and NASDAQ safely above 10000 and 2000, respectively.</description>

      <description>Steve Moore of the Club for Growth has an excellent analysis of Howard Dean&amp;rsquo;s proposed tax increases. An excellent summary:
_The Dean plan, our ad notes, would raise taxes by $2,472 a year on a typical middle-income family of four. Mr. Dean would also raise the death tax rate, the capital gains tax rate, the dividend tax rate and the payroll tax, and he would bring back the hated marriage tax penalty that President Bush abolished this year.</description>

      <description>It is easy to get young people riled up, as William F. Buckely points out. The Dean house parties, rallies, $2 donations, etc., are the kinds of things young people like to do. And there is no doubt that Dean has energized a particular demographic group, namely, the 18- to 24-year-old folk.
Last week, Dr. Dean warned the DNC chairman that, if the other Democrat candidates don&amp;rsquo;t stop attacking Dean, Dean&amp;rsquo;s supporters might not vote at all come November 2004.</description>

      <description>The New Year begins with&amp;ndash;guess what&amp;ndash;Howard Dean saying something stupid. Thankfully, John F**ing Kerry has called him on it.
Dean&amp;rsquo;s inability to research his statements before making them&amp;ndash;like finding out how Kerry voted&amp;ndash;makes you wonder what kind of a doctor he was. Did he prescribe medication before checking the patient&amp;rsquo;s allergies? Did he prescribe procedures without determining if that procedure remained the recommended treatment? In other words, was he as intellectually lazy as a physician as he is as a politician?</description>

      <description>With the possible exception of phrenology, nothing has produced more false, even fraudulent science than has environmentalism. Scientists of various sorts with otherwise solid credentials have, for years, allowed their own political biases bastardize results of scientific inquiry in order to &amp;ldquo;prove&amp;rdquo; what is not provable or lacks valid scientific evidence.
Moreover, people, particularly procreative baby boomers and the generation that followed, believes such nonsense without critical questioning. Author Michael Crichton, himself an environmentalist and scientist, has had enough.</description>

      <description>Saddam&amp;rsquo;s capture pushed the Asian and European markets up consistently and strongly, between 1% and 3.5% for all the majors. But in America, people who buy and sell stock are the strangest creatures on earth, and clearly the most in need of instant gratification. From way up to barely a blip, as greedy bastards in $7,000 suits sell, sell, sell at tiny margins to &amp;ldquo;lock in their profits.&amp;rdquo;
What a joke.</description>

      <description>If it is, it always was
And once it is, it
Must be always.

      <description>Wildwood, MO—A Wildwood man is disappointed that a home improvement project proved more difficult than expected.
William Hennessy began a project to remove wallpaper and paint the master bedroom in his house in the Westglen Farms subdivision in Wildwood. Shortly after starting the job, he learned that, what he expected to take to hours, would take more than a day.
“According to the guy at Home Depot, this was a slam dunk,” said the unemployed software architect.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow our nation commemorates the 30th anniversary of judicial activisms most ignoble achievement.
Back in 1973, I remember my father coming home from his monthly Mens Club meeting at Epiphany of Our Lord Catholic Church in St. Louis with tears still streaking down his cheeks. Being the kind of man he is, he tried to hide them from the kids. I cant believe I fought two wars for this country, only to have those bastards send us all to hell, he told my mother in the kitchen.</description>
