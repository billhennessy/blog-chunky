Do you want to show the world your colors?
Do you want to say, “I’m a tea partier?”
Do you want your style to shout, “FREEDOM!”
Then get to the official St. Louis Tea Party store and stock up. We’ve added T.E.A. ball caps to go with the T.E.A Special Forces t-shirts (our best seller).
You’ll look terrific reading Zen Conservatism in your Tea Party Hoodie!

I began this book in December 2008, just after the election. My goal was to produce a book that would inspire people to restore our republic. At the time, conservatives were disheartened, dismayed, and distracted.
Then the Tea Party movement began, and I had to put my book project on hold. But thanks to your work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to return to my project.

                John is a Vietnam veteran and retired business executive. He loves America and hates to see what’s happened in Washington the past few years. He believes in liberty and Constitutional limitations on government growth.
He called the Tea Party just to vent and to see if it’s just him.
Recently, John had called Senator Kit Bond’s (R-MO) office in Washington. He wanted to know whether stories that Bond had signed off a $659 million earmark for soy bean farmers were true.

                The most disappointing thing about leaving the military is that it usually means leaving the last bastion of leadership in America. If you open your own business or freelance, you probably don’t notice the cowardly bastards populating corner offices in most American enterprises. You’d puke, as Holden Caulfield might say.

Turns out, of course, that the humans are right and science is wrong. The statue was a fraud.
When I first heard the story of the AF1 fly-over of New York City that created panic on Wall Street, I immediately, instinctively knew that it the publicity photo story was wrong.

                One single legislative act will stop government overspending in its tracks.
In 1978, Representative Jack Kemp (R-NY) proposed legislation (which had no chance of passage in Tip O&amp;rsquo;Neill&amp;rsquo;s Democrat Congress) designed to stop the government from defrauding investors with inflation: bond indexing. The measure would have the additional value of discouraging government spending.
Ronald Reagan and Milton Friedman endorsed Kemp&amp;rsquo;s proposal. Let&amp;rsquo;s dust off this bill and push it through Congress as a memorial to Jack Kemp.

                In the battle between conservatives and statists, a fundamental difference seems to lie in the meaning of a concept found in the Declaration of Independence:
 Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed[.]
 The dispute is how men convey consensual powers to their government.
Conservatives believe that governmental power is conveyed exclusively through the Constitution; statists believe power is conveyed through elections.

 House Democrats went on record again in favor of advancing the legislation while allowing only limited debate, which would hobble the ability of Republicans to wrest concessions on one of Obama&amp;rsquo;s top domestic priorities.

Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp wanted to index everything, especially Treasury notes and taxes. By &amp;ldquo;indexing,&amp;rdquo; we mean tying rates (interest and tax) to the inflation rate. Calls for indexing subsided after Reagan and Volcker did what Ford and Carter could not: whip inflation now.
With a $2 trillion deficit this year and multi-trillion deficits projected as far as the eye can see, inflation will return to ravage the American consumer.

Our government is moving quickly to obliterate all vestiges of the free market republic that America once was. With the Republican party in disarray and the Democrat party in the hands of statist despots, the tea partiers are the only thing standing between liberty and tyranny.

Before Obama destroys your kids’ minds in his “let’s kill all the productive people” Nazi-Marxist youth camps, make them read the seminal work on conservatism by Mark Levin.
Having authored a Conservative Manifesto myself, I am confident that this book is the definitive thought on conservatism.
If you’re new to politics and activism, you need this primer. It will arm you with the verbal and intellectual ammunition you need send the scrawny rabble rouser we call a president back to the slimy rock he crawled out from under.

I know this is a little late, but I was waiting for Congress to spend another trillion dollars or so before committing my prediction to the public. Here goes:
GDP and unemployment will flatten and even improve a bit in first half of 2009 for a couple of reasons:
First, people will begin to look for excuses to spend money. This includes businesses.
Second, the hideous transfer of power from individuals to government that passed Congress on Friday will have a psychological effect on people making some believe that things will get better soon.

Arctic Sea Ice Extend Growing
Not too long ago, Al Gore told German school kids that the North Pole, Santa, Polar Bears, and puppies would all be dead and rotting hunks of diseased fleshed in barren, desserts that were once the Arctic Sea by the time they entered high school. Turns out that the Arctic Sea Ice Extent for 2007-08 and 2008-09 is pretty much in the average for entire history of measured sea ice extent (1979 to present).

The UAW is the AARP in an Edsel: It has three times as many retirees and widows as “workers” (I use the term loosely). GM has 96,000 employees but provides health benefits to a million people.

 Al Qaeda is out of practice. The terror organization has been quite since 2001, pinned down inside in Iraq where our heroes destroyed their efforts to establish a beach head.
The coincidence of the horror in Mumbai with the FBI reports of a serious, legitimate threat to the NYC subway system seems coordinated to me.
Since 9-11, the US, UK, and Israel have trained and developed anti-terrorism techniques jointly with many nations, including India.

                At the current rate of decline in Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s definition of &amp;ldquo;the rich,&amp;quot; by June 2009, anyone earning more than $20,136 a year will get a tax increase.
Since July 2008, Obama&amp;rsquo;s definition of rich has been declining at rate of 20 percent per month. Simple extrapolation shows that even minimum wage earners will face a tax increase by the time any legislation can be enacted in June 2009.
In other words, Obama&amp;rsquo;s real definition of &amp;ldquo;rich&amp;rdquo; is: &amp;ldquo;you have a job.

                After showing signs of life following Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s top-shelf performance against Joe Biden on Friday, McCain reminded me of an addict who fell off the wagon. He&amp;rsquo;s addicted to boredom. It was like previous horrendous performances by Republican Senior Guardsmen: Bob Dole in 1996, George H. W. Bush in 1992. Did McCain look at his watch?
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, folks, but this guy does not want to be president. I have no doubt that he did.

Wow. Smart, smart man. Only . . . most colleges don&amp;rsquo;t have an IQ requirement. George W. Bush has degrees from Yale and Harvard, but his IQ is, like, 28 according to Biden. I guess whatever schools Biden went to, they give diplomas based on IQ instead of credit hours.

They were wrong. So was I.
Somehow, McCain staged a masterful comeback, and I use the word &amp;ldquo;masterful&amp;rdquo; advisedly. His comeback was not spectacular or flamboyant or even memorable. It was quiet, consistent, and strong.

One example of the phenomenon comes from the cult of Global Warming.
The brilliant Anthony Watts has uncovered some old newspapers from 1922 and 1933 that prove my point very well. From the Washington Post of November 2, 1922, we learn that the death of the Arctic ice cap was nigh:
 The Arctic ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot, according to a report to the Commerce Department yesterday from Consul Ifft, at Bergen, Norway.

The church, whose manifesto and pastor spoke indefensible words of separatism and hate, could have taken its lumps, reformed, and move on. Instead, under the direction of the Reverend Otis Moss II, it came out swinging.

The Power of the Black Pulpit
The preacher is a powerful, revered figured in black Christian communities (Jones, 1989). Good families teach their children to learn from and emulate the preacher&amp;rsquo;s words and actions. According to Kirk Byron Jones,
 The roots of black preachers&amp;rsquo; prerogative and power are in the soils of African religion and American racism.

 Sen. Barack Obama on Saturday decried &amp;ldquo;the forces of division&amp;rdquo; over race that he said are intruding into the Democratic presidential nomination contest.
 Remember that Jeremiah Wright is Barack&amp;rsquo;s spiritual advisor of 20 years. So,isn&amp;rsquo;t this a matter of the pot calling the kettle . . . African-American?

                Ace of Spades describes this breaking story as &amp;ldquo;nuclear&amp;rdquo; for the Obama campaign. I agree.
Obama&amp;rsquo;s only defense in the Rev. Jeremiah Wright scandal was to claim he never heard vitriol spew from Wright&amp;rsquo;s mouth. Many pundits, including Obama supporters, warned that any evidence putting Obama in that church during an ant-US, anti-white hate sermon would be Obama&amp;rsquo;s undoing. He&amp;rsquo;d be a proven petty liar.
Looks like he is:
  Wright laced into America&amp;rsquo;s establishment, blaming the &amp;ldquo;white arrogance&amp;rdquo; of America&amp;rsquo;s Caucasian majority for the woes of the world, especially the oppression suffered by blacks.

The normally eloquent and certain Obama was a stammering fool, carefully choosing his words, trying to remember what he&amp;rsquo;d said before and what&amp;rsquo;s been written by his campaign.

                Karl Roves cites three possible affects of the prolonged Democrat nomination process on John McCain&amp;rsquo;s chances:
  Clinton and Obama bloody each other, leaving the Democrats with a &amp;ldquo;damaged goods&amp;rdquo; candidate for the general election.
  The excitement of a brokered convention draws millions of sideliners into the political process, mostly on the Democrat side, giving whoever wins that party&amp;rsquo;s nomination a leg up.
  The protracted race pushes McCain off the front pages, allowing the Democrats to define McCain in any light they choose.

                The Catholic Church is often wrongly accused of suppressing science throughout the so-called Dark Ages. Legend has it that the Church used her secular influence over divine-right monarchs to thwart scientific inquiry.
It&amp;rsquo;s all hooey, of course. During the Medieval period, the lack of an economic system that generated surplus left the Church alone to advance science, translate texts, and preserve history.
But that&amp;rsquo;s a different story.
Al Gore and his band of merry thought police are doing to science what the left claims the church did&amp;ndash;slitting the throats of anyone who dares speak heresies against the Global Warming god.

Chavez is a Stalinist, and Stalin founded and expanded the Soviet Union with a combination of force, threats, and promises. Every Soviet student expects Chavez to follow suit.
 President Hugo Chavez on Sunday ordered 10 battalions of troops to the border with Colombia after Colombia&amp;rsquo;s military killed a top rebel leader.
He called the U.S.-allied government in Bogota &amp;ldquo;a terrorist state&amp;rdquo; and labeled President Alvaro Uribe &amp;ldquo;a criminal.

David Brooks&amp;rsquo; masterful obituary of William F. Buckley in the New York Times gives that paper a reprieve, however short, from the right&amp;rsquo;s vituperations.
 National Review&amp;rsquo;s readers no doubt shared a hatred for Communism, but many of them simply wanted to be like Buckley.
 Guilty as charged. And proud of my crime.

In a debate, Obama said he would deploy troops back into Iraq, after a pullout, if al Qaeda established bases. (Do I really need to point out the lack of intelligence, understanding, and strategy his comment portrays?)
McCain responded by saying, &amp;ldquo;I have news for Senator Obama, al Qaeda is in Iraq, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re fighting in Iraq.

The right (myself included) knew damn well what the left media were up to: influence voters to pick the weakest, viable Republican candidate.
They&amp;rsquo;ve done it.
McCain was the &amp;ldquo;media darling&amp;rdquo; candidate only until all other candidates fell out. That fall out came with this week&amp;rsquo;s primaries. Today, the very media that built up McCain and propelled him to the Republican nomination tore him down.

 Yesterday, key Clinton supporters accused Obama of &amp;ldquo;lifting&amp;rdquo; a passage of the rousing speech he delivered to a party gathering in Milwaukee on Saturday night from Massachusetts Gov. Deval L. Patrick, a longtime friend and supporter.

                The Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer in Latin intrigues me. I think it&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s so easily understood to speakers of English.
This is a prayer to memorize, even if you&amp;rsquo;re not a Latin Mass type. The rhythm of the language is soothing, and the words begin to take on a higher meaning.

                I am disheartened that James Joyner continues to find more fault with conservatives&amp;rsquo; reasons and methods for attacking a socialist than with the socialist himself.
In the growing debate over a Che Guevara Cuban flag proudly adorning the wall of Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s headquarters in Houston, Texas, Joyner comes galloping to Obama&amp;rsquo;s defense, ignoring the mounting evidence that Obama is as every bit as much a threat to capitalism as is Hugo Chavez.

                The New York Times on Tuesday will carry story describing the Hillary Clinton campaign as a death-watch (h/t Drudge).
It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that on January 7, I wrote the Kerry campaign obituary prematurely. Still, the problems Hillary faces are of the sort that spells doom to candidates, either in their nomination quest or, later, in the general election. Shuffling top staff, borrowing money from the candidate, asking staff to work without pay are all symptoms of a campaign in deep trouble.

Something close, in the strategic sense, happened recently in Iraq. US fighters seized the diary of an al Qaeda in Iraq leader. The journal provides our side with names of terrorists, descriptions of their tactics, evidence of their atrocities, and catalogs of their weapons.
Just as important, though, the book proves that we are winning and the terrorists are losing.

Bill&amp;rsquo;s eight years in the White Houseleft a void where most presidents leave a legacy. He&amp;rsquo;s best known as the president who turned the evening news rating from TV13 to TV-MA.
In recent weeks, he&amp;rsquo;s angered Democrats and liberals by claiming, in so many words, that only black people are stupid enough to vote for Obama.

Clinton, once considered the inevitable nominee, appears weak and wounded headed into the February 5 Super Tuesday primaries.

                With his third place finish in South Carolina, a lot of us are just waiting for the announcement from Fred Thompson that the race, for him, is over.
Charles Bird blogs on RedState that Thompson should do the honorable thing by dropping out and endorsing McCain. McCain, in turn, would return the favor naming Thompson his running mate if nominated.
 Thompson has enough support from social and economic conservatives to bring us a solid base going forward, especially if Thompson is a presumptive running mate.

                I love many things about WordPress, but their upgrades suck.
About 2 weeks ago, WP notified users that an urgent security fix was required. I put it off as long as I could, but last night seemed like a good time to try it.
I have 2&amp;ndash;count &amp;lsquo;em 2&amp;ndash;test sites. I upgraded both of them with no problem. then I repeated the process exactly on my live site and permalinks broke.

                The polls in South Carolina closed 52 minutes ago, and ABC News projects that John McCain and Mike Huckebee will finish first and second (or second and first) with Fred Thompson battling Mitt Romney for third.
A third place finish could spell the end for Thompson and hopes for a conservative Republican candidate in 2008. A win for McCain could put the Arizona Senator and former POW on a wave that would carry him to the nomination&amp;ndash;and a brutal defeat in November.

I have to admit, I paid absolutely no attention to recent polls in Nevada. South Carolina is where the action is, where my attention has been, and where my head and heart lie. South Carolina is where Fred Thompson, the conservative candidate for President, makes his stand.

This week, we learn that some Canadians continue their persecution of conservatives, Christians, and free-speakers.
Right Wing News has the story of a blogger called before an Islamic council to answer for his crimes&amp;ndash;printing excerpts of a Mark Steyn book.

                The most recent three polls from South Carolina demonstrate one thing clearly: you can&amp;rsquo;t believe polls.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the latest from RealClearPolitics. The spreads and the leaders are so out of whack, so changing, that no one can draw any intelligent conclusions.
While McCain&amp;rsquo;s number is static at about 26, Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s numbers fluctuate wildly. Romney and Paul are steadily falling, while our hero Thompson rises steadily.
Let&amp;rsquo;s hope more Huckabee supporters break for Fred in the next 24 hours.

 Nasty fucks. I&amp;rsquo;ll bet George Soros finances this act of terrorism, too.
 The raid on the school was the second in a week. On Wednesday armed men fired anti-tank rockets at it, causing serious damage to the building.

                Al Qaeda in Canada, officially known as the Alberta Human Rights Commission, is persecuting Ezra Levant, former publisher of a magazine called The Western Standard, now defunct. His crime, according to the Commission, was publishing the famous Mohammed cartoons that originally appeared in a Danish Magazine.
Levant was ordered against his will to appear before the Commission on Friday, January 10. He began with a compelleing opening statement that made the Commission sound like a collection of Nazi boobs hellbent on destroying the right of political speech and to advance the cause of radical Islam in Canada.

                Mitt Romney is pulling his broadcast advertising from South Carolina and Florida (h/t Drudge).
This could help Fred&amp;rsquo;s Fort Sumter strategy. I might have been wrong about Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s descent, as he seems to remain above 20 percent in key states. By conceding South Carolina, though, Romney may end up driving soft supporters to Thompson, and that might be his strategy.
With McCain, the media darling, rising, Romney could hope to bump up Thompson&amp;rsquo;s numbers in the Palmetto State.

Lyndon Johnson&amp;rsquo;s Great Society programs, built on Roosevelt&amp;rsquo;s economically untenable New Deal welfare state, had set the nation&amp;rsquo;s economy and social classes on a path to destruction a decade earlier. The self-absorption of the Baby Boomers decayed the social institutions and mores that sustained us for 200 years.

                Many of you don&amp;rsquo;t remember 1984. I was a junior in college, campaigning for Reagan, on campus and off. For those of you who weren&amp;rsquo;t around then, I can tell that even gray, rainy days were brighter than than sunniest June sky had been in 1979.
Nothing expresses the change in America better than this classic. Brought to you by the Republicans.

                After tonight&amp;rsquo;s 90 minutes with the Republicans, I can say without any fear of error whatsoever that Fred Dalton Thompson is the most qualified person in either party to run the United States of America. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:
 * Thompson understands the philosophical foundations on which this country was born and became the greatest nation on earth * Thompson&#39;s sense of humor is sharp, ready, and appropriate * Thompson&#39;s legal training and experience shines when it comes to framing the issue, such as &amp;quot;why not Barack Obama?

                Robert Novak (h/t Wizbang! Jim Addison) reveals today that Mitt Romney&amp;rsquo;s campaign released the phony story that Fred Thompson would withdraw and send his support to McCain. That may explain why it appeared Thompson and McCain singled out Romney for attacks in Saturday Night&amp;rsquo;s debate on ABC.
Addision is a bit skeptical of Novak&amp;rsquo;s conclusions, noting that Bob did not name a source. I suspected Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s campaign as the source, but Romney is also a possibility.

                Last night I had to log off as soon asthe GOP debate ended, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d log my impressions this morning.
The Good
Thompson, McCain, and Giuliani helped themselves in varying degrees. Captain Ed Morrissey seems to agree:
 Fred Thompson got Romney to admit he liked the &amp;ldquo;mandates that you want&amp;rdquo;. It seemed to me that Thompson and McCain won the foreign policy portion of the debate. Everyone got a chance to score a few points off of Ron Paul, who trotted out the same tired &amp;ldquo;terrorism is our fault&amp;rdquo; theme that he just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to surrender.

Ron Paul looks like Jack Riley, the comedian who played Mr. Carlin on the Bob Newhart Show in the 1970s:

That, and Fred Thompson won hands down. Rudy and McCain (in that order) Placed and Showed.

                Former governor Mitt Romney has won the Wyoming Caucuses. Romney has 6 of the 12 delegates up for grabs. Two other delegates are split between Thompson and Duncan Hunter. With 4 delegates to be decided, that leaves Romney with a lock.
Nonetheless, if Thompson could pick up 3 of the remaining 4, it would be a banner day for the true conservative voice.
The Wyoming GOP has an Excel spreadsheet showing the candidate favored in each county.

                Fred Thompson, who only a week ago was predicted to finish behind Ron Paul, roared into third place in the Iowa Caucuses, passing McCain and Giuliani. Huckabee and Romney finished one and two.
Because so many had written off Thompson, his third-place showing should bolster his campaign&amp;ndash;a campaign that seemed stuck in low gear until recently.
The sad news is the support for Huckabee, a &amp;ldquo;non-conservative&amp;rdquo; Baptist minister who played a populism card in Iowa, demagoguing the Christian Right to build big momentum headed into the caucuses.

                Just as Fred Thompson&amp;rsquo;s campaign started to take off, a loose conspiracy of MSM and bloggers seems determined to bring him down.
As I blogged last night, a single rumor on Control Congress, which seemed implausible, turned into a major story today&amp;ndash;the day of the Iowa Cauci.
Apparently, the anti-Thompson forces were spooked by his surge in the polls in Iowa and decided to employ one of the dirtiest tricks in politics: the withdrawal rumor.

                Control Congress carried a rumor, today, that appears to have no legs.
 I was watching the Morning Joe and they claim the rumor is out that if Thompson does badly in Iowa he may pull out and endorse McCain.
 Whether or not McCain or Thompson might, at campaign&amp;rsquo;s end, recommend their supporters to one or the other remains a possibility. But I seriously doubt this rumor came from inside Thompson&amp;rsquo;s campaign.

                There are reasons to believe that Fred Thompson&amp;rsquo;s campaign is surging in Iowa.
First, Zogby&amp;lsquo;s daily tracking poll finds Thompson in a tie for 3rd with McCain.
Second, a Des Moines Register poll concluded 12/30 saw Thompson&amp;rsquo;s numbers rise by 2 percentage points.
Third, strategic Vision, concluded 12/30, shows an up-tic for Thompson.
Fourth, pundits are taking notice of both the late surge and Thompson&amp;rsquo;s penchant for substance over glitz:

                Liberalism is cultural treason.
Past US wars have spawned heroes. Generations honored them. I came of age in the 1980s, but I was well aware of men like Audey Murphy, Ted Knight, Doolittle, Patton, the men of Iwo Jima, the Baton Death March. These great men shaped our understanding of what it means to be a man.
Liberalism, though, has robbed my sons of such heroes. At least, it&amp;rsquo;s made their task of learning about these heroes much more difficult.

                Lawyers don&amp;rsquo;t like to ask questions of a witness unless they know the answer the witness will give and can compel the witness to give it.
Hillary Clinton, whose troubles with questions from the people are the stuff of political legend, is employing the reverse of this lawyer&amp;rsquo;s rule: don&amp;rsquo;t take questions if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a good answer.
As Riehl World View explains that Hillary&amp;rsquo;s take NO questions in an attempt to avoid further gaffes, like not knowing how many children her close, personal friend Benazir Bhutto had.

                I planned to get new brakes on my car and to rearrange the storage room in the basement with my week off between Christmas and New Year&amp;rsquo;s. Solitary tasks.
Yesterday, though, like many of you, I read about theBlog Burst for Fred Thompson. I linked to Captain&amp;rsquo;s Quarter&amp;rsquo;s (where I first read the story), then to Rick Moran and John Hawkins, who seem to have launched the effort. For the rest of the day, I found myself e-mailing friends and posting updates about the effort to raise enough money for Fred to run a commercial in Iowa lead up to the caucuses.

The blog burst has put Fred back on the air in Iowa. From our friend, Sean Hackbarth, at Fred &amp;lsquo;08:
  Your efforts are working. “Substance” is now airing in Iowa. We’re only $87,398 away from making sure it stays running through the caucuses. If 2200 people give $40 we make our goal. That’s doable since our average contribution today has been over $70.This wide-open Republican race means anything can happen.

                Mark Steyn might have said it best
Benazir Bhutto&amp;rsquo;s return to Pakistan had a mad recklessness about it which give today&amp;rsquo;s events a horrible inevitability.
Were any of us surprised to hear the news today? An Islamofascist slug shot to death Benazir Bhutto then blew up, either of his own volition or remotely by his sponsors. (We&amp;rsquo;ve learned to not believe that all terrorism executors are volunteers.)
Pakistan is home to Usama bin Laden, al Qaeda&amp;rsquo;s central command, and the what remains of the Taliban.

YOU DID IT! THE BLOG BURST REACHED ITS GOAL
Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s too strong, but it&amp;rsquo;s true. Anyone who votes for a candidate because of his or her statements on current issues is a moron too intellectually lazy to consider the gravity of a vote for president. Moreover, &amp;ldquo;issues voters&amp;rdquo; are gullible and selfish egomaniacs too caught up in their own immediate wants to recognize a liar when he&amp;rsquo;s selling them snake oil.

                When Drudge devotes his middle column to the collapse of Congress under Democrat control, you know the Dems are in trouble.
Citing four hit pieces in major papers, including The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post (here and here), USA Today, and The Hill, the DrudgeReport does to Pelosi and Reid what no amount of Republican advertising could ever do; he proves that Democrats are unfit to run the government.

Conservatives, like Rush Limbaugh and Michelle Malkin, are doing back-bends to convince us that Iran is still a nuclear threat. Fine. I won&amp;rsquo;t argue that point. But a much larger story here looms, and everyone is missing it.
Iran&amp;rsquo;s reported abandonment of it nuclear weapons drive coincides with the United States&amp;rsquo; invasion of Iraq!

That candidate is Fred Thompson, who leads the GOP in publishing specific ideas. Perhaps the reason other candidates don&amp;rsquo;t put their ideas onto paper is that they don&amp;rsquo;t have any. Or they know that conservatives won&amp;rsquo;t like them.

                The next election loomed ominously upon the political horizon in November 1979. A decade of failed foreign policy, Soviet expansion, stagflation, gas and oil shortages, historically severe winters, soaring crime rates, marauding youth, sexual perversion, and unstable standards left the American people wondering, &amp;ldquo;What next?&amp;rdquo;
Next, of course, was the Iranian hostage crisis, which might well be called &amp;ldquo;the last straw.&amp;rdquo; Jimmy Carter and his Democrat party took the blame. The once proud term &amp;ldquo;liberalism&amp;rdquo; became profane.

 If I believed this poll be accurate, I really wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to be an American any longer.

                St. Louis&amp;ndash;A CNN/Time Magazine/Al-Jazeera poll of 1,098 ineligible voters finds that Illinois Democrat Barack Obama would be the next president of the United States were the election confined to non-voters. The ineligible groups polled included the mentally ill, children, and convicted felons. Among high school students, Obama trounced second-place candidate Hillary Clinton 62 percent to 14 percent. The mentally ill, including schizophrenics and victims of head trauma, gave Barack a slight advantage over Democrat Dennis Kucinich 34 to 32 with Joe Biden of Maryland finishing a close third.

The hours that we work are a bit off-putting, though.
 The U.S. employee put in an average 1,804 hours of work in 2006, the report said. That compared with 1,407.

Last week, as good new about the surge was cresting, the AP treated as fact an opinion piece that the &amp;ldquo;body count&amp;rdquo; in Iraq had doubled since the surge began.
Today, AP customers are leading with another AP opinion piece claiming that August was one of the bloodiest months since the Iraq war began.

 How have things changed in Iraq? Petraeus compared the previous condition of Ramadi to Stalingrad. The general told the newspaper that having to stay on defense had taken its toll on American strength and had emboldened the enemy.

Environmentalist Bette Midler (who, I think, is related to Barbara Streisand) faces state charges in Hawaii for illegally killing more than 200 trees on her estate.  The staff of the Board of Land and Natural Resources recommended $6,500 in fines for having the trees felled and for building a graded road without permits required for the land zoned for conservation use.
 Of course, she had the trees clear-cut in order to improve the environment, or so her publicist claims.

In a FoxNews.com article, James Hansen explains that the storm cannot be blamed on climate change, but it can be attributed to human activity.
Cities, it seems, make storms worse. Tall buildings direct wind upward, intensifying the storms. City heat islands, like warm ocean water to a hurricane, fuel storms.

                The Charleston terrorist story that began last Saturday has not been resolved, but the networks, dailies, and news magazines are keeping it hush-hush. Why? Are they cooperating with the feds in a larger investigation? Or did the DNC or one of the Democrat campaigns ask the media to bury the story? Or do the MSM no longer consider terrorism in the United States newsworthy?
Captain Ed asks some of the same, disturbing questions, and links to other who ask them, as well.

Tonight I decided to try Apple&amp;rsquo;s Safari for Windows. It&amp;rsquo;s a beta version, but it&amp;rsquo;s about the 3rd beta.
I have to admit, it&amp;rsquo;s impressive.
The Clear Text is a little easier to read than IE7 and miles more readable than FireFox. Performance is excellent. The look, though, is fantastic. Nothing on the screeen that you don&amp;rsquo;t need&amp;ndash;unless you want it.

                UPDATE: 6:42 p.m. CDT: MSNBC.com now reporting that the two Muslim men arrested near the Charleston Naval Weapons Station were in possession of pipe bombs. Their attorney assures us that a) they have a really good reason for possessing pipe bombs, and b) the two Middle Eastern men with pipe bombs near a Navy base are victims of racial profiling. Whatever. Profile away.
   Before details about the pipe bombs were released, the executive director of a civil rights organization for Muslims in Tampa criticized the arrest as racial profiling, an accusation South Carolina police denied.

                For years, global warming alarmists have claimed that aerosols have masked the effects of greenhouse gases in the past, explaining why global temperatures cooled during a period of rapid greenhouse gas production in the 20th century.
But a new study by University of California-San Diego and NASA (found on FoxNews.com) indicates that the alarmists were wrong about the aerosols: they don&amp;rsquo;t reduce temperature but raise it. In other words, the things that wackos claim to reduce global warming actually cause global warming.

 The Berkeley County Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s Office believes that among materials in the car&amp;rsquo;s trunk were a bomb and bomb making materials that include chemicals, fuses, and igniters. The men 21-year-old Yousef Megahed and 24-year-old Ahmed Mohamed were pulled over Saturday evening during a routine traffic stop near Myers Road and Highway 176.

                Last night in the U.S. House of Representatives, a party&amp;rsquo;s leadership refused to abide by a legal vote (Volunteer Opinion Journal).
The vote was on a Republican measure to strip from a farm bill language that guaranteed welfare for illegal aliens. The vote was 215-213 in favor of stripping the guarantees.
But Nancy Pelosi wanted a different result. So, her minions essentially burned the ballots, declared there was no vote, and ordered a new one (Michelle Malkin).

                Matt Margolis at GOP Bloggers questions the cutting-edginess of the YouTube debate. He&amp;rsquo;s right in his various points about the ordinariness of the whole affair.
To make the presidential race more interesting, I propose a blog-off. The candidates have to start a blog using a commonly available blog app: WordPress (my fave), MoveableType, etc. The candidate with the highest TLB Ecosystem score wins his party&amp;rsquo;s nomination.
The rules
 1. Posts must be submitted by the candidate himself or herself.

                Michelle Malkin responds to that unnecessary race of humans known as liberals. The liberals, it seems, have gone about calling her web site, michellemalkin.com, a &amp;ldquo;hate-site.&amp;rdquo;
Other bloggers are jumping in to defend Michelle. I won&amp;rsquo;t. I think she has one of the best blogs in the business, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t need my defense.
First, liberals are evil little creatures&amp;ndash;more little than evil, in the small, petty sense. Their self-righteous slander is not really meant to hurt its target as to aggrandize the speaker or writer in his own small mind and among his own petty peers.

 &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a consensus developing around him that&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear and pretty profound,&amp;rdquo; said John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, an Orlando-based conservative group. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anything like it in 25 years in politics.&amp;rdquo;
 I agree. In 1979, as a high school sophomore with a National Review subscription, I became dissatisfied (for a short time) with the GOP.

The speculation is based on discoveries of Fred Thompson&amp;rsquo;s signature and name on court briefs in various Washington, DC. One of the briefs&amp;ndash;a &amp;ldquo;friend of the court&amp;rdquo; brief&amp;ndash; from August 1981 argues that citizens cannot be arrested for activities that are not against the law.

Matt Margolis, who does great research, has the answer.

 Just not enough global warming. The Gores&amp;rsquo;ll have to kick out a lot more CO2 in 2008. See Matt&amp;rsquo;s piece for the whole story.

As an act of courtesy to the politics-weary American public, Fred Thompson is likely to announce his candidacy for the GOP nomination for President in September, according to columnist-reporterRobert Novak.
Thompson&amp;rsquo;s late entry may reverse a trend in recent years in which the next presidential campaign begins before the last one ends. If Thompson believes the people will be sick of Giuliani, Clinton, and Obama by the time the Super Bowl comes around, he may be right.

But the new al-Qaeda video featuring a haggard Osama bin Laden has folks speculating about his health and even his life.
Gateway Pundit compares the most recent video (in which bin Laden appears for less than a minute) with a video from 2002. The background and bin Laden&amp;rsquo;s attire are identical. And doesn&amp;rsquo;t look so hot.
If this is not a new taping, then it could be an attempt by al-Qaeda to hide the terrorist&amp;rsquo;s death.

Okay, here&amp;rsquo;s why Thompson will probably be the next POTUS. Personality.
We like to think we vote for intellectual reason, but we don&amp;rsquo;t. Ask any sales professional how people buy, and the answer will be, &amp;ldquo;people buy on emotion and justify on reason.&amp;rdquo; Voting is the same.
Heard of buyer&amp;rsquo;s remorse? It happens when the (emotional) rush of buying fades and you&amp;rsquo;re left with only your intellect to defend the purchase.

                The Democrat Party released its official agendum for the 2008 party convention today. Mark Noonan, journalist extraordinaire, obtained an advance copy.
From the opening flag-burning to the end-of-evening driving arrangements, the party of defeat has thought of everything.
Mark has formatted the schedule for convenient printing and laminating. Be sure to share it with your friends.
Don&amp;rsquo;t miss the first comment from a whinny liberal idiot, either.

                Maybe it was the times.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s—even after 9/11—the people I worked with were friends. We socialized after work, attended each other’s weddings, and held heart-felt happy hours for our friends who left the company, voluntarily or not, to pursue “other opportunities,” as the official e-mail usually read.
Those were happy times. The telecommunications sector of technology where I worked at the time was shedding jobs like a German Shepherd drops hair in Spring.

                Recently, I’ve had the task of explaining to clients why it’s more difficult and error-prone to change their web applications’ configuration metadata than to change code. They don’t take my story well. After all, the whole idea of many web applications is configurability. By that I mean that a non-programmer can change, add, or remove values that cause either business rules, workflows, navigation flows, or content of a web site to change.

We all learned in grade school that the &amp;ldquo;original&amp;rdquo; Americans were those who came across the Bering Straights about 3,000 years ago. They migrated from present day Alaska to Canada, the US, Central and South America. Then the white man came from Europe, spread disease and pestilence, herded them into corrals known as reservations, raped the women and cattle, killed all the bison, cut down the pristine forests, and placed onerous taxes on all that was left standing.

Let&amp;rsquo;s hope Ted Kennedy&amp;rsquo;s theological insights make to the Vatican before the Pope writes his homily for Midnight Mass. We&amp;rsquo;d hate to mis-catechize the Christian world by talking about Jesus when Christmas is really about hourly wages, health insurance, and campaign contributions from unions.

He chose, at an early age, to kill for money, to sell drugs, to destroy families (including his own), and to make life for others as miserable as he&amp;rsquo;d made his own. He founded a street gang and supervised its stretch from Los Angeles to almost every major city in the US. With the help of a fawning press and Hollywood, murdering for kicks in the Tookie Williams style became as glamorous as murdering for politics did with the Black Panthers.

                Anti-Religion Religion professor, Paul Mirecki, has retained a lawyer to investigate the possibility of suing the University of Kansas for denying him rights under the First Amendment. A Law Professor reviews the possiblities for Mirecki and KU. Paul M. Secunda, an associate professor of law at University of Mississippi says Mirecki might have a difficult time building a case against KU.
 From a public employment standpoint, Mirecki would not seem to have a procedural due process claim against Kansas, as public employees are not seen as having a property interest in administrative positions such as the chairmanship of the department as opposed to having such interests in their professorial positions.

Meanwhile, Douglas County Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s office has seized Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s car and computer as part of its investigation into Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s alleged beating. Says Mirecki, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m being treated more like a criminal than a victim.

                The Topeka Capital-Journal  (free registration required) online has a piece that exposes Professor Paul Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s anti-religion intolerance. While I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to say his &amp;ldquo;beating&amp;rdquo; was a hoax, after reading more about the case since getting home from work, one could make the case that Mirecki used some injury as an opportunity to strike back at those he perceived to be attacking him: Christians and the media.
Consider the depth of Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s intolerance and the leading university response to Mirecki:

                Michelle Malkin has done great digging and found more holes in Prof. Paul Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s (see this and this) beating story than in Howard Dean&amp;rsquo;s brain.
For instance, Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s description of injuries do not match the hospitals. The police report gives very little evidence. Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s claim, that he got out of his truck to confront two yahoos who were crowding him makes little sense UNLESS Mirecki is the kind of guy who likes to settle things with his fists (which would greatly increase my respect for the guy).

                Okay, I can&amp;rsquo;t claim credit for this research. Jack Cashill earns the kudos for his December 1 commentary on WorldNetDaily. As with pro-terrorist professor Ward Churchill, Mirecki has a long paper trail of opposing those with faith, particularly Catholics and Jews. Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt from Cashill&amp;rsquo;s outstanding piece.
  In response to a SOMA communicant outraged that students were distributing free Bibles on campus, Mirecki told of how he had conceived an &amp;ldquo;anti-Bible tract&amp;rdquo; to counter the Christian presence.

According to Fox News, a University of Kansas professor who created a class designed to attack Christianity and Intelligent Design theories was beaten by a couple of thugs yesterday.
 Last week, Mirecki asked the university to cancel the class after he created a furor by sending an e-mail to a student organization mocking Christian fundamentalists.
 Mirecki had referred to religious conservatives as &amp;ldquo;fundies,&amp;rdquo; and said a course describing intelligent design as mythology would be a &amp;ldquo;nice slap in their big fat face.

When others demands seem overwhelming and pointless, when deadlines seem arbitrary, when commitments seem only burdens with no reward, I have to remind myself of the obvious simplicity of Toms motto.

(If the road to hell be paved with good intentions, then hell&amp;rsquo;s bowels gurgle and belch with the dyspeptic cosmic waste of those who disbelieved in eternal punishment.)
And while those calling themselves &amp;ldquo;conservatives&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;of the right&amp;rdquo; resort to base name-calling and mudslinging, it is far worse, far more self-damning, when a liberal does it.

                The correlation between liberalism and selfishness is too easy to make. Atheistic liberalism gives selfishness a whole new dimension. But liberals, who in their selfishness consider themselves the epitome of compassion, say you can&amp;rsquo;t measure compassion.
I utterly refute that idiot sentiment. And it is nothing more than mere sentiment.
Via FoxNews.com, we learn that folks in liberal states spend their money almost exclusively on themselves, while &amp;ldquo;Bible belt&amp;rdquo; people spend money on those who need help.

                Anne Rice, the occult writer who left Catholicism for vampirism (literarily) at the age of 18, has returned to the Mother Church.
In an interview with Newsweek (on MSNBC.com), Rice says that her reconversion will be the sole focus of her future writing.
 In two weeks, Anne Rice, the chronicler of vampires, witches andunder the pseudonym A. N. Roquelaureof soft-core S&amp;amp;M encounters, will publish &amp;ldquo;Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt,&amp;rdquo; a novel about the 7-year-old Jesus, narrated by Christ himself.

In the 4th General Congregation of the 11th General Synod of Catholic Bishops, today, the centrality of the Eucharist, the purpose of the Synod, was central to the discussion:
  Archbishop Jan Pawel Lenga M.I.C., from Karaganda, Kazakhstan, who was persecuted for his faith during the years of soviet communism, recalled the days when the Eucharist was forced to be celebrated in secret by the faithful.

Before making landfall 6 hours earlier than currently projected, the hurricane will pick up speed to &amp;gt; 20 mph, weaken to &amp;lt; cat. 3 and make landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border as a mid-category 2.

                When I was a runner, I took part in many runs to support various charities. One I never joined was the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. Not because I oppose breast cancer research, but because something about that particular organization rubbed me the wrong way. For one thing, it seemed too big, too intrusive. It was like a charity version of the AFL-CIO, before it collapsed.

I just received this holy news from Karl Keating&amp;rsquo;s newsletter:
 Last Thursday Catholic World News transmitted this story, filed out of Dublin, regarding what might happen to what is commonly called the Tridentine Mass:
 &amp;ldquo;Pope Benedict XVI will take action soon to allow all Catholic priests to celebrate the Latin Mass, a Cambridge historian has predicted.
&amp;ldquo;Speaking to a conference of priests in Ireland earlier this week, Eamonn Duffy said that it was &amp;lsquo;extremely likely that Pope Benedict will lift the restrictions on the celebration of the Tridentine liturgy,&amp;rsquo; the Irish Independent reported.

                TheNew York Times Online, today, is drumming up sympathy for abortion.
 Venetia Grunder, 21, viewed an ultrasound image of the fetus in her womb. She was 12 weeks pregnant, though she had taken birth control pills as directed. &amp;ldquo;I feel pretty messed up,&amp;rdquo; she said after seeing the image. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s different, just knowing. My husband told me not to look. This changes my feelings, but I&amp;rsquo;m sticking by it. Damn it, $650, I&amp;rsquo;m sticking by it.

                Once upon a time, men and women separated themselves from society in order to pray. Often, their piety attracted like-minded individuals to join them. Among early Christians, the practice became fairly common, and continued through the middle ages and even after the Reformation. While that may not be an official definition of monasticism, it fits.
One can only imagine that forming a new religious order was easier in the days of the great kings of Europe than it would be today.

                The people at Planned Parenthood are the kinds of cowards who give cowardice a bad name.
Dawn Eden demonstrated, today, how Planned Parenthood tried to divert money for Katrina Relief into their own abortion mills. Now, if you&amp;rsquo;re eugenicist, racist, baby-killer like those who run and support and profit from Planned Parenthood, then the their logic will make sense:
 a) Most of the really, really brutalized victims of Katrina we saw on television were poor blacks; b) if there weren&amp;rsquo;t so darn many poor blacks, the hurricane&amp;rsquo;s effect would have been far less catastrophic; therefore, c) if we prevent poor blacks from breeding, we will avoid future Katrinas.

                A week ago yesterday, anticipating Katrinas arrival on the Gulf Coast, I penned the following paragraph on this blog:
 Perhaps we fortunate souls in the rest of the country should begin a ring of volunteers willing to put up a displaced person or family until they can get back on their feet. Im sure the government will help relocate folks. While St. Louis isnt exactly Louisiannas backyard, our door is open to such a family in need.

                With perhaps 10,000 dead in the Gulf Coast, it seems almost silly to talk about one man&amp;rsquo;s death. But the man who died first came to our attention with bushy sideburns, thick glasses, and wide lapels.
William Rehnquist was never a politician. He was just a judge. His devotion to the Constitution was amazing. He never deviated from his path of original understanding and legislsative intent. When Rehnquist authored an opinion, it was right in the eyes of the law, in the eyes of democracy, and in the eyes of God.

Scarborough says he&amp;rsquo;s been involved in many hurricane relief efforts, and he&amp;rsquo;s never seen one this unresponsive.
In New Orleans, there are very few Guardsmen, police, doctors visible. Several doctors left the Super Dome, unable to treat people because of the violence. One doctor reported the problem of the bodies of murder victims: four Wednesday night, four Tuesday, maybe more.

                The Department of Homeland Security just faced its first major test in New Orleans. It failed miserably.
No one is in charge. Looters, gangs, thugs, and murders rule the streets. (See Michelle Malkin: Can Law and Order Be Restored?) Police and other supposed officials have no instructions on what to do with refugees, who are herded from one street gang war to another. Days-old-babies are boiling in the sun while police yell at their helpless mothers to keep moving toward the danger zones.

                There are at least 35,000 refugees fleeing New Orleans. Shep Smith on FoxNews just helped save a five-day-old baby. The infant and her mother had been dropped off of a boat after being rescued from an attic with 12 other people. The baby was burning hot, and Smith had to flag down a police officer to get medical attention. Dramatically, the police and paramedics showed up while Smith was interviewing the people on the air.

I have been running Firefox on both Linux (SuSE&amp;rsquo;s latest) and Windows (XP Pro SP2) since beta days. With each release and each patch, I expect the uncountable list of problems to abate. Instead, the list grows only longer.
On Windows, Firefox has plenty of plug-ins, though not enough. It freezes constantly.

                In the continuing story of the resurgence of Roman Catholicism, Newsweek online reports on an orthodox Catholic frat at Franciscan University: Knights of the Holy Queen.
Many on the Catholic right have long argued the church&amp;rsquo;s decline began with Pope Paul&amp;rsquo;s misguided reform of the Holy Mass in 1968. During the 1970s, Catholic dioceses and parishes in the Western world purged their sanctuaries of Christ, the Crucifix, the Blessed Mother, God, prayer, reverence, and holiness, replacing these &amp;ldquo;relics&amp;rdquo; with worship of the profane, the creature, the created.

When a woman feels that her man can no longer protect her or their children, she has no use for him. Humor, cooking, intellect, whatever other qualities he might have become meaningless. They were only perquisites stacked atop his primary attraction: safety.

                The only liberator of women in history was Jesus Christ. Catholics are accused, falsely, of worshiping His mother, Mary. We venerate Mary. We ask His mother to pray for us, to intercede with Him on our behalf. We try to imitate her faith and obedience&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;Be it done unto me according to thy word.&amp;rdquo; And most of us usually fall way, way short.

                The Roman Catholic Episcopate is set to introduce sweeping changes to the Latin Rite liturgy during its General Synod, October 2 through October 23, 2005.
According to the agendum for the synod, which Catholics should read here, the following points will be addressed:
* Intensive catechesis on the importance of keeping the Holy Days of Obligation, particularly the Sunday requirement. * Dignity, due preparation, and faith in the mystery of the Eucharist * The secularization of salvation and religious relativism * Understanding that &amp;quot;participation&amp;quot; in the Mass centers on receiving the Body and Blood of Christ the Redeemer, not standing in the sanctuary with your hands in the air in imitation of a priest.

 Over the past fortnight Israeli intelligence agents have noticed something distinctly odd happening on the internet. One by one, Al-Qaedas affiliated websites have vanished until only a handful remain, write Uzi Mahnaimi and Alex Pell.

 BALLYMENA, NORTHERN IRELAND, Ireland, July 27 (CNA) - Tuesday saw what police have called a wave of intimidation attacks against Catholics in and around Ballymena, a mostly Protestant town northwest of Belfast.
 The Associated Press reported that Protestant extremists planted a homemade grenade outside a Catholic family&amp;rsquo;s home in Ballymena. The bomb detonated, causing minor damage. Arsonists badly damaged one Catholic-run pub in the village of Martinstown, and caused minor fire damage to the outside of another pub in nearby Rasharkin with two gasoline-filled bottles.

Michelle Malkin has done a great job on this story, finding the loopholes in Franken&amp;rsquo;s loopholes.
Those of us who always assume the worst motives of limosine liberals are alway right.

                I wish I could give the details, but that would cause problems. Suffice it to say that two weeks ago, something my wife and I had been praying hard for seemed to have been placed out of reach. If that was God&amp;rsquo;s answer to our prayers, it was a resounding &amp;ldquo;Get lost.&amp;rdquo;
Thankfully, though, we didn&amp;rsquo;t stop. I went straight to the perpetual adoration chapel and knelt before the exposed Body of Christ for an hour and a half.

I&amp;rsquo;m sure all those who have complained about the music weren&amp;rsquo;t inspired by my blog. More likely, they were inspired by the same Holy Ghost that inspired me.

                Since the beginning of the labor union movement, the greatest threat it felt&amp;ndash;often paranoically&amp;ndash;was management (or the Republicans) &amp;ldquo;breaking&amp;rdquo; the union. The external threat was seen to come from anti-union laws, movement of jobs overseas, and negotiating tactics that left union strikes powerless. Now, it seems, that the union movement may, like communism, collapse from its own weight.
After a steady 20&#43; year decline in union membership, the flagship of organized labor, the AFL-CIO, fractured this week, losing more than 1/3 of its membership.

                My weekly attack on Catholic liturgical abuse needs some caveats:
* I accept the teaching of the Second Vatican Council as bound in heaven as on earth. * I accept the validity of the New Mass based on the church&#39;s Magisterium and the indefectability of the church. * I do not believe that people who attend (by choice) New Mass are living outside the faith.

 Catholics are to continue to oppose it, and to ensure that all provincial and territorial regulations on the solemnization of marriages provide full protection for freedom of conscience and religion, as guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
 Meanwhile, in Spain, a judge, Laura Alabau, has refused to marry a lesbian couple and is appealing to that country&amp;rsquo;s high court to overturn the law.

                Now that Canada has made homosexual &amp;ldquo;marriage&amp;rdquo; the law of the land, it won&amp;rsquo;t be long before Catholic priests are imprisoned for refusing to preside over such blasphemy. Though Canadian Liberals assure us that the law applies specifically to &amp;ldquo;civil&amp;rdquo; marriages, there is no protection against civil suits against priests who refuse to conduct homosexual marriage ceremonies. And we all know how much liberals enjoy suing.
The good news is that the situation may provide an opportunity for Canadian martyrs, of which there are few.

                Is there a more depraved place in the West than Holland? Their pediatricians condone the murder of newborns. (Thanks to Mark Noonan.)
I remember back in the early days of the Roe v. Wade wars when pro-lifers would use the term &amp;ldquo;slippery slope&amp;rdquo; and liberals would laugh their rears off at our moronic fear that euthenasia and assisted suicide and the whole plethora of eugenics would soon follow.
Well, liberals: we were right.

                Providentially, I was listening to Ros Moss on EWTN radio this morning. A man from Boston called in. He was in his late 30s with a family. He was almost in tears over the state of the church.
Specifically, he has fought a losing battle against a pair of Extraordinary Eucharistic Ministers who distribute Holy Communion in his parish. The pair is a &amp;ldquo;married&amp;rdquo; gay male couple. They are openly gay, they carry on public displays of affection in during Mass.

                A View From the Pew has a fantastic take-down of Fr. McBrien&amp;rsquo;s attack on &amp;ldquo;conservative&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; Catholics. This is a fine read in preparation for the Pope&amp;rsquo;s upcoming documents on the needs of the church.
I hope Pope Benedict&amp;rsquo;s roadmap will drive the likes of Fr. Richard McBrien to some church where he belongs. His snotty attack on conservatives deserves scorn from all corners of the Catholic church.
McBrien considers liberal Catholics mentally healthy, well-adjusted, and intelligent.

                St. Rita&amp;rsquo;s parents picked a husband for her when she as 15. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good choice, though. He beat her, gambled away their money, and carried on open affairs with other women. They had two children. Rita had wanted to enter the convent until her parents told her to marry this man. Her sons, despite Rita&amp;rsquo;s Christian teachings, followed the ways of their father.
Rita&amp;rsquo;s husband was mortally stabbed. He converted on his death bed, as did her two wayward sons who died shortly thereafter.

By endorsing euthenasia for the elderly, the AARP has admitted that it serves no worthwhile purpose and must be put to sleep.
Certainly, just disbanding would be the moral thing to do. But if the AARP insists on disbanding by suicide, who am I to get their way?

 Messianic Jews, like Christians, believe that Jesus (or as they refer to him, Y&amp;rsquo;Shua) was the expected Messiah. Though they claim to be following the true Judaism, mainstream Jews are nearly unanimous in rejecting the idea that Messianic Jews are Jewish, and many believe them to be Christians intentionally targeting Jews for conversion.

                Atlanta, GA&amp;ndash;TheUnited Church of Christ has endorsed homosexual marriage and demanded that God rewrite the Bible &amp;ldquo;to reflect modern realities.&amp;rdquo;
According to UCC Rules Committee member, Nancy Ballabeuster, &amp;ldquo;God could not have foreseen such changes in human relationships as we&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed in the past 30 years. We know that God is love, and as such She would want us to have a Bible that makes everyone feel good about herself, regardless of sexual orientation, race, or criminal activity.

                Your Excellency:
Thank you for giving us the Tridentine Mass at the beautiful St. Francis de Sales church.
I grew up, mostly, in the Novus Ordo Missae. Over the past 30 years, I have seen the Mass go from a reverent, prayerful worship of God, to a social gathering, to, now, something that seems more like a baseball game. I use Perpetual Adoration, the daily Rosary, and novenas to pray, because prayer during Mass has become almost impossible.

                You walk up a flight of granite stairs to a pair great wooden doors beneath a spire rising, it seems, miles toward the heavens. The heavy door opens slowly, because of its weight, but surprisingly easily, like a perfectly balance vault door.
The vestibule is dark and reverent, not grand at all. It might be the foyer of an old, downtown office building except for the small stained-glass windows. Then to the inner doors, smaller, but heavy and wooden.

                I tried to read &amp;ldquo;Crossing the Threshold of Hope.&amp;rdquo; I failed. Because of that, I was skeptical about the writings of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI.
The first Ratzinger book I read was &amp;ldquo;Many Religions, One Covenant.&amp;rdquo; I read it in 2 hours. Had the world ended during those two hours, I&amp;rsquo;d have missed it.

Sadly, there was really a Roman Catholic Cardinal, Jaime L. Cardinal Sin, who passed away.
He must have been very holy man. Imagine the Holy spirit&amp;rsquo;s work at convincing a Pope to promote someone named Sin to Cardinal.

                I could be accused of beating up on Anglicans. I am sorry if I am. The Church of England, though, claims to be an episcopal church. It believes in Apostolic succession. Until very recently, the Church of England was more closely united with the Roman Catholic church than any mainstream Protestant church.
It is because of the Anglican church&amp;rsquo;s proximity to Rome that I desire its internal reformation.

Is it possible that the most dangerous thing on earth is the believer who doesn&amp;rsquo;t trust God?
Someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in God is capable of doing great harm to himself, his family, and his community.

                Thanks toRomanCatholicBlog, I found this essay on abused liturgy by one of my heroes, Fr. James Schall, author of &amp;ldquo;Another Sort of Learning.&amp;rdquo;
Father&amp;rsquo;s Day, we attended Mass with my in-laws, including my wife&amp;rsquo;s grandfather, in Illinois. Instead of a homily, the priest decided to (ab)use that portion of the Holy Sacrifice to conduct a survey. Ushers passed out forms like baseball All-Star ballots. Those of us who were not members of the parish were left to sit and pray amongst ourselves while the parishioners applied their number 2 pencils to the little dots.

My wife is a lot smarter than I am, much better educated, and much dedicated to the things she finds important.

Reading his letter to the parish, I felt the hair on the back of my neck rise to attention. Some months ago, I nearly joined the very church Rev. Kimel is leaving. Thank you, God, for sparing me that humiliation, though I fully deserve the humiliation I would have felt.

                The Friday before John Paul II died, EWTN aired a documentary about Polish saints. For me, the most fascinating was St. Maria Faustina Kowalska, canonized by Pope John Paul II in 2000.
Her diary, at 700 pages, is the most powerful testimony of faith I have ever read. Those who do not understand the joy of suffering for God must read this work of pure faith. Before I picked up the text last month, I was familiar with the phrase &amp;ldquo;offer it up.

                While reading the links from the Nunsense story on RomanCatholicBlog, I found this. I have only skimmed it so far, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good story, well written, timely, and encouraging.
Conversion stories are among the most importat to reinforcing faith. All of the Epistles, really, were testimony to conversions of Jews, pagans, Greeks, Romans, and others. We learn so much about our faith from those who came to faith as adults or who returned after being adrift in secular confusion.

                My grandma used to say three Hail Marys whenever she lost something of value. That little act of faith has brought about many little miracles, including once when the lost object fell onto a dining room table seemingly out of thin air.
Last Friday, my wife was almost inconsolable over the loss of her pinky ring given her by her grandmother twenty years ago. She&amp;rsquo;d worn the tiny ring every day of her life.

                Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska adored silence. Only through her special relationship with Jesus Christ could she find the inner strength to pray, to contemplate, worship, and hear God, amid the din of her convent. I can only imagine the cacophony of that house of nuns.
With Mothers Day commitments abound, I was reduced to attending 5:30 Mass tonight. I lasted 10 minutes18 if you count the time before the Mass started.

Chesterton was not a prophet, but a genius. As such, his observations of history serve as predictions of the future. Pope John Paul II became pope when detente was still in the air, when Jimmy Carter was urging the world to accept the perpetualism of Soviet communism, when Americans were told that our best days were behind us.

 Thank you. Your words are comforting, though I don&amp;rsquo;t have much fear of God, except the kind of fear one naturally has toward something of incomprehensible greatness.

                In Illinois, quickly becoming the most leftist state in the union, Planned Parenthood and other infanticide supporters, are pushing a bill through the state&amp;rsquo;s legislature that will make it more difficult for pregnant women to obtain ultrasounds, according to the _Illinois Leader _via Jack Lewis.
Why?
Because seeing a picture of an unborn child tends to turn women against whimsical murder&amp;ndash;the chief form of amusement for Planned Parenthood.

                Most people who dabble in politics and political writing can point to one defining moment, one event, one story that crystallized some nebulous thoughts into a clear, palatable drive to do something. If you were born in 1963, the youngest of four, and you watched the excesses of the 1960s rip your older sisters from your parents, you share a lot with me.
On November 4, 1979, I lay in the bathtub warming sore, cold muscles after a rare Sunday high school football game.

                Politics used to end at the water&amp;rsquo;s edge. Now it ends at the treatment room.
Peter Jennings announced today that he has lung cancer&amp;ndash;the deadliest cancer of them all.
Many who read this blog detest Jennings&amp;rsquo;s politics, as do I. But Peter Jennings&amp;rsquo;s life hasn&amp;rsquo;t been all roses. When Don Imus made fun of his marital situation a few years ago, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t laugh. Perhaps Imus had never loved. Or perhaps he&amp;rsquo;d been spared the pain of a love that blinded him to the treachery of the object of his affection.

Then the Pope died.

                The Vatican just announced that the Pope suffered heart failure earlier this evening. Dr. Arthur St. Andre says that he may . . . may . . . be surviving only on his IV to keep his blood pressure up. The Vatican describes the pontiff as seriously ill but lucid and comfortable. There are reports that doctors recommended he return to the hospital, but he personally declined. Obviously, he wants to die at what has been his home for the past quarter century.

 Nine out of ten of what we call new ideas are simply old mistakes. The Catholic Church has for one of her chief duties that of preventing people from making those old mistakes; from making them over and over again forever, as people always do if they are left to themselves.

 A state judge on Saturday rejected another attempt by Terri Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s parents to reconnect her feeding tube, rejecting what the couple&amp;rsquo;s lawyer described as their last chance to keep their severely brain-damaged daughter alive.
 The Schindlers said they will not appeal again.

                The Miami-Herald reports that Florida Governor Jeb Bush sent a team of state workers to take custody of Terri Schievo last week, nearly resulting in a confrontation between those workers and police.
 Hours after a judge ordered that Terri Schiavo was not to be removed from her hospice, a team of state agents were en route to seize her and have her feeding tube reinserted &amp;ndash; but they stopped short when local police told them they would enforce the judge&amp;rsquo;s order, The Herald has learned.

 A Bronx teacher who repeatedly flunked his state certification exam paid a formerly homeless man with a developmental disorder $2 to take the test for him, authorities said yesterday.
 But it gets better. What made authorities suspicious was that the homeless guy scored so much higher than the teacher ever scored they knew something was amiss.

                FoxNews just played audio of the David Gibbs&amp;rsquo;s phone call to Judge Greer in which Gibbs read the affidavit of the woman who soliticited a plea for life from Terri Schiavo on the day her feeding tube was removed.
The affidavit is stunning. There were numerous witnesses who heard Terri say &amp;ldquo;Aaah&amp;rdquo; and then yell &amp;ldquo;Waahn.&amp;rdquo; Among the witnesses was a female police officer.
Why in the name of God are just hearing about this now?

That might sound callous, but staying within the law is now our last refuge. As Thomas More told Will Roper in Robert Bolt&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;A Man for All Seasons&amp;quot;:
 This country&amp;rsquo;s planted thick with laws from coast to coast &amp;ndash; man&amp;rsquo;s laws, not God&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash; and if you cut them down &amp;ndash; and you&amp;rsquo;re just the man to do it &amp;ndash; d&amp;rsquo;you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then?

Those who have fought valiently to save Ms. Schiavo must take pride in having fought a good fight. Whatever Michael Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s motives may have been, and whatever the motives of those who took his side, we are best to assume their intentions noble absent evidence to the contrary.

I figured Siegel an atheist. He&amp;rsquo;s not. He believes in God, but he&amp;rsquo;s angry at Him. Very angry.
I wonder if a lot of atheists are actually just believers angry that they&amp;rsquo;re not God.
In Luigi Pirandello&amp;rsquo;s Six Characters in Search of an Author, we learn the absurdity of anger at one&amp;rsquo;s creator.

   it is worth remembering that the excruciating slowness of the execution here, the incremental-ness of death, is designed by its champions to inure us to it. After the first hour, the second passes with far less fanfare, and the third less still. I&amp;rsquo;ve been following this closely, and I needed to remind myself today how many hours Terri Schiavo has actually been without sustenance by counting the days since Friday afternoon and multiplying by 24.

_An explosion devastated a business center on a commercial street in Lebanon&amp;rsquo;s (search) Christian heartland, a stronghold of the anti-Syrian opposition, early Wednesday, killing two people and wounding two others, police said. _

 The guy on the street is often wrong about general principles of his environment. In other words, when a non-expert pontificates about the weather, the human brain, or the government, he&amp;rsquo;s very likely to come off as Cliff Clavin.
Experts, on the other hand, are usually expert only about general nature of a specific study.

                In Minnesota, a wierd kid who (supposedly) got picked on a lot decided to avenge himself by killing lots of people, including his grandparents.
I think, not so much of the killer, but of the other kids, even the bullies. Yesterday, they had plans. Today, they have wings.
 Hegstrom described the shooter grinning and waving at a student his gun was pointed at, then swiveling to shoot someone else. &amp;ldquo;I looked him in the eye and ran in the room, and that&amp;rsquo;s when I hid,&amp;rdquo; she told The Pioneer.

                There&amp;rsquo;s not much to say. Judges have determined, in logical order, the following:
A. Michael Schiavo is Terri Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s husband; therefore, B. Michael Schiavo is Terri&amp;rsquo;s legal guardian; therefore, C. Michael Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s desires trump laws of the state and of morality.
Florida law does not permit the execution of a person in Terri Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s condition. The judges (like Glenn Reynolds and James Joyner and others) are too cowardly to come out and say, &amp;ldquo;Look, people, the mentally ill make us kind of sick.

                Many people, including many conservative bloggers, believe that justice has been served in Florida. Terri Schiavo should be starved to death as ordered by Judge Greer. (And, please, don&amp;rsquo;t insult my integrity or intelligence by claiming he ordered otherwise. His order prohibits anyone from giving the woman food, water, or any other nutrients. He ordered her starved to death, not denied artificial support.) Well, I think that most of the people who support her murder must be ignorant of what they wish for.

Why?

Unfortunately, the current version of .Text is not ready for prime time.

   So, now, we&amp;rsquo;re going to spend hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to subvert the legal process and the wishes of both Michael and Terri Schiavo in this matter?
 Yesterday, I pointed out that, as individuals, we need to look on the Terri Schiavo ordeal from God&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint. But that&amp;rsquo;s the individual issue. Beyond that, we have to contend with the political/judicial aspects of this case.

   There is a passionate, highly motivated and sincere group of voters and activists who care deeply about whether Terri Schiavo is allowed to live. Their reasoning, ultimately, is this: _Be on the side of life. They remind me of what Winston Churchill said once when he became home secretary in charge of England&amp;rsquo;s prisons.

 Some people hate peace. Tonight, some of them detonated a car bomb in Beirut. Likely, the goal is to divide Christians from Muslims.

                Today before the United States House of Representatives, former major league baseball player and one-time single season home run champion Mark McGwire disgraced himself, his profession, and his career.
Under friendly questioning from William Clay Jr., (D-MO), McGwire repeatedly refused to say if he&amp;rsquo;d ever taken even andro, which he more or less bragged about using when he was a Cardinal.
Clearly, McGwire was a heavy steroid user. I didn&amp;rsquo;t believe so just two weeks ago, but he looked as guilty as OJ today.

                MSNBC - Reid threatens partial Senate shutdown
   &amp;ldquo;If Republicans want to go down this road, they are going to be beginning a huge, partisan, cataclysmic event, the implications of which are so profound that none of us really know the answer to it,&amp;rdquo; said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., one of the Democrats arrayed behind Reid on the Capitol steps. &amp;ldquo;It would mean the government could not function, which, more importantly, means we could not be doing the people&amp;rsquo;s work.

   The man who fatally shot seven people during a quiet church service before turning the gun on himself was on the verge of losing his job and upset over a sermon he heard two weeks ago, investigators said Sunday.
 Let me get this straight: this guys having a tough time personally, then a sermon ticks him off. He gets his gun, goes to church, and kills a bunch of people, then himself.

What of it? Suppose the CIA is abducting terrorists like Abu Omar and secreting them off to Kuwait or Egypt or Saudi Arabia? So what? Would Italy prefer to harbor these monsters indefinitely?
This is a war against the kinds people who consider mere torture sport. If the abduction and aggressive interrogation of one sicko Muslim radical reveals enough information to thwart a future attack, the practice justifies itself.

Crichton is actually an environmentalist and liberal, but once one strays off of the liberal plantation, he is no-good runner with rabbit in his blood who must be destroyed.
Dismissing Nicholas Kristof&amp;rsquo;s NYT Op-Ed column on the subject, though, may prove troublesome for tree huggers. Kristof&amp;rsquo;s environmentalist credentials are even more solid than Crichton&amp;rsquo;s, and his life includes the kind of humanitarian missions leftists talk about but rarely perform.

Blind Mind&amp;rsquo;s Eye: A challenge to social conservatives who are upset by the Supreme Court ruling on executing minors
   As a more moderate libertarian, I have no particular problem with the death penalty, but do find in many ways the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s ruling to be consistent with how many want to view teenagers in this society.
 Mike makes some interesting assumptions about social conservatives&amp;rsquo; views of teens.

Yahoo! News - DNA Evidence Found in Judge Killings Case
   _A DNA match from a cigarette butt convinced police that a Chicago electrician was the killer of a federal judge&amp;rsquo;s husband and mother, authorities said. _
 For a week, the leftist press typed its stories with crossed fingers that some white supremist hate group murdered the judges family. Instead, it was a run of the mill, disgruntled plaintiff.

                Back in the early 90s (and isn&amp;rsquo;t that frightening?) I was doing something like blogging in Groton, Connecticut, for Town Hall on CompuServe&amp;ndash;pre-Web days. One of the topics of the day was Generation X. People like Rush Limbaugh and others got a kick out of making fun of Xers. They were slackers who wanted to make $45.00 an hour flipping burgers. Or, better, they wanted to graduate from college and step into an eighty grand a year job with a company car.

Captain Ed sums up McCain&amp;rsquo;s chicanery quite well:
   Here we have a man who has done more harm to the First Amendment as anyone in the past generation, all the while scolding us on coordination of electoral efforts, and he&amp;rsquo;s playing a shell game with Cablevision in order to gin up indirect payments to his staff.

In the best acting, the more &amp;ldquo;make believe&amp;rdquo; the presentation, the more real. A great play demands that you strip the stage of technology and present truth in angry, cold, black and white, two-dimensional reality. Truth shines through, unencumbered by sets and lights.

                The union workers I grew up around weren&amp;rsquo;t liberals by any stretch. They were Archie Bunker (and I mean that in a good way). Since the early 1980s, though, their unions have abandoned putting workers first in favor of putting leftwing ideology first. The result has been a massive exodus from the union shops into non-union companies.
But the unions have also done a disservice to the entire middle class. By concentrating on politics instead of labor issues, the AFL-CIO and other big unions have favored policies that destroy middle class jobs.

UPDATE: Looks like I was way, way off base with this explanation. According to theHouston Chronicle, the Texas legislator sponsoring the bill is Republican Phil King. King&amp;rsquo;s says that when municipalities provide free internet access they screw up the free market.
   King&amp;rsquo;s basic objection, Trainor said, stands  in a free-market system it&amp;rsquo;s not acceptable to let public government compete with private businesses

                Well, we know that the left opposes the death penalty for the likes of Dennis Rader, the BTK killer, but some do support capital punishment for political speech and activity. Stephen Crockett wants murder Katherine Harris and Ken Blackwell because they&amp;rsquo;re Republicans. Combine this with the DUer who wants to beat the crap out of the 9-year-old for Social Security reform, and you have the makings of a leftwing lynch mob.

                The disturbing case of Ward Churchill has me asking a question I ought not ask, but somehow feel compelled. The NCAA has an arcane, complicated, often brainless set of rules regarding recruitment and pampering of college athletes. The rules require major universities to hire folks just to deal with compliance. I hate bureaucracies like that.
But the system effectively reduces the ability of a college to buy great sports teams. Moreover, the system demands that members require minimum (though way too minimal) education standards for student athletes.

Heres a sample of what the losers are saying:
        1. exploiting children&amp;hellip;yup, that&amp;rsquo;s family values, alright&amp;hellip;.

A brave, good neighbor of his called him out two days after another neighbor died. She was a good woman dying of cancer with a little dog. She would let the dog out to go potty, and Dennis Rader, Animal Control Officer, would give her a citation.

Basically, Corn says what we already know: Howard Dean is his own worst enemy, and, as DNC chairman, is turning into his party&amp;rsquo;s worst enemy. Specifially, Corn responds to Dean&amp;rsquo;s recent announcement that people are afraid to call themselves Democrats because &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not socially acceptable to be a Democrat.

                The Chris Rock quote that got so many conservatives so up in arms about abortion appears to be more pro-life than pro-choice, according to John Swansburg writing on Slate.
The controversy involves this line from Rock: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s beautiful that abortion is legal&amp;rdquo; and says that he likes to pick up women at abortion rallies. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Cause you know they&amp;rsquo;re [expletive].&amp;rdquo;
But that isolated sentiment is part of a larger theme in Rock&amp;rsquo;s routine, and, in reasonable context, constitutes a slap at the frivolity of &amp;ldquo;choice.

                The more I read of the utterances and writings Ward Churchill, the closer I come to the conclusion that Churchill has never been right about anything in his life. The Guiness Book people may need to launch a new category.

                Kudos to Instapundit for this link.        Churchill did address the issue of his ethnicity, admitting that he is not Native American.     &amp;quot;Is he an Indian? Do we really care?&amp;rdquo; he said, quoting those he called his &amp;ldquo;white Republican&amp;rdquo; critics.     &amp;quot;Let&amp;rsquo;s cut to the chase; I am not,&amp;rdquo; he said.     His pedigree is &amp;ldquo;not important,&amp;rdquo; Churchill said: &amp;ldquo;The issue is the substance of what is said.

Relish the way lefty Rall views people with regular jobs. The sneer, the smugness, the inuendo. How DARE a plebian attempt to think!

While I&amp;rsquo;m not quite ready to jump on the Condi 08 bandwagon just yet, this is a very encouraging story for those who have.

                Michelle Malkin reports that the United Nations has hired a Kerry hack to run a new blog aimed at salvaging what&amp;rsquo;s left a reputation that currently ranks somewhere between Dan Rather and Ward Churchill.
Hiring Kerry hacks demonstrates the UN&amp;rsquo;s tone-deafness to American politics. I&amp;rsquo;m still waiting for some ex-official to open the books on the Kofi Annan and his family money laundry.
UPDATE: Remarkably, the UN Blog allows neither comments nor trackbacks.

   The Rocky Mountain News today claims that Mr. Ward Churchill received tenure as a result of Colorado University&amp;rsquo;s failure to explore an alleged offer of tenure from the University of California system.
  I am interested in knowing whether or not Mr. Churchill implied such offer was made, or if someone at Colorado merely assumed such.

                Last week, Steven Taylor brought up the fact of Ward Churchill&amp;rsquo;s very thin credentials for his chair and tenure at University of Colorado. Taylor also noted that UofC waived some normal requirements in the process, namely demanding a PhD. Now we know that the left&amp;rsquo;s favorite nut case obtained both tenure and chair of Ethnic Studies at University of Colorado by lying. He convinced UofC that the University of California system had offered him professorship in American Indian studies, causing Colorado to rush his tenure through.

Usually, these stories garner only a &amp;ldquo;whatever&amp;rdquo; from me. Not sure why this one has me thinking about my kids and parents and wife. It does. Avian flu outbreaks in Vietnam bird populations threaten to spread across the world. This could be the worst pandemic since 1918. Worse than that even, since 72% of those diagnosed with this nasty virus &amp;ndash; die.
 The H5N1 avian flu, which first appeared in Hong Kong in 1997 and has since popped up twice, is evolving and can jump directly from birds to people, killing an estimated 72 percent of diagnosed victims, Gerberding said.

                Dean&amp;rsquo;s World  noticed that a Howard Dean support threw a shoe at Richard Perle when Perle began speaking at debate against Howard in Oregon yesterday.
Joe Gandelman, guest blogger, asks several questions about the mental state of the person who threw the shoe. But this is typical Deaniac behavior. Its why Dr. Dean wanted no press at the affair. His side has nothing to say, save for we have more shoes than we need, so you take some.

                The New York Times print edition has a delightful story about the new friendship between George Bush 41 and Bill Clinton.
Some of was pretty harsh on Clinton during his presidency, and Im certainly in that group. But a friendship between the presidents father and predecessor is good for everyone.
George H. W. Bush, a terrible politician and so-so leader, is a wonderful human being. Bill Clinton is a man of no real political convictions, endless charm, and endearing wit.

 The current Social Security system is a very poor investment. A 25-year-old man is predicted to receive a 0.82 percent rate of return on his Social Security taxes.2 Low-income workers have extremely poor rates of return, and many low-income men will receive less in benefits than they paid in Social Security payroll taxes.

                The hamburger giant, McDonald&amp;rsquo;s, sued two lefty idiot activists in England for libel after the pair distributed pamphlets accusing McDonalds of starving the Third World, deforestation, and killing people with poisonous food. McDonald&amp;rsquo;s won the libel suit.
But wait . . . liberals don&amp;rsquo;t lose in courts in Europe. So the wackjobs&amp;ndash;Helen Steel and David Morris&amp;ndash;appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in, where else, France. That court ruled against Britain for failing to provide the couple with massive, expensive legal assistance.

                John Kerry tried to make a campaign issue out of the flu vaccine shortage. It didn&amp;rsquo;t work, but he tried. So did other senior Democrats.
Today we learn that flu shots may not prolong lives among the elderly.
   Led by National Institutes of Health researchers, the study challenges standard government dogma and is bound to confuse senior citizens. During last fall&amp;rsquo;s flu vaccine shortage, thousands of older Americans, heeding the government&amp;rsquo;s public health message, stood in long lines to get their shots.

                I would love to do a study on the lifetime achievement of Rockwood School District.
The district covers far west St. Louis County, Missouri, and touts itself as one of the best school districts in the nation. Based on standardized scores, they have every right.
But Rockwood has some problems, too, and some of those problems have or will become societal problems.
Rockwood, it seems, prefers dealing with the highly intelligent, well-behaved children of very rich Wildwood folks.

                Over at Left2Right, Don Herzog claims that conservatives worship at the alter of &amp;ldquo;strict construction&amp;rdquo; of Constitutional matters.
   Strict construction means applying the language of the Constitution to what it straightforwardly refers to, not  here&amp;rsquo;s the connection  using it as a springboard to make stuff up.
 You&amp;rsquo;re wrong from the get-go, Don. Conservatives don&amp;rsquo;t honor strict constructionalism. We insist on original understanding.
Put simply, the framers of laws have one chance to get their meaning across in writing.

                About two months ago, right around Christmas, a silly little girl who attends some college somewhere in Pennsylvania sent me a nasty, mean e-mail. She had read something I wrote about the United Nations. Her college indoctrinators had convinced her that the only to achieve anything close to justice in the world is to dissolve all governments save for the the UN.
Well, little girl who was too shy to pen her name, if you sawABC&amp;rsquo;s 20/20 tonight, you learned a little about that wonderful institution.

His writing is as enjoyable as his conversation&amp;ndash;and it&amp;rsquo;s conversation he has on talk shows, not interviews.

                UPDATE: Join the discussion on the official Ward Churchill Discussion Board.
UPDATE: Vote in the Ward Churchill Poll
Joe Gandelman, blogging on Dean&amp;rsquo;s World, has an observation about the recalcitrant and intellectually bereft Ward Churchill.
   All kinds of books came out post-911 that clearly laid out the fact that terrorists seek high body counts. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the bodies are you, your wife, your newborn kid, your grandmother, Jews, Christians, atheists or Muslims who are unlucky enough to be in the target area.

                Two years ago this coming Tuesday, I met a girl for a drink at the Fox and Hounds at Cheshire Inn in St. Louis. She&amp;rsquo;d contacted me through Match.com about two weeks earlier. I watched her cross Clayton Road. She moved like a dream&amp;ndash;beautiful, graceful, certain. We talked for over 3 hours. I sang all the way home&amp;ndash;40 minutes. I sang Sinatra and Lenny Kravitz.
We went out on Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, one week later.

                UPDATE: Steven Taylor favors us with an extensive examination of the Churchill debate with links to pertinent blogs and articles. I understand his points about the protections Churchill has built up over time: tenure, government employee, etc. As an originalist, I don&amp;rsquo;t buy the government employee protection because I don&amp;rsquo;t buy the conduit of the 14th Amendment argument. Further, firing him is not the same as incarcerating him. The state of Colorado is under no Constitutional or moral obligation to continue the employment of any person it deems detrimental to the state&amp;rsquo;s welfare.

                Before I ever heard the term blogging, I published three 500-750 word columns a week on my old website. That started in 1999. Work and other things became too demanding, so I let it lapse in 2001. This blog began about two years ago, but I got serious on December 15, 2003. I&amp;rsquo;ll mark that as my anniversary. It was the Monday after Saddam fell (crawled) into US custody.

                According to roving Hollywood reporter, Mike Evans, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&amp;rsquo;s popularity is now at 68%, six points higher than Ronald Reagan&amp;rsquo;s all-time high.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t think he&amp;rsquo;d run, then I didn&amp;rsquo;t think he&amp;rsquo;d win, then I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how well he&amp;rsquo;d do. But I have to admit, this guy seems to have been born to run the state of California. He&amp;rsquo;s been on top of the polls for over a year now&amp;ndash;probably the most popular governor of any state in the country over that period.

                Besides instantly becoming the most despised college professor in America&amp;ndash;not an easy thing to achieve, by the way&amp;ndash;Ward Churchill recieved two doses of bad news today:
First, though he claims 1/16 Cherokee, the tribe he claims to belong to says &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rsquo;s not one of us.&amp;rdquo; His name is nowhere in their database, so he&amp;rsquo;s not a member.
Next, the University of Colorado might fire him.

Let&amp;rsquo;s keep this brainless, hate-spreading, son-of-a-bitch around awhile. I like kicking stupid bastards around, and Ward Churchill is my top candidate for Stupid Bastard of the 21st Century.

While many Republicans cant wait for Dr. Dean to take his seat at the head of the opposition table, I am a little cautious.

                Senator Mark Dayton, a Democrat from Minnesota, called Condoleezza Rice and President George Bush liars on the Senate floor today.
While Senators have used the word liar occasionally, those occasions have been rare. At one time, the word demanded censure or a duel. These days, coming from members of Bill Clinton&amp;rsquo;s party, one must assume &amp;ldquo;liar&amp;rdquo; is some sort of underhanded praise.
Condoleezza Rice&amp;rsquo;s confirmation is already in the books. She will receive more than 2/3 of the Senate&amp;rsquo;s endorsement.

                The hosting provider I have used since May of last year was unabled to provide even minimal levels of service over the past month. As a result, the owner of that company decided to end its hosting business. Coincidentally, I saw his notice of termination while I was e-mailing him to let him know that I&amp;rsquo;d given up on his company&amp;rsquo;s ability to provide web hosting service.
Last night and tonight, I moved four large applications from the old provider to the new one, WebHost4Life.

You want to present three dropdownlists&amp;ndash;one for each set of data. When I select a Customer from list A, list is rebuilt with Orders for that customer, the first order is selected, and list C is updated with the Products for that order, the first Product selected.
Using ASP.NET postbacks is pretty straightforward, but it&amp;rsquo;s also pretty ugly. Al Alberto got us most of the way to a solution with this article on CodeProject.

Irrelevant.
That word comes up again and again, but in Crichtons text and in the readers mind. While reading State of Fear, I found myself using that term, boldly, even rudely, in numerous conversations and arguments. So much of what the left says is irrelevant.

                Time Magazine&amp;rsquo;s Man of the Year title often makes a mockery of the honor. Remember the PC?
This year, though, Time&amp;rsquo;s editors got it right. Tempted, no doubt, to embarrass their political enemy, the editors took the high road by selecting George W. Bush, the most remarkable President in half a century, as its Man of the Year, 2004.
   For sticking to his guns (literally and figuratively), for reshaping the rules of politics to fit his ten-gallon-hat leadership style and for persuading a majority of voters that he deserved to be in the White House for another four years, George W.

                Last week, I came across the news story about 12 homes under construction set ablaze in Maryland and used it to discuss eco-terrorism. Yesterday, authorities arrested a man named Aaron Speed. He is not known as an eco-terrorist, and apparently had no motive. Speeds works as a security guard protecting the home allegedly torched.
Something seems wrong here. While Speed has a history of mental illness, he reminds me of the guy they arrested in Atlanta for detonating a bomb during the Olympics.

I heard Walter Williams talking last year about these devices increasing the number of accidents and the number fatal accidents at intersections where they&amp;rsquo;re installed.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the reason:

I agree with much of what Ron writes, but why are Democrats so godawful afraid to say &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re Americans?&amp;rdquo;
Bilancia catches most of the keys to the 1980 team&amp;rsquo;s success: brilliant coach, team play, focus, creativity, hard work, working for something outside yourself, and staying on the offensive.

Never having been a proponent of the deterrent of the death penalty, I have maintained that capital punishment can be defended on two grounds:

Few leftist utterings irritate me more than the environmental nonsense that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard since about 1990. It all started with my knowledge of freon, particularly R-12 and R-114. I spent 10 years in the submarine force. Freon is a very dangerous gas on submarines because of its weight and its tendancy to turn into phosgene gas upon heating.

                Thanks to Joe Gandelman writing on Dean&amp;rsquo;s World, I just read George Will&amp;rsquo;s attempt at restoring sanity to liberalism and its party, the DNC. In this analysis, Will blames the stockpiling losses on liberalsm&amp;rsquo;s condescension, disrespect, and distrust of most Americans.
Will uses as an example a quote from Robert Kuttner writing in the leftist American Prospect:
        &amp;ldquo;Bill Clinton won election by declaring, as a matter of values, that people who work hard and play by the rules should not be poor.

Fashion: Plain is out; vibrant is in.
Autos: Uncertainty. The SUV craze is waning, but nothing seems to fill the void. In my opinion, hybrids, especially big ones, may become de rigeur.
Publishing: Fewer reads, more material will lead publishers to jump on some craze, like the spiritualism of the 90s or journaling/letters of last year.

                This is from a peace rally somewhere. Does this Nancyboy Junior Lefty really look he needs someone to tell him not to bully weaker kids? And do his teachers ask him whether Saddam bullied people? Perhaps he should learn about the brides Saddam&amp;rsquo;s sons routinely raped on their wedding nights. Perhaps he should learn about the mass graves in Kurdish north. Perhaps he should be lifting weights instead of holding idiotic signs that make him look like a pansy.

Let me repeat: The President of the United States rescued one of his body guards from a fight with other body guards.
George W. Bush is the coolest president since Teddy Roosevelt. These are the moments that define men at the pinnacle.
The president is supposed to walk away, seek the safety of other leaders and security agents.

                Dean claims that it&amp;rsquo;s unnatural for conservatives and libertarians to accept the idea of corporations. I think he&amp;rsquo;s wrong. While he may have moral argument, it is of no practical value.
My point: there may be rational moral arguments against corporations, but they are as pointless as moral arguments against thinking bad thoughts. Without the security of a stock or bond and the protection of arms-length ownership, few intelligent people would invest in individuals who have what might be a good idea.

                Not since college in the early 1980s have I spent as much time reading what liberals have to write as I have since the election. Much of what I&amp;rsquo;ve read demanded an immediate response. Some, though, stewed in my mind until it has, just now, reached a consistency worth serving to my readers.
I know that the liberals didn&amp;rsquo;t really care for Kerry. He isn&amp;rsquo;t their hero or idol. They don&amp;rsquo;t respect him, really.

                Jimmy Carter will probably attend Yassir Arafat&amp;rsquo;s funeral service in Cairo, Egypt. How typical of the man who considers the American Revolution a low point in world history.
Yassir Arafat was a tyrant, a murderer, a thief, a shameless self-promoter, a liar, a welcher whose ego killed more Palestinians than all of Israel&amp;rsquo;s weapons. While the UN and its amen chorus denounced Israel&amp;rsquo;s terrorism fence and the poverty Israel supposedly forced upon the Palestinians, Arafat moved hundreds of million of dollars to France&amp;ndash;money that might have alleviated Palestinian suffering.

But Newsweek&amp;rsquo;s coverage of Ashcroft is over the top. Their lead story, Ashcroft&amp;rsquo;s legacy, is an interview with a single person, David Cole, who has a toolshedfull of axes to grind with the outgoing Attorney General.
While liberals always have and always will hate Ashcroft, make up stories about him, accuse him of everything from fascism to the Johnstown Flood, this treatment is beyond the pale.

Goldberg makes a point that I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to make since Phil Collins was just Genesis&amp;rsquo;s drummer:
   What Maher, Raines, and Smiley fail to grasp is that all morality is based upon transcendence &amp;ndash; or it is merely based on utilitarianism of one kind or another, and therefore it is not morality so much as, at best, an enlightened expediency or will-to-power.

                George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s achievement in the election of 2004 ranks as one of the greatest political achievements of a century.
Elected without a popular vote mandate in a contested election that was unsettled for six weeks, Bush began his first term at a sharp disadvantage. Liberals hated him, lambasting him as a buffoon, an idiot, a redneck moron from West Texas who was too stupid to tie shoes, much less run a country.

My favorite posts, summarized:
 Everyone who voted for Bush is a toothless, SUV-driving, NASCAR-watching, illiterate who doesn&amp;rsquo;t deserve to vote America will become a 3rd world country Calling for boycotts of all American products by both Americans and everyone else in the world Begging Canada to annex the blue states. (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d stand in the way) Virtually hugs to liberals in red states who have to live amongst brain-dead idiots Hopes that radical Islamists will kill all American soldiers in the Middle East  Folks, these are the sentiments of the people we just defeated.

This was shameful. Again and again in this election, the MSM have used their power to influence the vote. Again and again, they were thwarted by the will of the people. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s have the will of the people dismantle the MSM.

                The networks and newspapers are not calling states they know Bush has won in order to not force Kerry to concede. As Jay Cost points out, this is disgraceful.
I will call it. Bush has now won Nevada, New Mexico, Iowa, and Ohio. He has won the popular vote. George W. Bush has been re-elected to a second term as President of the United States by the will of its free citizens.

Beginning with WSJ&amp;rsquo;s 216-203 Bush, I see the Toss Ups falling like this:
Bush 216 &#43; 63 = 279 (winner)
Kerry 203 &#43; 52 = 255 (loser)
Popular vote: Bush 50-Kerry 48-Nader/others &amp;lt;1.
Senate: GOP &#43; 4
House: GOP &#43; 4
Likely alternatiaves (in order of probability):
 Bush wins Florida Kerry wins Ohio Bush wins Pennsylvannia Kerry wins Minnesota Kerry wins Wisconsin Bush wins Michigan Kerry wins New Mexico Bush wins Hawaii

What could be more demonstrative of the Democrat intellectualism than these stories. They send sub-human union neanderthals to smash up Republican campaign offices because they&amp;rsquo;re afraid of losing on merit. Then again, isn&amp;rsquo;t the purpose of unionism to eliminate merit-based rewards?

Coupled with Howard Fineman&amp;rsquo;s assessment that the press has moral reasons to bury news that might help Bush, the conspiracy of the MSM against the president is more or less conceded by the conspirators themselves. Does anyone care?

Instapundit&amp;rsquo;s concensus reading is the Bush won by fighting to a draw. After the president&amp;rsquo;s miserable performance in debate one, this makes some sense.
Andrew Sullivan called it a draw.
Dean&amp;rsquo;s World reviewers took the president.
The Corner, though, is the interesting one. Based on the times of the posts, I&amp;rsquo;d say that Bush was miserable for first 40 minutes or so.

                If Kerry has his way, the price of an abortion will increase dramatically, because Kerry wants the government to pay for them.
For years I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained that the ridiculous cost of a college class is the fault of the government&amp;rsquo;s insane college assistance program. Providing funding for the difference between what a student can afford and what a college charges is a salesman&amp;rsquo;s dream come true.

Just the right inflection and sincerity, said, God Bless

                In this front page NYTimes.com story, the paper argues that Democrats are pummelling Republicans in registering new voters in swing states, specifically, Florida and Ohio. Looking at the headline, one might conclude that Kerry is gaining momentum. If you read more, then do a little independent work, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to reach a different conclusion.
Okay, so the Democrats are better at getting people to register. No doubt. In St. Louis, Missouri, the Democrat machine is canvassing cemetaries all weekend.

                While only 8% of Republics are ashamed of their jobs. What other conclusion can we draw from the fact that, according to OpenSecrets.org, 1 in 4 donors to John Kerry&amp;rsquo;s campaign refuses to disclose his employer or occupation while 92% of Bush contributors proudly disclose theirs.
Under federal law, candidates and parties are required to make reasonable efforts to determine the occupation and employer of all contributors. While Republicans are frequently fined by the FEC for failing to identify the occupuations of 5-10% of donors, Democrats generally skate by with 15% non-disclosure with no fines.

About the same time, some liberal mags were speculating that al Qaeda&amp;rsquo;s capacity to carry out spectacular acts of terrorism has been so greatly diminished that the Bush administration is being disingenuous by even mentioning the terrorism threat as a real risk.

There is something chilling in reading this article top to bottom, perhaps more so because 1972 is the beginning of my political awakening.
My parents were naturally Democrats, and I grew up in the very Democrat, blue-collar neighborhood of Southwest St. Louis where Scullin Steel once cast a sulfur cloud shadow over the old frame houses built in the declining days of the Jazz Age.

                Professional Bush-hater and admitted liar, Bill Burkett, has hastened the departures of Dan Rather and John Kerry from the national scene.
On Saturday, Burkett says he provided &amp;ldquo;information&amp;rdquo; on Bush&amp;rsquo;s National Guard record to the Kerry campaign via former Sentator Max Cleland.  While Burkett did not specify what that information was, it is clear that it included the forged memos that, eventually, found their way to CBS and Dan Rather.

The Gallup poll was conducted normally. The Pew people tried something new, by conducting the poll in two phases. Whether that accounts for the difference, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but somebody is wrong here.

                There is no other way to describe CBS News. They have proven to have no concern whatsoever about journalism integrity. They clearly want only to defame President Bush and to sway the election in Kerry&amp;rsquo;s favor. As such, CBS News is now a mere parody of itself, The Onion Network.
I was opposed to Congressional investigations of the network. They&amp;rsquo;ve changed my mind. Let&amp;rsquo;s have the Justice Department and FCC dig in as well.

Apparently, I&amp;rsquo;m not alone. Here&amp;rsquo;s an interesting quote from Powerline:

He claimed that doubters asserted that the CGTimes font &amp;ldquo;was not available&amp;rdquo; in the 1970s. No, Dan, no one&amp;rsquo;s claiming that. Typography experts are claiming, though, that the proportional font was not available on common typewriters in 1972.

                UPDATE: ArguingWithSignposts has some quotes from Democrat and CBS insiders indicating that both the Kerry campaign, which gave the memos to 60 Minutes, and CBS had doubts about their validity. Good analysis . . . take a read.
CBS News has launched an internal investigation into the validity of documents related to George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s National Guard service that it aired on 60 Minutes, according to Drudge. Other developments overnight seem to make it more likely than not that at least two of the documents were forgeries&amp;ndash;with Killian&amp;rsquo;s signature electronically placed on a memo fabricated by Democrat operatives, then fed to CBS News.

                The National Review Online has this excellent, anonymous piece by a self-described disgruntled Democrat who attempts to explain why Zell Miller is so angry. It&amp;rsquo;s great reading, because I remember my dad, a lifelong Democrat, becoming angry in 1972 and voting for Nixon. He went back (I think) the Democrats in 1976, but four years of Jimmy Carter has made him a permament Republican.
Bottom line is this: Democrats will sell out their country to win an election.

In West Virginia, Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America, gave Kerry a rifle as a gift. Kerry, a self-described gun-owner and hunter, quipped: **&amp;ldquo;I thank you for the gift, but I can&amp;rsquo;t take it to the debate with me.

                Turns out the President was a pretty good pilot, particularly in the classroom. This is from MSNBC:
   The records also indicate that Bush made good grades, scoring an 88 on total airmanship and earning perfect 100s for flying without navigational instruments, operating a T-38 System and studying applied aerodynamics. Other scores ranged from 89 in flight planning to 98 in aviation physiology.
 The new records are consistent with the President&amp;rsquo;s long-standing assertion that he trained regularly until 1972 when transfered to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign.

Interestingly, the 2 point bounce, according to the article on CNN.com, puts Bush at 52% to 45% for Kerry&amp;ndash;a seven point lead for Bush. I watch these polls, people, I can tell you that going into the convention, no on had Bush at 50%.

CNN: Buried on politics page
MSNBC: Buried on politics page
Why do I single out these two? Because CNN and Time own a joint website, as do MSNBC and Newsweek. Basically, CNN and NBC refuse to report the results of their own polls because, like spoiled, petulant children, the polls don&amp;rsquo;t show what they want them to show.

USA Today July 26, 2000:
 [T]he contrast with Texas Gov. Bush could hardly be sharper. From the beginning, Bush has relied on a hometown trio: chief strategist Karl Rove, campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and communications director Karen Hughes. Despite little experience in presidential campaigns, they have moved through this year&amp;rsquo;s difficult GOP primaries and into the general election winning credit, by and large, for being sure-footed and tight-lipped.

McCain did so for his own purposes and permanently destroy my faith in his character.)
Apparently, though, there are quite a few people who have reservations about the one of the Keating Five who never seems to get a mention with that group.

Again, I&amp;rsquo;m amazed at the similarities between descriptions of Kerry&amp;rsquo;s campaign problems and Al Gore&amp;rsquo;s four years ago. I&amp;rsquo;m sure Al Hunt and Howard Fineman mean to help Kerry with their fond descriptions of his thinking skills, but they are setting him up for failure by raising the bar too high.

Now, Al Hunt, in today&amp;rsquo;s Wall Street Journal, writes of a &amp;ldquo;major shake-up&amp;rdquo; coming in the Kerry campaign. (Remember all of Al Gore&amp;rsquo;s shake-ups?

                The most pro-violent, anti-American, anti-Western protests since the 1970s has begun in New York. The protesters are there to wish death to the President of the United States and all support or tolerate him. Yet protesters, whose web pages and speeches are filled with violent, murderous mayhem, won&amp;rsquo;t do the deed themselves. While talking a good game, these unemployed, over-educated, unbathed, nasty excuses for human beings are, in fact, cowards. They confront their enemies only in large numbers and with the protection of police, whom they claim to despise.

This letter is significant because Kerry&amp;rsquo;s defenders have claimed since the outset that none of the SwiftVets ever served onboard Kerry&amp;rsquo;s boat. The author of this letter was the Officer in Charge of the swiftboat that night&amp;ndash;Kerry&amp;rsquo;s senior officer who would have had to have signed the award recommendation.

They&amp;rsquo;re all college co-ed hysterical stuff: &amp;ldquo;You know, Bush is going to get us all killed because that he can be like king and stuff,&amp;rdquo; on the front, and &amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re one of those military guys, you&amp;rsquo;re doing the work of evil .

                Jim Lacey, in National Review Online, makes some excellent points about the same thing I&amp;rsquo;ve wondered for some time: where are all the terrorists?
After we invaded Afghanistan, we were told that tens of thousands of well-trained fanatics were scattered around the globe, increasing their danger and allowing them to recruit more members.
Well, three years later, where are they? Why haven&amp;rsquo;t they struck?
Mr. Lacey&amp;rsquo;s article is well worth reading as explores some possible answers to these questions.

   It&amp;rsquo;s bad enough that we couldn&amp;rsquo;t mourn our dead then. Now we see the same man that stood over the open graves of our brothers and pissed on their bodies is back. This time he&amp;rsquo;s dug up those bodies and is standing on them to give himself the stature for high office.

                Everyone knows that John F. Kerry refuses to allow anyone to view any part of his official military records. The Truth Laid Bear blog has found another Kerry cover-up: his contributors list.
Even though federal election law requires that candidates for all public office publicize their contributor list and how much each contributor gives, Kerry considers himself above the law. Bush, whose military records are public record, lists almost 100% of his contributors, while Kerry&amp;rsquo;s disclosure rate is in the mere 70s.

A logical person&amp;ndash;a professor of philosophy, let&amp;rsquo;s say, or math&amp;ndash;mush cringe trying to defend Kerry&amp;rsquo;s arguments that his service in Vietnam makes him more deserving of the office of the President of the United States than its current occupant.

Kerry and most Democrats consider the US to be the bad guys in Vietnam, and the US military the perpetrators of wrong for the advance of evil.

Kerry got no bounce from the DNC convention, but he will get 10 points from the swiftvets by this time next week. Bush will be down 12 when the GOP convention begins thanks to amateur political hacks who thought they could help their candidate.

                Okay, I know I&amp;rsquo;m risking looking like an idiot, but I&amp;rsquo;ll predict (with 16% of the precincts reporting) that Claire McCaskill will win the Democrat Gubernatorial primary in Missouri, defeating a failed, one-term governor who won primarily because his predecessor died a month before the election.
Bob Holden was a disaster as governor. He was outwitted by the Republican House Speaker at every turn. He seemed petty and unprepared for the office.

                You have selected the better candidate for governor. Why does a Republican care? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m also a Missourian. I must remind myself: What if the Democrat wins? On the chance that the next Missouri governor is a Democrat, I have to side with the best Democrat available. That may not be Claire McKaskill, but it sure as hell isn&amp;rsquo;t Bob Holden.
Whoever wins the general election, Missouri&amp;rsquo;s next governor will be better than its current one.

                Tom Ridge&amp;rsquo;s announcement that the US has specific threats from al qaeda came a shock to many. Yet it reminds that we are at war with people who want to destroy our way of life. They do not believe in co-existence, anymore than Soviet leaders did.
Some, like the French and most liberals, want to pretend that these zealots wish only to be left alone. They are wrong. It is us or them.

                Well, I was being facetious in my earlier post about Kerry suggesting we simply surrender to Al Qaeda. But, once again, no matter how ridiculous a conservative tries to be, he can&amp;rsquo;t top the way liberals really think.
John Kerry truly believes we should never had launched a war on terrorism. He&amp;rsquo;s not backing down on that stand.

                Last night was a big test. I passed, but there were a few anxious moments.
I took Angela to dinner at a fairly new, popular restaurant in Lafayette Square. Eleven Eleven Mississippi is modeled off of Northern California&amp;rsquo;s wine country bistros. It&amp;rsquo;s menu is excellent. It&amp;rsquo;s wine selection perfect. It&amp;rsquo;s prices reasonable.
This was the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve been &amp;ldquo;out&amp;rdquo; since quitting. My first smoke pangs occured just as we finished dinner.

                A union is trying to organize Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s programmers. The union is exploiting fear of off shoring to rally the workers.
Having worked in software engineering for a decade, but observed the utility of unions over 40 years, I strongly urge Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s employees to do some long, hard thinking before they sign up with the labor group.
Unions have been completely unable to stop off shoring in every industry they&amp;rsquo;ve tried. In fact, in steel, garments, and shoes, union activity accelerated the rates of job moves to overseas companies by making American workers more of a headache and more expensive.

                Bill&amp;rsquo;s comments move me to tears. Not having been on the stage since childhood (&amp;ldquo;Smallest Princess&amp;rdquo;, The King and I), I cannot speak to that, but I can try to describe the width and breadth of my pride in having been in on the labor and birth of such an awesome production.

                Make-up, lights, set, rehearsal, house: stage. Words that convey things to those with theatre in their blood and things very different to the rest of the world.
Friday night before the curtain felt like an opening. I was nervous. I thought back to my first play at DB: Blythe Spirit. In my first scene my character sipped a martini. On opening night, I was so nervous that the water&amp;rsquo;s surface looked like what I what later see from the bridge of a submarine: rolling waves breaking into white caps.

                23 years ago, I met Joe DiMercurio at auditions for his People&amp;rsquo;s Players production of Sound of Music. Over the next four years, he became one of my closest friends, particularly on stage.
Last night, after the thrill of a wonderful opering night, still buzzing from the excitement and the energy of the play, I found out that my haste in producing the program resulted in my omitting one of my best friend&amp;rsquo;s biography.

Mr. L surprised me with &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s say a prayer.&amp;rdquo;
Instantly, I remembered the routine practiced by every Catholic sports team, speech club, and theatre cast and crew before any important event: hands lain upon hand, bodies pressed against bodies, some stretching to reach, others bowing to accommodate. All together for one moment, humbly before God and man, asking for His blessing on what we are about to do.

I was so used to being in the wings when not on, I was afraid that I&amp;rsquo;d &amp;ldquo;lose&amp;rdquo; something being in a bright, comfortable, climate-controlled room, listening to the play over crackling speakers.

                Senator John Kerry turned down White House offers to receive briefings on the current terror risk assessment because he was too busy.
Last night on CNN&amp;rsquo;s Larry King Live, Kerry had this exchange (from Drudge):
   KING: News of the day, Tom Ridge warned today about al Qaeda plans of a large-scale attack on the United States. Didn&amp;rsquo;t increase the &amp;ndash; you see any politics in this? What&amp;rsquo;s your reaction?

                At a rally after announcing his pick for Veep, Senator John Kerry listed the things that make the Democrat ticket a better choice than the current administration. His final, and presumably, most important point:
&amp;ldquo;And we have better hair. And that goes a long way.&amp;rdquo;
Perhaps if the Senator wishes us to take him seriously as a presidential candidate, he should put down the mirror, stop kissing his VP nominee, and attend the terror assessment briefings offered by the White House.

                Yesterday (July 8), Tom Ridge called a press conference to inform the public that intelligence now exists strongly suggesting that Al Queda will launch a major terrorism act inside the United States in an attempt to &amp;ldquo;disrupt&amp;rdquo; (read, &amp;ldquo;help the Democrats win&amp;rdquo;) the November elections.
Almost immediately, evil bastards in the DNC and their minions in the press began a whipering campaign that Ridge was making up these reports in order draw attention away from John Kerry&amp;rsquo;s campaign.

US Jobless Claims Fall to Lowest Level Since 2000
There number of new claims for unemployment benefits fell, last week, by 39,000 to a four-year low. Yet all of the liberal media buried the story. Why? Because good economic news hurts Kerry&amp;rsquo;s chances of election, and the primary goal of the major news media in the US is to get him elected.

Personally, I was stunned by the news. The month when kids get out of school for the summer, resorts increase staff for vacation season, etc., should have seen a big number. I was siding with the more optimistic economists expecting 300,000&#43; new jobs.

Is it any surprise, really?

Let the story (that reinforces the press&amp;rsquo;s prejudices) fester for awhile. Finally, to maintian their own legitimacy, quietly leak the real story.

                Here&amp;rsquo;s something worth reading and pondering. 
Hat tip to Professor Bainbridge.
Too many Christians rely on the writings of modern scholars who, 200 years from now, may or may not be valid. We just don&amp;rsquo;t know. We do know, however, that Augustine and Aquinas remain valid. Trust the ancients for they have withstood the test of time.

                Once upon a time, when I was young and naive, I would have thought such a statement by a mass murderer would only help George Bush. But the attitudes of my fellow Americans, led by the cowardly liar Michael Moore (please sue me) has hardened my opinion of my neighbors. My guess is that this evening&amp;rsquo;s talk shows will host more than a few &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; pundits who will claim Saddam&amp;rsquo;s indictment of Bush proves Moore&amp;rsquo;s case&amp;ndash;that Bush is in fact a criminal.

                This forum provides neither the time nor the space for one to adequately thank, or even mention, all of the debts owed William F. Buckley Jr. He holds markers for the world, the country, journalism, conservatism, and me and millions like me. Thankfully, Buckley&amp;rsquo;s collection methods are, at most, mild, like his disposition.
I have been in a room with Mr. Buckley but once, and it remains one of the highlights of my life.

                Even as gasoline prices continue to fall, I am furious about the synchronization of traffic signals in my part of the world.
Once upon a time, municipalities synchronized traffic signals so that a vehicle moving at or about the speed limit would be stopped by a red light very infrequently, usually once while on that particular road. Apparently, St. Louis County, Missouri has abandoned that practice.
Last night, I had to stop for 7 of 9 signals in a 4 mile stretch approaching my home.

                The 9th Circuit&amp;rsquo;s ruling held that the federal marijuana laws did not apply to medicinal use of marijuana in two specific cases. As you should know, the Constitution prohibits Congress from making laws on matters that lie outside its enumerated powers, which are very limited. One of those powers, though, known as the commerce clause, gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. The commerce clause has become the conduit for Congressional abuse of the states and of the people.

                Reading reminders of the hatred for Ronald Reagan (now the most beloved former president in US history), offers a lesson for President Bush and the American people.
During his administration, Reagan repeatedly did what he felt was right or necessary at the expense of his personal and political popularity. He was truly hated in Europe and in American institutions of higher learning. Yet his confident and brave pursuit of good won both the political and the moral battles of the time and of history.

                Julia Smillie wonders if technology and blogging has doomed writers.
 Mediocre writing always had a following, even though it didn&amp;rsquo;t transcend eras. Good writing still sells and IS read, while bad writing sells and sits. When I first started trying to get published in the 1980s, I read The Writer and Writer&amp;rsquo;s Digest religiously. Almost every issue contained at least one column or article that said this exact same thing.

                I recently had an experience with a social services agency that paints an unfriedly face for the organization.
Almost Home, run by the Franciscan Sisters of St. Mary, provides teen mothers with the chance to make a better life for themselves and their children. In exchange for going to school, remaining free from drugs, establishing the norms of social achievement (job, daycare, financial assistance, child-rearing skills, etc.), the women and their babies have a safe, comfortable place to live, help with their children, etc.

I even sent Target gift cards to the center so some of the young women could buy small gifts for their kids, or something for themselves.

Overhead lights illuminated the oracle on her seat and spilled onto the guards, but the rest of the room was invisible. Before me lay large double doors. I could see light fighting to enter around the great doors&amp;rsquo; edges. As I walked toward the light, the doors began to open slowly, admitting more light. I could see that pottery and artifacts stood on display pedestals all around the room, whose charcoal gray ceiling stood at least forty feet above me.

It doesn&amp;rsquo;t separate Buchanan from Goldberg. And we conservative, including those of us who formerly wrote for NR on CompuServe, couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less.

                Can anyone look upon the fading figure of John Kerry without feeling a sense of pity as for a man who&amp;rsquo;s lost his family and home? His serious face, always looking a bit pained with concern, now expresses a sad displeasure for life itself. To make matters worse, Howard Dean, the child politician &amp;ndash; childlike in size, bearing, countenance, temperament, mentality, and world view &amp;ndash; has not only stolen Kerry&amp;rsquo;s media-given title of Man to Beat, he has now taken Kerry&amp;rsquo;s Biblical allusion: Job.

                Hey, I think I was too quick to judge the Dean on Religion article in the Washington Post. I felt that the reporter, Jim VandeHei, was soft on Dean and failed to analyze or even characterize the veracity of the doctor&amp;rsquo;s statements on religion. Having re-read the article, I have a new perspective. (Hey, I&amp;rsquo;ve been celebrating the holidays, and the mind isn&amp;rsquo;t quite up to full speed.)

                I found this on Drudge. I offer a contrarian explanation, however. Perhaps the feminization of men&amp;ndash;mandatorily sitting to urinate in pre-schools, supporting Howard Dean&amp;ndash;is reducing the amount of testosterone men produce. I&amp;rsquo;d like to see a study that measures the sperm count in deficient men before and after a weekend movie marathon of The Godfather I and II, Patton, Braveheart, The Patriot (Mel Gibson&amp;rsquo;s), and Band of Brothers (all 10 episodes).

Combine the Yankee Power/Homeland Security issue with Dr. Dean&amp;rsquo;s secret energy policy meetings, and you begin to see that money talks with the good doctor, as does he from both sides of his mouth.
Also, have you noticed that the big magazines, Time and Newsweek, are starting to question the Dean phenomenon?

 &amp;ldquo;I am still learning a lot about faith and the South and how important it is,&amp;rdquo; said Dean, a Congregationalist. The Congregationalist Church is a Christian denomination that preaches a personal relationship with God without a strong hierarchal structure guiding it. Dean was reared an Episcopalian, but left the church 25 years ago in a dispute with a local Vermont church over efforts to build a bike path.

According to the Associated Press, Dean, who criticizes the Bush Administration&amp;rsquo;s war on terror nearly every day, underfunded critical programs to secure the nuclear plant even after September 11.
 &amp;ldquo;During Dean&amp;rsquo;s final year in office in 2002, an audit concluded that despite a decade of repeated warnings of poor safety at Vermont Yankee, Dean&amp;rsquo;s administration was poorly prepared for a nuclear disaster,&amp;rdquo; the AP story said

                Ryan Lizza of The New Republic went to a Dean house party on December 30. His report is worth reading, and it jibes with my own research into the house parties.
On December 28, I decided to see which of my neighbors might be hosting a Dean house party. Like Lizza, I was curious and wanted to attend one as a non-Deaniac observer. While Lizza, who lives in the DC area, had about 30 parties to choose from, pickings were slim in St.

                Deaniacs send money to the Dean campaign whenever there&amp;rsquo;s a negative story about their candidate. (The fact that this method raised $15 million in three months says something about Dean, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what.) I propose that readers donate $5.00 to this blog every time Dr. Dean says something stupid. The money will be used to improve the site, allow me more time to research and write, and, if Dean remains on the front pages until November, let me retire a wealthy man this time next year.

I would add my own rebuttal to Dean&amp;rsquo;s comments, but between Kaus&amp;rsquo;s analysis and Dean&amp;rsquo;s own political stupidity and pathological carelessness, I really can&amp;rsquo;t make this any more damaging to the good doctor&amp;rsquo;s faultering reputation.

                Just a quick rundown of top economic stories on this first business day of the new year:
Manufacturing grew at its fastest pace in 20 years (since the Reagan administration) in December.
Hiring will pick up in 2004 according to economists, with unemployment dropping .5% to 5.5% by November (as per my 2004 Predictions).
Stock markets are up across the board, with Dow and NASDAQ safely above 10000 and 2000, respectively.

                Steve Moore of the Club for Growth has an excellent analysis of Howard Dean&amp;rsquo;s proposed tax increases. An excellent summary:
_The Dean plan, our ad notes, would raise taxes by $2,472 a year on a typical middle-income family of four. Mr. Dean would also raise the death tax rate, the capital gains tax rate, the dividend tax rate and the payroll tax, and he would bring back the hated marriage tax penalty that President Bush abolished this year.

                It is easy to get young people riled up, as William F. Buckely points out. The Dean house parties, rallies, $2 donations, etc., are the kinds of things young people like to do. And there is no doubt that Dean has energized a particular demographic group, namely, the 18- to 24-year-old folk.
Last week, Dr. Dean warned the DNC chairman that, if the other Democrat candidates don&amp;rsquo;t stop attacking Dean, Dean&amp;rsquo;s supporters might not vote at all come November 2004.

                The New Year begins with&amp;ndash;guess what&amp;ndash;Howard Dean saying something stupid. Thankfully, John F**ing Kerry has called him on it.
Dean&amp;rsquo;s inability to research his statements before making them&amp;ndash;like finding out how Kerry voted&amp;ndash;makes you wonder what kind of a doctor he was. Did he prescribe medication before checking the patient&amp;rsquo;s allergies? Did he prescribe procedures without determining if that procedure remained the recommended treatment? In other words, was he as intellectually lazy as a physician as he is as a politician?

                With the possible exception of phrenology, nothing has produced more false, even fraudulent science than has environmentalism. Scientists of various sorts with otherwise solid credentials have, for years, allowed their own political biases bastardize results of scientific inquiry in order to &amp;ldquo;prove&amp;rdquo; what is not provable or lacks valid scientific evidence.
Moreover, people, particularly procreative baby boomers and the generation that followed, believes such nonsense without critical questioning. Author Michael Crichton, himself an environmentalist and scientist, has had enough.

                Wildwood, MO—A Wildwood man is disappointed that a home improvement project proved more difficult than expected.
William Hennessy began a project to remove wallpaper and paint the master bedroom in his house in the Westglen Farms subdivision in Wildwood. Shortly after starting the job, he learned that, what he expected to take to hours, would take more than a day.
“According to the guy at Home Depot, this was a slam dunk,” said the unemployed software architect.

Back in 1973, I remember my father coming home from his monthly Mens Club meeting at Epiphany of Our Lord Catholic Church in St. Louis with tears still streaking down his cheeks. Being the kind of man he is, he tried to hide them from the kids. I cant believe I fought two wars for this country, only to have those bastards send us all to hell, he told my mother in the kitchen.
