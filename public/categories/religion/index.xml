      <description>Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats could be headed toward a final showdown over abortion and the right of men and women to choose their moral direction.
Obama has promised in bold and belligerent words to make the Freedom of Choice Act his first, most important act as President. Consistent with his lifelong passion for encouraging abortion, even encouraging his daughters to have abortions, Obama&amp;rsquo;s first act as President will be to drive a permanent wedge between the United States and the Catholic church.</description>

      <title>We&#39;re All Communists Now *************</title>

      <description>Ignorance is no defense.
Americans, faced with the choice of Marxist-socialism or republican-capitalism, a plurality chose communism.
Their moral weakness, combined with viral corruption of character, has created a majority coalition of indecisive morons known as independents, children who want government to make their decisions and butter their bread, and neo-Marxists, like Obama. We fought the Cold War for nothing.
Over the next two years, we will see the most complete change in a nation seen since the Bolshevik Revolution nearly 100 years ago in Russia:</description>

      <description>And let perpetual light shine upon her. May her soul and all the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace.
To Obama and his family, my condolences.
This is personal; it isn&amp;rsquo;t business.

      <title>A Call for a Rosary Novena</title>

      <description>Among the most important titles we have in the Catholic Church for the Blessed Virgin Mary are Our Lady of Victory and Our Lady of the Rosary. These titles can be traced back to one of the most decisive times in the history of the world and Christendom. The Battle of Lepanto took place on October 7 (date of feast of Our Lady of Rosary), 1571. This proved to be the most crucial battle for the Christian forces against the radical Muslim navy of Turkey.</description>

      <title>It&#39;s Late and I&#39;m Bored</title>

      <description>so this will be my only post&amp;ndash;a series of thoughts on the day.
Financial Armageddon
In case you were too busy with your normal life and missed it, the financial armageddon promised/threatened by President Bush, Nancy Pelosi, Hank Paulson, and every other power freak on the planet failed to materialize. The Dow ended up 485 points, erasing well over half of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s losses. Before Congress does something stupid, let&amp;rsquo;s just see what happens if we, the people, are left to our own devices&amp;ndash;the way the founders planned it and the way it worked for 150 years before do-gooder morons fucked everything up.</description>

      <title>Ignorant Professor Wendy Doniger</title>

      <description>The Washington Post wasted ink and tree on the ignorant scribblings of tortured and angry woman named Wendy Doniger. Doniger is an infanticidal maniac&amp;ndash;one of those NAGs who believes that every possible abortion should happen. (H/T Allahpundit)
I emailed her this reaction directly. I hope she prints it off and chokes on it.

  Dear Prof. Doniger:
 You committed an egregious moral error in the last paragraph of your inhumane and profane attack on Sarah Palin.</description>

      <title>Biden:  &#34;Life Begins At Conception&#34;</title>

      <description>Senator and VP candidate Joe Biden today broke from the DNC and from Barack Obama declaring his belief that life begins at conception, according to the New York Times.
Biden must have a very difficult time reconciling that belief with his public support of abortion rights. If he truly believes that life begins at conception, supporting abortion under and circumstances is tantamount to advocating murder.
Biden admits that he cannot fully reconcile the two opposing views:</description>

      <title>Media Hit Rock Bottom Over Palin</title>

      <description>Michelle Malkin calls is &amp;ldquo;Palin Derangement Syndrome.&amp;rdquo; William F. Buckley called it &amp;ldquo;liberal mania.&amp;rdquo; I call it &amp;ldquo;angry cynicism.&amp;rdquo; Call it what you will, the leftist media&amp;rsquo;s treatment of Sarah Palin and her family is an embarrassment to the country and felony indictment of the journalism industry in America.
Only Hurricane Gustav&amp;rsquo;s untimely arrival spared us from 24 hours of Bristol Palin&amp;rsquo;s sex life on CNN. Every political/talk host on the network devoted the majority of his show to the subject.</description>

      <title>Pro-Choice Veep?  Simmer down</title>

      <description>Many on the right claim they&amp;rsquo;ll vote Democrat if McCain chooses a pro-choice veep.
I&amp;rsquo;m as anti-abortion as anyone on the planet. I think my perseverating brethren need to learn their conservative roots.
George H. W. Bush was pro-choice when Regan chose him as veep.
Settle down, Michelle. McCain&amp;rsquo;s White House would be more pro-life than Obama&amp;rsquo;s. Take what you can get.</description>

      <title>The Absolution Candidate</title>

      <description>Rush Limbaugh came close, today, to a telling insight into the left&amp;rsquo;s love of Obama. He finished short. Let me complete Rush&amp;rsquo;s thought: The left worship Obama hoping for absolution and salvation.
Absolution is a big thing to a Catholic. It&amp;rsquo;s the difference between Heaven and Hell. Absolution comes only from God through His son Jesus Christ&amp;rsquo;s death and resurrection. The Messiah paved the way.
The left&amp;rsquo;s deification of Obama stands on its own.</description>

      <description>Pope Benedict XVI will receive the highest honor the United States can bestow upon on a visiting head of state: the President will meet him at the airport. Afterwards, the White House will host the largest gathering of Bush&amp;rsquo;s presidency, as over 12,000 guests will receive His Holiness. Quite an honor.
Sadly, Catholic hate mobs will be out in force, too. Excommunicates who believe they know God&amp;rsquo;s designs for the church better than the Pope will travel from St.</description>
