      <description>Get into the spirit of ‘76 with a great live musical You probably didn’t know that I was a theatre guy in high school and college. In fact, I was a theatre major for a couple of years. I think the right’s neglect of the arts is one of our biggest failings. The arts reach people at an emotional level. Intellectual arguments cannot change emotional attachments.
So here’s a chance to rev up your American patriotic spirits while connecting with the arts.</description>

      <title>Maybe It’s the New Season of Mad Men</title>

      <description>This post is a bit unusual for me.
Strange and disturbing thoughts crowded my mind tonight—Sunday, March 7.
These thoughts interrupted my television viewing. I couldn’t really focus. Then, I couldn’t sleep. The thoughts won’t rest, and they won’t give me rest. So I write.
I’m bewildered by the world’s stock markets. Someone told the Wall Street Journal that, sure, the US economy seems to be tanking, manufacturing’s falling, the labor rate’s in the toilet.</description>

      <description>Just because it’s after 10:00 am, doesn’t mean you can’t come to the 3rd Anniversary Tea Party.
No, we didn’t come up with a policy for people who arrive late to the feast. We will find a way to get you involved that’s fair to everyone.
Grab your laptop or your mobile device, if you have one, get in your car, and drive to the Crowne Plaza in Clayton. Ask for the Tea Party.</description>

      <description>The 3rd Anniversary Tea Party begins tonight at 6:30 at the Crowne Plaza in Clayton.
You can make a difference. But not alone. If you join forces with just three other people, you’ll triple your influence.
Show up. Bring two friends. Leave with a company a soldiers for the America’s liberation.</description>

      <title>Why Attend the 3rd Anniversary Tea Party</title>
      <link>https://hennessysview.com/2012/02/23/why-attend-the-3rd-anniversary-tea-party-2/</link>

      <description>Yes, I’ve written about little else. The 3rd Anniversary Tea Party is something of an obsession with me. And for good reasons: * Obama is surging * Apathy has seized the right * America’s future hangs in the balance
But there’s a much bigger reason you—you, the person reading this blog—should attend the 3rd Anniversary Tea Party.
That reason is personal, powerful, and acute.
That reason is this:You cannot live with yourself if Obama wins and you failed to do everything in your power to stop him.</description>
