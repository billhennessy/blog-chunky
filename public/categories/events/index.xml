      <description>Get into the spirit of ‘76 with a great live musical You probably didn’t know that I was a theatre guy in high school and college. In fact, I was a theatre major for a couple of years. I think the right’s neglect of the arts is one of our biggest failings. The arts reach people at an emotional level. Intellectual arguments cannot change emotional attachments.
So here’s a chance to rev up your American patriotic spirits while connecting with the arts.</description>
