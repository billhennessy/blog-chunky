      <description>When Reagan was president, we wanted him to hit back harder on the press. We wanted him to put Sam Donaldson in his place. We wanted him to call out the fake news.

      <title>Sean Spicer and the White House Press Corp Proved Me 100% Right</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s great to be right.
Yesterday I told you that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer played the White House press corps by telling the truth. But the press corps and many Americans have a psychosis that literally replaces some words with other words. It&amp;rsquo;s not dyslexia. It&amp;rsquo;s far worse because it&amp;rsquo;s selective.
In this case, Spicer said &amp;ldquo;witness&amp;rdquo; but journalists everywhere repeated, &amp;ldquo;attend.&amp;rdquo; I wrote about it here.
Well, today, Spicer explained the situation to a psychotic journalist almost the same way I did.</description>

      <title>How to Spot Journalism&#39;s Psychosis</title>

      <description>When your brain automatically alters perceptions, there&amp;rsquo;s something wrong with you.
Reporters have this psychosis. Journalists. They have very bad ADHD it seems. They can&amp;rsquo;t pay attention. Like kids with ADHD. Chuck Todd and everybody at Business Insider should probably take Ritalin or something.
Reporters are also narcissists. No one goes into journalism unless they have a pathologically inflated ego. No one.
So I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk you through the proof, slowly, so even our narcissistic, hyperactive, attention-deficit-disordered journalists can understand that Sean Spicer played with them like a cat pawing a dying moth.</description>

      <title>What Do Post Dispatch Reporters and Penn State Have in Common?</title>

      <description>Like the Penn State athletic department, most St. Louis news media covered up a sex crime in order to protect an organization they love.
The St. Louis Post Dispatch, KTVI 2 and KPLR 11, and KSDK 5 each failed to report a sexual assault that took place at the illegal OccupySTL squatters&amp;rsquo; village in Kiener Plaza last week.
The assault came to light only because a citizen-journalist, the POed Patriot, monitors the police crime map.</description>

      <description>I try not to ask for much. Okay, maybe that’s not true, but I’m going to ask you a favor, anyway. Mark this down: **7:00 pm, Saturday, October 1. **
It’s weird, I know. But I’m asking for three presents in one.
First, my mom and dad celebrate their wedding anniversary this week. (62nd?) Second, my wife and I celebrate our wedding anniversary this week. Third, next week is my birthday.</description>
