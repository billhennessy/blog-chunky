      <description>DailyTech - Sea Ice Ends Year at Same Level as 1979
 Thanks to a rapid rebound in recent months, global sea ice levels now equal those seen 29 years ago, when the year 1979 also drew to a close.
 Let&amp;rsquo;s give credit where it&amp;rsquo;s due: Al Gore.
When Al Gore speaks, the opposite happens. Where Al Gore goes,snow is sure to follow. So when Al Gorefrightened a bunch of German kids by telling them that the North Pole would be gone in 5 years, that Santa Claus would die along with his reindeer, and that Polar Bears would either become extinct or catch the last few ice floes south to Europe where they&amp;rsquo;d &amp;ldquo;eat little kiddies like you,&amp;rdquo; you just knew that the Arctic would grow ice faster than Joe Biden&amp;rsquo;s head grows hair plugs.</description>

      <description>Even as CO2 levels rise, western Lake Superior is freezing over for the first time years.
 The western tip of Lake Superior has frozen over in December for the first time in recent memory, and that could mean a long season of ice angling that hasn’t been seen in years.
 “We were just talking that it’s been something like 17 years since we had a good, long ice fishing season at this corner of Lake Superior,’’ said Russ Francisco, owner of Marine General sporting goods store in Duluth.</description>

      <description>Winter madness
MSNBC.com lea  ds off this Sunday with a photo montage of serious winter weather from Pacific to Maine. To the left, all snow, all winter weather is &amp;ldquo;freak.&amp;quot; To those of us with memories longer than our . . . privates . . . and a sense of history that exceeds our senses of fashion, winters are beginning to look a like winters past. The temperature was 7 when I got up this morning.</description>

      <description>Even liberals are noticing that [global warming has been reversed](Can you explain the enormous hole in Earth&amp;rsquo;s magnetic field that allowed solar winds to flood our personal space on June 3, 2007? ).
  No doubt Gore and The One will take credit.
