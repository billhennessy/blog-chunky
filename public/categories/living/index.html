                Go ahead and wear a mask, especially if a merchant requires you to, or if not wearing a mask will cause someone undue anxiety. It&amp;rsquo;s charitable.
Also, if you&amp;rsquo;re highly active (get out a lot), you should probably wear a mask and wash your hands if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be around people who are more likely to suffer severely from Coronavirus: the elderly, the obese, people with chronic conditions. While we&amp;rsquo;re at it, basic practices our grandmothers taught us should always apply:

                The most humanane approach to Coronavirus is to let it spread without overwhelming the hospitals in any location. Mitigation orders, such as wearing masks, stay-at-home orders, and maintaining six feet of distance, while well-intentioned, actually prolong the agony, except when required in places that are in danger of overwhelming the hospital system.
The idea that we can maintain this near-complete shutdown of society for as long as Coronavirus exists is a recipe for disaster on a Biblical scale.

There will be a stimulus, but it will not come from Congress. The fourth stimulus will come from you and me.
There are three reasons for this, which I will get to in a moment. But, first, do me a favor: Please share this post with your members of Congress. It&amp;rsquo;s that important.

                An ice cream parlor in Massachusetts closed one day after re-opening because customers treated his employees like dirt.
Owner Mark Lawrence told Fox25 Boston, via Fox News:
 “People have forgotten how to treat other human beings in the six or seven weeks that they’ve been confined to their homes,” he told the station. “They have no clue how to respect other human beings.”
 After just one day, Lawrence closed his shop.

                Nate Silver let the cat out of the bag.
In case you don&amp;rsquo;t recognize his name, Nate Silver is the data analyst who launched Five Thirty-Eight, orignally in the New York Times. He was famous for not predicting an election a few years ago.
Today, Nate unloaded on the media for just one aspect of their narrative-driven Coronavirus coverage. In short, noted the same thing Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View pointed out a month ago: positive tests is meaningless unless it&amp;rsquo;s indexed to the number of tests administered.

The latest tactic of the Doomsday Doctors is to report (non-peer reviewed) that the Coronavirus has mutated into a weapons-grade killer that no one can avoid or resist.

 Science is facing a &amp;ldquo;reproducibility crisis&amp;rdquo; where more than two-thirds of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist&amp;rsquo;s experiments, research suggests.
 Two years earlier, in 2015, a major study found the same problem, with nearly the same numbers, involving psychology.

                Coronavirus could wipe out the open office floor plan as quickly and decisively as it wiped out many corporate bottom lines.
Companies that move to an open office cite two benefits for the design:
  Cost savings by cramming more people into a given amount of space.
  Increased innovation, driven by collaboration.
  But multiple studies show that both assumptions are wrong. Now, Coronavirus has proven that open offices represent a significant public health threat, as well.

You can call that Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s Law, and Coronavirus is proving this law iron clad. Iron clad.
The latest confirmation of Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s Law just completed.
In March, Donald Trump and others said that warm weather would diminish the spread of Coronavirus, just as it diminishes the flu. The reason: virus that survive well in cool, dry conditions don&amp;rsquo;t do well in warm, humid conditions.

                I know President Trump mocks the idea of herd immunity, but there&amp;rsquo;s really no other option absent a vaccine. And if we keep in lockdown until a vaccine is widely available, millions will die from the collapsed economy and collapsed infrastructure.
What makes Coronavirus more dangerous than flu is lack of immune people.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say that both kill about .01 to .02 percent of everyone who catches them, just for argument&amp;rsquo;s sake.

The headlines and stories are clearly intended to make people panic. The media want people to stay locked in their homes, and they want people to demand that government keeps the brave locked in their homes, as well.

  Source: The Covid Tracking Project
Key Insight: For every week, Hospitalization rate decreases by about 9.19%.
From My Original Tweet The most important number regarding Coronavirus is a number none of the tracking sites or governments will tell you: acceleration. Lower acceleration of hospitalization and deaths is good. It means the number of new incidents yesterday was smaller than the new incidents from the day before.

                Wearing masks in public will change the way people behave, and the consequences for society could be devastating.
The White House released the plan to Open America Again. It&amp;rsquo;s reasonable, 3-phase plan that relaxes Coronavirus restrictions in 14-day increments. As a state achieves certain metrics, based on CDC surveillance data, it advances to the next phase.
Phases one and two allow increased activity with the recommendation of requiring face masks when in confined public places like work.

It is a visual representation of the death toll from various plagues throughout history (most of which originated in China), including COVID-19 (which originated in China).
You will notice that COVID-19 is a rather mundane specimen. As of April 10, its death toll fell somewhere between the Yellow Fever of the late 1800s and Ebola of 2014-2015.

                Models failed. Miserably.
The IHME models the CDC used as their primary source to justify the destruction of President Trump&amp;rsquo;s beautiful economy turned out to be no better than guesses from three drunks at a bar. The IHME factored in strict mitigation (lockdown), but they still over estimated everything by factors as high as 40.
That models were unbelievably bad is not open to debate. The models were hideously bad.

Modley fired Captain Brett Crozier after Crozier&amp;rsquo;s letter to a wide distribution list appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle.

When real life tells us a story, our minds will mold the facts to fit our desired storylines. In other words, we will create a hero and a villain for every story, even if there aren&amp;rsquo;t any.
As we retell our semi-fictionalized story to ourselves or others, we pad the hero&amp;rsquo;s character and tarnish the villain&amp;rsquo;s with each telling.

 It doesn’t matter that the United States surpassed China this week in reported Covid-19 cases because those numbers (83,507 and 81,782 respectively as of March 26) don’t tell us how many people actually became infected in either country.

                Hysterical headlines scream about the number of new coronavirus infections every hour. This is a mistake. Ignore those headlines. Number of confirmed cases will rise as number of people tested rises. If we tested everyone for the flu, the number of confirmed flu cases would be astronomical.
Doing some casual analysis, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious what drives the death rate: the number of hospitalizations in a given geographic area.
Last week I pointed out that mean averages are meaningless, even destructive if used to project into the future.

                Newspapers are lying to you. They&amp;rsquo;re feeding you ads pretending it&amp;rsquo;s news.
The headlines are not only false, they&amp;rsquo;re dangerous. And wrong.
The most common such lie goes like this: &amp;ldquo;Best Streaming Service For Shelter in Place&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s What to Binge Watch While Locked Down&amp;rdquo;
Here&amp;rsquo;s the truth: we will not emerge from the coronavirus crisis stronger or better if we spend this time doing what we&amp;rsquo;ve always done.

                When you hear &amp;ldquo;coronavirus&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;COVID-19,&amp;rdquo; you probably think of words like fear, disruption, recession, sick, death, inconvenient, and maybe even China.
What if every time you hear &amp;ldquo;coronavirus,&amp;rdquo; you automatically think &amp;ldquo;gratitude?&amp;rdquo;
How do you feel when you feel grateful?
Most people associate feeling grateful with relief, appreciation, happiness, joy, and safety. Good feelings.
Now, why are you grateful for coronavirus?
That&amp;rsquo;s completely up to you. But I bet you can list just two reasons for being grateful for coronavirus.

                You might have heard mention of the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918 to 1919. Being the great-grandson of a doctor who came out of retirement to assist with St. Louis&amp;rsquo;s response to that epidemic, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d should share a little information about the differences and similarities between the Spanish Flu and coronavirus. I&amp;rsquo;ll briefly cover both the diseases and the responses.
 Note: The word &amp;ldquo;pandemic&amp;rdquo; was unknown in 1918, so contemporaneous references to the disease used the term &amp;ldquo;epidemic.

                Horses are prey to many species. Their behavior, their physiology, is that of a beast under constant threat from, usually, smaller, less beautiful organisms.
Yet, wild horses capture our imaginations. Their grace and beauty, their power, and their gentleness reminds us of what we would be if we lived into our highest ideals for ourselves. We would be worthy of our sufferings.

When dealing with an epidemic, we need to consider two things:
 Current numbers are not very useful. Effects are non-linear.  Beware Current Numbers The first argument I hear from those who wish we&amp;rsquo;d just go on with life as usual involves current statistics: number of confirmed cases, number of dead, etc.

Senator Martha McSally told Judge Jeanine tonight that the next problem to solve in the coronavirus testing problem is the first mile. We have plenty of labs ready to accept specimens, but getting the specimens from the drive-thru test centers to a drop-off point, say a post office or Fedex drop.
Perhaps people could be enlisted to serve as couriers of these specimens.

Now, there&amp;rsquo;s really no empirical reason to stock up on food and water. But there is a psychological/economic reason: the Common Knowledge game.
Common Knowledge is something everyone knows everyone knows. When something becomes Common Knowledge, most people will behave as if the &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; were true, if it is not. Stock markets are perfect example of Common Knowledge games.

                Long ago in South St. Louis Mom and Dad would go to an early Mass on Sundays. Maybe 6:30, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. Anyway, it was early. They&amp;rsquo;d bring home donuts from Donut Drive-In on Chippewa.
But between the time they left for Mass and the time they returned with donuts, us kids would get into mischief. As I remember it, my oldest sister, Tee, started it.
Tee would come downstairs, go straight to the ice box, open the freezer, pull out the newish carton of Neapolitan ice cream (&amp;ldquo;newish&amp;rdquo; because Mom and Dad shopped on Thursdays), and stand over the sink eating it with a big spoon straight from the carton.

                I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to write a book called How to Lose Friends and Alienate People. But nobody reads autobiographies anymore. So I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you how to be unpopular, instead.
Being unpopular is pretty easy. And it&amp;rsquo;s hard, too. It&amp;rsquo;s easy because there&amp;rsquo;s only one rule, which we&amp;rsquo;ll get to in a moment. It&amp;rsquo;s hard for two reasons: beforehand, it&amp;rsquo;s scary to think about following the rule. Afterwards, it&amp;rsquo;s lonely and painful to have followed the rule.

I followed George Gilder closely for many years back in the mid-1990s.

Plus, managing a blog through Github is actually easier for me. I use git professionally. And I pretty much think in Markdown at this point.
The final reason for the move is the change in direction for this blog.

Don&amp;rsquo;t take this lightly. Father Richard Heilman and folks at the Holy League have asked Christians to pray the Lorica of St. Patrick for Justice Kavanaugh, substituting &amp;ldquo;Brett Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Justice Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; for the first person pronouns.

A 54-day novena for our nation. It ends on October 7 with the Rosary Coast-to-Coast. Which means it started before I learned of either. But that&amp;rsquo;s okay. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to do the novena to do say the Rosary. Just show up at any of the Rosary stations around the area at 3:00 on October 7. I&amp;rsquo;m helping organize one location at the Black Madonna Shrine in Eureka/Pacific area.

                One man can confirm or deny the central allegation against Pope Francis. The Catholic Church needs that man to step up now.
In an 11-page letter by former US Nuncio (ambassador) Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, Pope Francis is accused of ignoring warnings about Cardinal Timothy McCarrick. Viganò claims he personally delivered the warning to Pope Francis in 2013. The pope allegedly ignored the warning and the dossier on McCarrick in 2013.

 Pope Francis ignored evidence of crimes and overturned punishment imposed by Pope Benedict on the wicked and disgraced Cardinal McCarrick. That&amp;rsquo;s according to a former papal nuncio and corroborated by a former first counselor to the nunciature to the United States speaking on the record. The two men have direct knowledge of the matter.
Pope Francis refused to comment on the allegations that he personally covered up McCarrick&amp;rsquo;s crimes.

Today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel reading comes from John 6. John chapter 6 is all about the bread of life. In it, Jesus shocks his Jewish followers by announcing that they must eat his flesh and drink his blood to achieve eternal life.
When some of his disciples challenged this formula for immortality, Jesus doubled down, saying:
 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.

                It&amp;rsquo;s Friday, and our archbishop in St. Louis has done a great thing. (Maybe today would be a good time to thank a priest. Give him encouragement.) But the town blog used deception to report the story.
Archbishop Robert Carlson of St. Louis asked Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Attorney General, Josh Hawley, to review all of the archdiocese&amp;rsquo;s records regarding abuse cases. Hawley agreed to the Archbishop&amp;rsquo;s request.
Archbishop Carlson deserves our praise and respect for his openness and honesty.

                Because of my sinfulness and selfishness, I was out of communion with the blessed sacrament for most of my adult life. To anyone who&amp;rsquo;s never been excommunicated, you cannot imagine the pain and humiliation of being in that state.
Being a coward, I avoided mass. I was too embarrassed. Week after week, my neighbors would see me not going to communion. I&amp;rsquo;d have to get up and let the communicants through, then kneel back down, often alone.

                Last week, Pope Francis approved a change to the Catechism of the Catholic Church.
Longtime readers might recall that my views on the death penalty are a bit nuanced. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t always have the courage to express it.
In 2014, I wrote:
 I don’t buy the idea that the death penalty is no deterrent. I don’t buy the notion that the death penalty should be banned. I think the availability of such a punishment serves its purpose.

Neither did I. But when I heard this on EWTN Radio the other day, I remembered there are two translations of the Beatitudes. One version goes with &amp;ldquo;Blessed are . . .&amp;rdquo; and the other with &amp;ldquo;Happy are . . . .&amp;rdquo; So, I guess it&amp;rsquo;s true. The words are interchangeable.
Happiness, then, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean walking around in some lithium-induced state of bliss.

                Many years ago, a company hired a new president.
After several months on the job, this new president learned that most of his employees couldn&amp;rsquo;t pick him out of a line-up. He spent so much time in his office or in meetings or traveling that he rarely met with the people who reported to him.
To fix this problem, he set up a series of lunches. They were off-site at restaurants around town.

If I&amp;rsquo;m right about politicians being 100% true to their constituents, then why are so many voters so unhappy with the people they voted for? It&amp;rsquo;s simple: the voters aren&amp;rsquo;t every politician&amp;rsquo;s constituents. That&amp;rsquo;s right. Not all politicians consider the people who vote for them constituents.

Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve answered, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the limits of data science in 2018.
The best data scientists in the world agreed with nearly absolute certainty. These scientists determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hillary Clinton would be the 45th President of the United States. That was in 2016.
Those scientists were wrong.

                People want cover. Danger drives us together.
It&amp;rsquo;s our nature. Our herding response gave our species an advantage. The herders lived to breed. The wanderers, the stragglers, fell prey. Genes of herders increased. Genes of loners receded.
But our strongest cover is our parents. They&amp;rsquo;re the protection we seek.
The pair of humans who brought us into the world provide the best cover. We are born helpless. Our parents sustain us.

                Do you follow the recommended diets? Low fat. High carbohydrate? Eat lots of fruit?
If so, you&amp;rsquo;re probably overweight. And your blood tests are probably a mess. Maybe your doctor recommends expensive prescriptions to lower your cholesterol.
A new study finds the problem is not your fault. Your doctor, poorly educated in nutrition, and government recommendations, prompted by industry lobbyists, are designed to keep you fat and sick. And it&amp;rsquo;s not just US government.

Persuasion doesn&amp;rsquo;t work like that. But it also does. Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: if you ask me to persuade you to give me a hundred bucks, you already want to give me a hundred bucks.

And Braddock&amp;rsquo;s first step after choosing an end: what comes immediately before. That&amp;rsquo;s where we are today.
A few weeks back, I wrote several posts about diet (here and here). I warned you that the government and doctors and, especially, dieticians have been poising us for years.

Each generation looks at its wars and finds something final, but the end never comes. Memorials never end while man roams the earth.

Notice the natural humanity in Reagan&amp;rsquo;s words. He didn&amp;rsquo;t browbeat people with abstract concepts like the Constitution or liberty. Instead, he spoke about the real lives of ordinary Americans. And the everyday life of an America that lived up to its ideal. And notice the complete lack of pomposity, vanity, and vulgarity so prevalent in the frontrunners of 2016.

                Once upon a time, in the days of sundials and pendulum clocks, people needed a way to agree on the time. For instance, if my watch says 11:13 and your watch says 1:32, who&amp;rsquo;s right?
One way to coordinate time in a city or a sea port was a time ball placed somewhere highly visible. People could use the ball to set their pocket watches, and use their pocket watches to set their other clocks.

Several people have asked me that question, and my answer always surprises them.
&amp;ldquo;In the military,&amp;rdquo; I say, &amp;ldquo;every individual has a lot more latitude and authority to act. In the business world, no one can do anything without explicit instructions.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Really? I thought it would be the other way around,&amp;rdquo; they say.

The difference between 1988 and 2015 is not that I&amp;rsquo;m particularly smarter now, but that I&amp;rsquo;m used to being wrong. Somewhere along life&amp;rsquo;s journey, I realized two things:
*1. Being wrong isn&amp;rsquo;t the end of the world. *2. Being wrong is the beginning of learning.

That simple insight inspired the title of Simon Sinek&amp;rsquo;s latest book, &amp;ldquo;Leaders Eat Last.&amp;rdquo; If I could influence high school or college curricula, no one would graduate without successfully completing a semester course on that principle.
Below is another remarkable video of Simon Sinek discussing how circumstances can override our desire to lead and serve and how leadership and service can fix almost any problem. But first, I&amp;rsquo;d like you think a bit more about these two critical needs: leadership and service.

                We&amp;rsquo;ve reached the end.
On Monday, we corrected disinformation about The Franklin Project.
Next, we looked at the historical conservative framework for national service.
Wednesday was a dissection of The Franklin Project&amp;rsquo;s Plan of Action (as distinguished from the group&amp;rsquo;s vision.)
Yesterday, we examined the consequences of ignoring the call for national service.
Today, we offer an oversimplified proposal for Missouri&amp;rsquo;s version of a national-service program. While inadequate, it is a start.

In part 2, we examined the debate on the right from 1990 with William F. Buckley and Milton Friedman.
Part 3 was a critique of the Franklin Project&amp;rsquo;s Plan of Action.
Today, we will look at the consequences should conservatives turn their backs on the concept of developing a service ethos in America.

                This is part three of a five-part series on national service. Part 1 introduced the controversy and corrected a major misconception. Part 2 looked at national service through the eyes of conservative giants, Milton Friedman, William F. Buckley, and Ronald Reagan.
So, what’s wrong with the Franklin Project? Plenty.
The Franklin Project promotes the idea of a renewed ethos of national service in America. It’s mission:
 The Franklin Project envisions a future in which a year of full-time national service—a service year—is a cultural expectation, a common opportunity, and a civic rite of passage for every young American.

First, answer this for yourself: would you vote for William F. Buckley Jr?
Milton Friedman on National Service My friend Lloyd Sloan points out that Milton Friedman disagreed with Buckley’s call for national service. It seems appropriate, then, to view the idea of a service ethos through the eyes of two champions of conservatism of the 20th century.

The current fiction they advance has to do with an organization called The Franklin Project. The fiction advanced by a few Facebook warriors goes something like this: “The Franklin Project wants mandatory national service.

                Gratitude, like love, is bound only by our choices. The more we give, the more we keep.
I tried to ignore Ferguson today, but I glanced at Twitter hashtag #Ferguson a moment ago. The first tweet I read inspired this post. Someone wrote that &amp;ldquo;being able to be thankful after #Fergson is a privilege itself.&amp;rdquo;
I understand how someone could feel that their &amp;ldquo;gratitude privilege&amp;rdquo; had been revoked. We lost our daughter just before Christmas in 1994, about four weeks after I got out of the Navy.

                I am scaling back my blogging.
I spend about 1-2 hours on most posts. That&amp;rsquo;s writing, researching, photo editing, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s time consuming. It&amp;rsquo;s also worth the effort.
Blogging is an opportunity cost, too. Every hour I spend blogging is an hour I&amp;rsquo;m not doing anything else. The things I&amp;rsquo;m not doing include:
** admiring my wife ** talking to my kids ** catching up with friends ** advancing my career ** cleaning up my office ** changing my underwear ** cheering on the Blues (or Cardinals or Rams) ** working out ** washing my car ** fixing that door that doesn&amp;rsquo;t open right ** training my dogs to make a proper CC and club soda ** paying bills ** answering emails ** blowing the leaves out of the garage ** hunting copperheads and rattlesnakes (we have both out here) ** visiting my parents

Tuesday night at a Tea Party meeting, I managed to destroy a joke of my own, poor making, and insult a friend at the same time. That takes talent. Or . . . something.
So, first, let me apologize to Adam Sharp, the best indy video journalist alive, since he was the victim of my horrible comedic delivery.

I hate to say that. It&amp;rsquo;s embarrassing to admit that I&amp;rsquo;m so jaded as to think &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s all&amp;rdquo; when a young man dies. Sorry. I&amp;rsquo;m just being honest.

Tea Party Patriots picked St. Louis to host the Gateway to November rally under the Arch. Unlike our rag-tag events, this one would be professional all the way: live music with Sounding Fathers, speakers you heard of before the movement began in February 2009, and real security.
The guest speakers began rolling into town on Friday the tenth.

When I write about freedoms lost, I don&amp;rsquo;t itemize the freedoms. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel too bad, though, because almost no one does. Itemizing sucks.
First, it&amp;rsquo;s hard work. &amp;ldquo;Losing freedom,&amp;rdquo; takes about three seconds to type and less time to read.

Every day when I get to work, I go through a thirty-minute routine. I write down the 3 things I want to accomplish that day. I write down my appointments. I write down a one-sentence prayer. I copy a quote to guide me. With the time remaining, I learn one new thing.
Today that one thing I learned was humbling. Shameful, actually.

A young man named Adam Weinstein recently called for incarceration of disbelievers in the cult of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming (CAGW). His argument mirrors the argument Goebbels used in 1930s to quash dissent from eugenics and to take immediate policy actions for the betterment of humanity.

Scientists study all kinds of things. One thing they study is ants, because ants teach a lot about communities.
In a recent study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, ecologists Shigeto Dobata and Kazuki Tsuji studied the effects of &amp;ldquo;cheaters&amp;rdquo; in a colony of Pristomyrmex Punctatus ants.
P. Punctati segment their society into two groups by age. Younger ants tend to hang around the house reproducing asexually.

First, Rubio’s Cuban, and the GOP wants to court Latinos.
Second, Rubio’s relatively young, and the GOP wants to stop the bleeding when it comes to young voters.
But there’s a fundamental problem with the Republican approach, and it stems from the GOP’s least favorite discipline: behavioral science.

Daniel Kahneman is a psychologist who won a Nobel in economics for Prospect Theory, more commonly called Behavioral Economics.

But the bias might actually keep gasoline consumption high by fooling people with number.

The Republican Primary season was already well underway. Before a single caucus or vote, though, we pretty much knew that Mitt Romney would win the nomination. He had the entire Republican establishment behind him, including true conservatives who wanted a “safe” candidate.
We know how that worked out.

What might have been had a strong conservative emerged in 2011? What if someone without baggage had prepared years in advance for a run against the weakened, staggering Obama?

The Nazis interned Frankl. He spent time in four concentration camps, including Auschwitz and Dachau. For three years, his captors made him dig ditches for railroads and water pipes, and fed him a slice of bread and an ounce or two of soup a day.

                Conservatives take great pride in working, and for good reason. Work gives shape to life. Work is the poles of a tent, the bones of a body, the beams in the ceiling.

But work isn’t why we live. We live to pursue happiness.
For some, the pursuit of happiness involves acquiring property. Land, clothes, cars, plastic surgery. All examples of the pursuit of happiness.
Voting is another pursuit. People vote for minor candidates representing strange parties who have no chance of winning.

Generational historians William Strauss and Neil Howe describe a generation of &amp;ldquo;nomads&amp;rdquo; in their prophetic book The Fourth Turning.
 &amp;ldquo;The 13th Generation (Nomad, born 1961-1981) survived a hurried childhood of divorce, latchkeys, open classrooms, devil-child movies, and a shift from G to R ratings. They came of age curtailing the earlier rise in youth crime and fall in test scores—yet heard themselves denounced as so wild and stupid as to put The Nation at Risk.

In his new best-selling book, Jonah Lehrer discusses the link between depression and creativity:
 This helps explain why Forgas has found that states of sadness— he induces the downcast mood with a film about death and cancer— also correlate with better writing samples; subjects compose sentences that are clearer and more compelling.

Some of the stories involve Bain laying off workers to make companies profitable, then selling them off.
Some of the stories involve Bain and Romney chopping companies to bits and selling off the parts.

Jobs’s life left insanely good lessons. Some lessons instruct us on how to do things. Others warn us of bad things to avoid.
One of the good things Steve Jobs taught us: focus. Maniacal focus on things that mattered, and a pathological aversion to distractions.
One example. When Jobs returned to Apple after 10-year exile, he took stock of all the projects underway.

 THE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.
It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand.

What’s important to me may not be important to you. And what you to read about, I might not care about.
That’s why great books achieve a certain universality. They touch on the essence of life itself, of humanity itself, of existence.

                Dale Carnegie, of course.
Published in 1936, Carnagie’s book, How to Make Friends and Influence People, remains one of the most important works in interpersonal human relations ever written.
I wish I’d been humble enough to read this book when I was younger. Might have saved myself a lot of trouble, reputation, and embarrassment.
Here’s an excerpt:
 Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking 1. **The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.

                Look, folks, let’s remember who’s on whose side.
Dana Loesch is a champion of liberty, the conservative grassroots, and everything else we stand for. And she’s a great friend to me, to the Tea Party, and, in a sense, to all of us. She’s elevated this movement locally and nationally like no one else. You wouldn’t be reading this post if not for her.

                In my response to Dan Riehl’s hit piece on Ed Martin, I wrote one more line than I should have. I wrote about an establishment takeover of Big Government.
Mike Flynn, the editor of Big Government, has quietly (and not so quietly) led the fight for liberty and good government for decades. His Big Government site has been a backbone in the resurgence of our first principles.
Much more importantly to me, Mike Flynn is a friend of mine.

                There’s a “special” school in St. Louis County. Its seniors graduated on last Friday.

How sad it must be for those kids. They’re not graduating from the district’s “normal” schools with their peers. For various reasons, they’ve been relegated to a school for misfits.
Seeing the building makes the bad feelings worse. It’s a former grade school, crammed inconveniently behind a bank and a Taco Bell. Its Eisenhower era architecture stands out amidst its Mortgage Boom surroundings like a dandelion on golf course.

On the bright side, you don’t really need friends, do you? You’re a rock star in your own small way. Who made the varsity swim team? You did. Who made honor rolls and deans’ lists? You did. Who landed your job and got the bonus? You did.

                What many people don&amp;rsquo;t get is that cooperation is not the same as consensus.

Cooperation means someone takes the lead on an issue. If it makes sense, and if the leader is perceived to have good character and judgment, others follow. Otherwise, the project is stillborn. It&amp;rsquo;s the way the market picks leaders. Not through org charts, but through action and response.
One person may be the leader on one issue and a cooperator on many others.

The conversation had been on Japan leading up to World War II. The question was important. Why would a nation conquer dissimilar nations? Why accept that burden and risk?
My answer, which I’ve grown more fond of as time’s passed, was something like this: Imperial people view everything as a fixed pie.

But here are three scientifically proven steps to being happier. And since happiness causes success in other areas, not the other way around, these could be the most important tasks you perform.

The problem with traffic signals is that they make all of the problems they’re designed to solve worse. By “all the problems” I mean: * Pollution * Congestion * Deaths * Accidents * Speed of Transit * Risk to pedestrians (except those with certain disabilities)
Banning red light cameras is a great first step, but the ultimate goal should be elimination of traffic lights altogether.

We are concerned that Senator McCaskill put her re-election before Missouri jobs by lobbying the DNC to hold its 2012 convention in Charlotte, NC, instead of St. Louis, MO.

I thought that most people who voted for larger government, higher taxes, tighter regulation, and limits on speech, religion, and assembly, were misguided.

But don’t expect The 5000 Year Leap to change you. Or history. It won’t.
Now, if 70 percent of the US population read it, it might make a difference. Or maybe not. I tend to doubt it, but that’s fodder for a different post.
When tea partiers read books like Glenn Beck’s Common Sense or The 5000 Year Leap, we’re not broadening ourselves—we’re narrowing ourselves.

                Christmas is the holiday about humility.
The humility of the immortal and all powerful and all knowing stooping to become a mere human being.
The humility of God and king to live among the humblest and poorest&amp;ndash;a carpenter&amp;rsquo;s son.
The humility of belonging to a race so broken that our Creator sent his only Son to redeem us.
For me, the humblest part of this season is what I&amp;rsquo;m doing right now.

                I tried to manually trackback to Seth Godin’s post on TV from this post.
Between WordPress’s false negatives on reporting success of links, my laptop’s touchy touchpad, and Typepad’s weird trackback URL system, I managed to:
a. Link once to the wrong blog post
b. Link twice to the right blog post
I pride myself on being respectful of blogging etiquette. I hate trackback spam. I hate it even more when I’m the one creating it.

                Is it better to give or to receive?
Before you answer, let’s look at some of the science behind giving. Then let’s look a little deeper.
Dr. Barbara Fredrickson studies the psychology of happiness. About a decade ago, Dr. Fredrickson announced a formula for creating an “upward spiral” of happiness. In other words, she identified what it takes to have happiness breed happiness. The formula applies to individuals, families, groups, and even companies.

                Drudge’s headlines about Black Friday 2010 raise disturbing questions about America’s purpose as a nation.

We degrade ourselves for deals on crap some puppet-master tells us we cannot live without. In the name of Christ’s birth, we reveal ourselves with headlines like “Craze shoppers stampede,” “Marine stabbed,” “Shopper arrested after packing gun,” “Mall food court placed on lockdown,” “Shopper arrested…raging,” “Police called after thousands rush,” “Woman busted.”
We rush Toys-R-Us doors&amp;ndash;angry, armed, and belligerent&amp;ndash;because our society is grossly disordered.

                A town in England has reduced traffic congestion, pollution, and accidents. One year after the experiment began, the townspeople gushed over the change in the people and the way they drive. One woman’s commute went from twenty minutes to five.
How did this happen?
The town did the opposite of what had always been done. Instead of adding more traffic lights or signs or spy cameras, they went the other direction.

 It was on the sidewalk on Leonor K. Sullivan Blvd, 27 February 2010. Snow flurries drifted and bounced like little kids playing around at a wedding reception.

I can think of no better way to accomplish both goals than to liberally borrow from Simon Sinek’s fantastic blog post about that speech and the importance of living your “why.”

On the big screen, we see The One, The Despot, Barack “Ass Kicker” Obama.
In the foreground, we see and hear Boy Scouts booing and mocking and jeering.

Part of me wishes the Boy Scouts were more respectful of the President of the United States, no matter who occupies that office. But another part of me believes that Obama is such a disgraceful, un-American anomaly that to disrespect him is to honor the United States.

We survived The Dip (Godin, 2007).
  
Back in April, I sensed a dip in the burgeoning grassroots movement. By June 1, my suspicions were confirmed and I blogged about The Dip.

What Breitbart and Big Government did regarding Ms. Sherrod was identical to what every television news program does every day of the week. They produced a news story based on information reasonably available to them.

On Monday, the NAACP leaked a resolution to the Kansas City Star that stated:

                Sometimes it is personal.

Beginning with a simple blog post in February 2009, the St. Louis Tea Party Coalition has attracted over 40,000 people to dozens of events and online crusades. The vast majority of these folks represent America’s highest ideals in character and citizenship. We are educated, polite, and patriotic. We are stand-up people who fix our own problems and earn our own livings. We are not perfect, of course, but we understand that no one else can live our lives for us.

He mocked at our enemies’ plots to destroy America, pointing out that before him stood “eight hundred and forty-nine reasons why you’ll never succeed.”

If you live in Israel, you are not at peace. You are at war. War against a massive body of people who want to destroy you before they move on to destroy Christendom. If Christendom doesn’t destroy itself first.
So let’s all thank Israel for standing tall on the front lines of this epic battle between good and evil.

 Robustness is when you care more about the few who like your work than the multitude who hates it (artists); fragility is when you care more about the few who hate your work than the multitude who loves it (politicians).
 Dazzling, really. Imagine what we could accomplish by ignoring the haters.

                A friend of mine explained an interesting theory to me the other day.
“The natural tendency of the universe is to level everything,” he said. “This entropic force leads us to just ‘go with the flow.’ But what makes us human—what built civilization and made man noble—was when we finally resisted entropy. When we built a levy to keep our village from flooding, or when we learned to lure and trap, then farm, animals instead of tracking them.

                Seth Godin is one of my favorite writers, thinkers, marketers, and presenters. Everything he writes is worth your time reading. Two of his books stand out for me. One is Tribes, because Tribes describes the whole Tea Party experience perfectly. And he wrote it a year before the Tea Party things started.
Right now, though, my other favorite Godin book serves as a question and a guide for the Tea Party movement.

                I ran to Walgreen’s at lunch. I needed some medication—maybe for a cold? I don’t remember for sure. While I was there, I picked up a Muscle Milk and a protein bar so I wouldn’t have to make another stop. I had only about 20 minutes to complete the circuit before my next meeting.
Returning to work, I hit a traffic jam in an unusual place. The outer road was backed up—something I’d never seen before.

The Dow: The Dow trades within a range of 1,000 points with a daily average closing of 8,500.
Grade: D. The average would be a pain to figure out, but it looks like it was closer 9800.
GDP and Economy: By July, everyone pretty much calls the situation &amp;ldquo;Great Depression II.

                I can’t tell you the date of our last sandlot football game. We didn’t commemorate it or mark with a special ceremony. We probably didn’t even know it would be our last game together.

After school, the kids would come to my house. Our next door neighbors, the Nahers, had a double lot, and Mrs. Naher was a former professional women’s baseball player. She loved sports and kids and let us tear up the the lawn they manicured all summer by playing sandlot football in the fall and winter.

                Unbelievable! Scientists have discovered that the huge, glowing fireball in the sky may affect Earth’s temperature.
The latest evidence comes from . . . the Moon.
Back when we used to send astronauts to the Moon, we placed some temperature sensors on the Moon’s surface. We still monitor those sensors.
Guess what they show. Yep, you’re right! As temperatures rose on Earth, temperatures rose on the Moon.

Watts Up With That has all the details.

This eighteen minute presentation synthesizes almost everything I believe about leadership and inspiration.
We own Why
We believe that God&amp;rsquo;s law trumps Man&amp;rsquo;s, and that the Constitution trumps Congress. And the President. And the courts. We believe that each one of us has the will and the capacity to dream our own dreams, live our own lives, and die our own noble deaths without government assistance or government contraints.

                I had a small revelation yesterday: there are two paths to focus.
One path requires constant vigilance against distraction. This path also demands great awareness of many things, knowledge, and outlandish tenacity. This is the path we recognize as heroic.
The other path gets less notice, less acclaim. Those how follow this other path to focus don’t seem to try hard. These are the “naturals.” Things seem to come easy for them.

                Happiness is a choice; anger is a tactic.
Anger will have to wait for a future post. This one is about happiness. So let me ask: would you do something that took less than a minute if that something would make you happier?
Martin Seligman at University of Pennsylvania’s school of Positive Psychology has broken down happiness in more scientifically measurable components:
* Positive Emotion** Engagement** Purpose  Other research has shown how to increase your happiness score.

He is doing well. He survived the first week. He’s been declared fit for full duty. He’s learned to fold things very compactly, to recite the General Orders to the Sentry on command, and to identify his Chain of Command through the President of the United States.
If boot camp hasn’t changed, week two is worse that week one, but I didn’t tell him that.

                The first time I met George W. Bush in person, I was campaigning for Jack Kemp for President. Kemp was running against Vice President George H. W. Bush (and 47 others) for the Republican nomination. This was 1987.
A wonderful, tough, and tireless local Republican organizer named Thelma Stuart recruited me and served as my mentor in Dixiecrat-style politics of South Carolina. My first gig was manning the Kemp booth at the Low Country Stump Days in Charleston.

                Feeling confident, relaxed, and complete is a dream. Many people believe it&amp;rsquo;s an impossible dream. I&amp;rsquo;m learning otherwise.
I&amp;rsquo;m into my third month of acquiring positive habits with Leo Babauta&amp;rsquo;sZen to Done method. At the same time, I&amp;rsquo;m working the 30 day challenge. What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far is that I hold onto too much.
 * I carried around anger and frustration over missed goals and failed or abandoned projects * I vilified good people (in my mind) because I wanted to get my way all the time about everything * I sabotaged myself by trying to do everything anyone asked of me * I was afraid to look weak, and that fear weakened me  The faultering economy, no doubt, led me toZen Habits, which led me to Zen to Done, which led me to &amp;ldquo;The Power of Less,&amp;rdquo; which led me to theSedona Method, which led me here.

                Sometimes decades start early; sometimes they start late.
The 1960s started with JFK&amp;rsquo;s assassination&amp;ndash;until then, they were a lot like the 50s except with a young president whose economic policies were to the right of his Republican predecessor&amp;rsquo;s.
The 1970s culturally started with Woodstock in 1969. As Hunter S. Thompson pointed out in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Woodstock was not a celebration but a funeral. It marked the end of the hopeful part of whatever the 60s were and the beginning of the malaise of the 1970s.

                Several weeks ago, I posted about Leo Babauta&amp;rsquo;s Zen to Done method for Getting Things Done. I apologize for not keeping up my blogging on my progress. But one habit at a time. Habit One: Capturing Everything
More than a month later, I can proudly say I&amp;rsquo;ve mastered the first step in the program. I still record everything on Jott, either on the web or by voice messaging Jott.

                I just finished “The Power of Less” and its companion ebook, “Thriving on Less.” I hope everyone–and I mean everyone–reads these books before the end of January.

Why are these books so important? Because life changed in 2008. The commitments we’d made as individuals, families, communities, nations, and the world received a margin call. We had biggest margin call in history, and everyone from plumbers to Harvard MBAs (especially the MBAs) lacked the capital to pay the bill.

                After a 2 year hiatus from annual predictions, here&amp;rsquo;s what I see happening in the precarious Year of our Lord Two-thousand nine:
The Dow: The Dow trades within a range of 1,000 points with a daily average closing of 8,500.
GDP and Economy: By July, everyone pretty much calls the situation &amp;ldquo;Great Depression II.&amp;rdquo; Unemployment, which declines in the first quarter, increases to more than 12 percent by fall. Gross Domestic Product by quarter:

                Rarely does a single factor cause a paradigm shift. For one example, look at the election of Ronald Reagan. Sure, Reagan had a great message,   expert delivery, and that presidential look. But without Carter&amp;rsquo;s bungling incompetence, excesses by liberals in Congress, a runaway Supreme Court, Soviet expansion, stagflation, the Iranian hostage crisis, and seventeen thousand other annoying problems, Reagan would not have upset an incumbent president in 1980.

We can find two good results of the terrorist siege of Mumbai, India.
First, Rabbi Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg&amp;rsquo;s baby son, Moshe, escaped alive. Good people have set up a fund for the child where you can contribute. Please do so. The child&amp;rsquo;s survival seems to destine him for greatness, as the story contains odd parallels to the story of Moses.
Second, the tragic events forced organizers to cancel Live Earth India, a pagan celebration to spread the lie of Anthropogenic Global Warming.

I hope the West takes a lesson from NSG&amp;rsquo;s fierce, straight-on attack on the terrorists.

                In Zen to Done (ZTD), Leo Babauta recommends working on one positive new habit at a time. He further recommends adopting the habits in the order presented in the book and warns that the temptation is to follow the advice of most similar systems and attempt a dozen new habits all at once.
Since I have none of the positive habits recommended in ZTD or in David Allen&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Getting Things Done,&amp;rdquo; which I&amp;rsquo;ve been re-implementing for nearly a decade, I decided to follow Babauta&amp;rsquo;s advice to the letter, with on exception: I use a digital notebook.

I like tiny phones that do a lot. The Neonode N2 from Neonode is the coolest phone I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.   Totally touchscreen (no buttons)
  Tiny (smaller than a credit card)
  Holds up to 32GB music, videos, photos
  2 Megapixel camera
  Great sound quality

In a typical St. Louis County strip-mall bar during a Friday happy hour about 70 percent of the male patrons would sit behind an Anheuser-Busch product&amp;ndash;Budweiser, Bud Select, Bud Light, Michelob Ultra, even Busch.
Not anymore.
I stopped drinking Select as soon as the announcement of the buyout came last Sunday. But I was shocked last night when I walked into The Corner Pub &amp;amp; Grill in West St.

                It took the nanny-staters to more than a minute to scream at low-carb dieters like me about the Mediterranean Diet study released today.
The study shows that Atkins-like, low-carbohydrate diets are the most effective kind for both weight loss and good health. That joys me, because the only way I can lose and keep of weight is with low carbs. Even when I was running half marathons, I was well over 200 lbs on a 6-1 frame.

Is Wayans really trying to send an anti-abortion message here? Or is this just sophomoric, exploitative garbage masquerading as faux social criticism?
I&amp;rsquo;m a hyperbolist, myself, so I tend to see this as sophomoric anti-abortion speech. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s exploitive: it exploits those who treat infanticide as a coin-flip decision. It exploits the moronic pro-abortion arguments the dehumanize unborn children.

                People love Billy Bob Thornton . . . or they hate him. Either way, they owe themselves a listen to selections from his new band&amp;rsquo;s new album.
The Boxmasters combine the English Invasion with 60s hillbilly music to form &amp;ldquo;electric hillbilly.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s heavy on steel guitar, which gives all their songs the twang that screams &amp;ldquo;old country.&amp;rdquo; I love the sound.

I was never a huge Oprah Winfrey fan, but learning that she chooses an anti-American racist as her minister poisoned whatever good feelings I might have had for her.
Differences between races because of cultural histories are certain. Oprah and Obama, though, demonstrate, in their allegiance to Reverend Wright, a moral corruption that cannot be papered over with soothing rhetoric or million dollar giveaways.

                When I revived this blog some months ago, I decided to set Chesterton as my ambition.� Not to rival him, of course.� But to embody his jovial, lively spirit.� To write from his point of view.�
Go back to 1993, when I wrote _The Conservative Manifesto:_� my goal was to carry on in the tradition of William F. Buckley Jr.� After the book, I wrote for the fledgeling Town Hall Forum on CompuServe three times a week from August 1993 to about July 1995.

                It took me just a second
to stop and watch them play.
My coffee cup felt grown up
when the ball bounced toward my feet.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to smile at them.
My eyes did, though. And big
Then I carried on inside.
They won&amp;rsquo;t be there when I go out.
They&amp;rsquo;re like my coffee cup.

                St. Louis &amp;ndash; When someone says &amp;ldquo;the President,&amp;rdquo; I still think the reference is to Ronald Reagan. As JFK did for Bill Clinton and his generation, and as FDR did for my mom and dad, Ronald Reagan defined the presidency for me. He was my president. He is my hero.
Having just moved to St. Louis from Groton, Connecticut (fleeing taxes, among other reasons), I was busy this afternoon moving furniture from our bedroom to the basement of our house, which is just four years younger than our 40th president.
