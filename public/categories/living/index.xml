      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to pare back our addiction to social media, and I will propose an alternative later in this post.
Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are the primary causes of unhappiness, anger, tribalism, and violence in America and many other countries. Text messaging apps are accessories.
Heavy Facebook Users Are Miserable and Lonely Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport available on Amazon.
  Replicated research shows that the top 1/4 of Facebook users are three times as angry and depressed as the bottom 1/4.</description>

      <description>Do you consider yourself a &amp;ldquo;compassionate&amp;rdquo; person?
You have probably heard that St. Louis City and County issued a new mask mandate on July 1. What do you think about that?
Will the number of new cases decline or continue to rise?
Will this mask mandate shorten the duration of the pandemic or prolong the suffering?
What do logic and science tell us?
Totals Are Meaningless Because The Number of New Cases Can Only Go Up When was the last time you heard of someone dying in a chariot crash?</description>

      <title>Moderna&#39;s COVID Vaccine Announcement Was Likely a Stock Manipulation Scheme</title>

      <description>Just days after I reported that an effective COVID-19 vaccine is highly unlikely, the pharmaceutical company Moderna issued a press release touting promising results from early human trials. People assumed I was wrong.
But I&amp;rsquo;m doubling down. Moderna&amp;rsquo;s vaccine trials have probably already failed, and Moderna&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;encouraging&amp;rdquo; press release proves it.
Coronavirus Vaccines Are Unlikely From The Humane Approach to Coronavirus Is to Open Up Everything published May 16:
 There Probably Won&amp;rsquo;t Be a Coronavirus Vaccine: Since early March, researchers around the world have been warning us that a vaccine for Coronavirus is highly unlikely for a straightforward reason: they have been searching for vaccines against Coronaviruses for decades and have never produced one.</description>

      <title>There Are No Experts: Food, Riots, and Coronavirus</title>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s post was supposed to be about the public health crisis caused by the Coronavirus quarantine, but something more urgent came up.
The Dunning-Kruger effect is a fascinating cognitive bias that causes enormous human suffering. We see it in the prolonged over-reaction to Coronavirus and the riots following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
The experts include politicians, police, and community activists (peaceful). Non-experts include anarchists and rioters, on the one side, and anti-riot militias, on the other.</description>

      <description>The CDC, today, issued guidelines for reopening offices that ignore medical guidance regarding masks.
The latest medical guidance, according to May 21 article in the New England Journal of Medicine reported here, says:
 Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).</description>
