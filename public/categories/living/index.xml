      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s post was supposed to be about the public health crisis caused by the Coronavirus quarantine, but something more urgent came up.
The Dunning-Kruger effect is a fascinating cognitive bias that causes enormous human suffering. We see it in the prolonged over-reaction to Coronavirus and the riots following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
The experts include politicians, police, and community activists (peaceful). Non-experts include anarchists and rioters, on the one side, and anti-riot militias, on the other.</description>

      <description>The CDC, today, issued guidelines for reopening offices that ignore medical guidance regarding masks.
The latest medical guidance, according to May 21 article in the New England Journal of Medicine reported here, says:
 Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).</description>

      <description>In the past week, Dr. Anthony Fauci and the New England Journal of Medicine have admitted that masks are little more than symbols. Virtue signaling.
For those of you who shout &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo; like it&amp;rsquo;s a Tourette tick, this is from the New England Journal of Medicine on May 21, 2020:
 We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).</description>

      <description>File this one under &amp;ldquo;As If We Don&amp;rsquo;t Have Enough to Worry About.&amp;rdquo;
We could be entering an age of revolution around the world, and I blame the sun.
Solar Maxima/Solar Minima The sun goes through ~11 year cycles of high activity (solar maxima with lots of solar flares and sunspots) and low activity (solar minima with few solar flares and sunspots). NASA projected April 2020 (+/- 6 months) as the trough of the current cycle, number 24.</description>

      <title>Should I Wear a Mask</title>

      <description>Go ahead and wear a mask, especially if a merchant requires you to, or if not wearing a mask will cause someone undue anxiety. It&amp;rsquo;s charitable.
Also, if you&amp;rsquo;re highly active (get out a lot), you should probably wear a mask and wash your hands if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be around people who are more likely to suffer severely from Coronavirus: the elderly, the obese, people with chronic conditions.
