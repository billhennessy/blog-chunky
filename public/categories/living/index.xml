      <title>Doomsday Doctors Make the Best Case for Opening the Economy</title>

      <description>A lot of doctors seem to derive much pleasure from convincing people that Coronavirus will kill us all very soon. Very soon. These are the Doomsday Doctors. And if they&amp;rsquo;re right, we need to eliminate all behavior restrictions immediately and enjoy our final days.
The latest tactic of the Doomsday Doctors is to report (non-peer reviewed) that the Coronavirus has mutated into a weapons-grade killer that no one can avoid or resist.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing &amp;ldquo;around&amp;rdquo; this topic for weeks, now. But I have to post this today, because Scott Adams scooped me. Tonight on his Coffee with Scott Adams Periscope he exposed the secret I&amp;rsquo;ve been leading up to. No reason to be subtle any longer. So, here we go.
Watch Scott Adams&amp;rsquo; rant. (Begins about 9:30 mark.)
There will be extra cussing tonight. Put the kids to bed. Close your windows and get under the covers.</description>

      <title>Science Is Wrong Two-Thirds of the Time</title>

      <description>If you believe science, then you disbelieve 2/3 of science.
In 2017, the BBC reported on a major problem in science in medicine: two-thirds (67%) of all scientific and medical studies cannot be replicated. Via BBC:
 Science is facing a &amp;ldquo;reproducibility crisis&amp;rdquo; where more than two-thirds of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist&amp;rsquo;s experiments, research suggests.
 Two years earlier, in 2015, a major study found the same problem, with nearly the same numbers, involving psychology.</description>

      <title>Open Offices Covid Casualty</title>

      <description>Coronavirus could wipe out the open office floor plan as quickly and decisively as it wiped out many corporate bottom lines.
Companies that move to an open office cite two benefits for the design:
  Cost savings by cramming more people into a given amount of space.
  Increased innovation, driven by collaboration.
  But multiple studies show that both assumptions are wrong. Now, Coronavirus has proven that open offices represent a significant public health threat, as well.</description>

      <title>Sunlight Kills Coronavirus</title>

      <description>An expert is someone who can&amp;rsquo;t be fired for being wrong about everything 100 percent of the time.
You can call that Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s Law, and Coronavirus is proving this law iron clad. Iron clad.
The latest confirmation of Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s Law just completed.
In March, Donald Trump and others said that warm weather would diminish the spread of Coronavirus, just as it diminishes the flu. The reason: virus that survive well in cool, dry conditions don&amp;rsquo;t do well in warm, humid conditions.</description>

      <title>Have I Mentioned &#39;Fourth Turning?&#39;</title>

      <description>About three days ago, as the news spread of our world rapidly grinding to a halt, I sent a text to some friends:
 For you Fourth Turning fans, the Climax is right on time.
 If you&amp;rsquo;ve never read my Fourth Turning posts, now might be a good time to do so. I&amp;rsquo;ll wait right here. (Link to Fourth Turning Posts)
Here are some important quotes about the Climax.</description>

      <title>Like It or Not, Herd Immunity Is Probably Our Only Hope to Stave Off Economy Depression</title>

      <description>I know President Trump mocks the idea of herd immunity, but there&amp;rsquo;s really no other option absent a vaccine. And if we keep in lockdown until a vaccine is widely available, millions will die from the collapsed economy and collapsed infrastructure.
What makes Coronavirus more dangerous than flu is lack of immune people.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say that both kill about .01 to .02 percent of everyone who catches them, just for argument&amp;rsquo;s sake.</description>

      <title>Why Are Media Leading Us Into Despair?</title>

      <guid>https://hennessysview.com/post/2020/why-are-media-leading-us-into-despair/</guid>
      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all been seeing the woeful headlines from the media that hates Trump and hates America: CNN, NYTimes, Washington Post, Drudge Report, etc. The headlines combine and conspire to send a single, unmistakable message: DESPAIR.
The headlines and stories are clearly intended to make people panic. The media want people to stay locked in their homes, and they want people to demand that government keeps the brave locked in their homes, as well.</description>

      <title>UPDATE: COVID-19 Acceleration Tracker</title>
      <link>https://hennessysview.com/post/2020/covid-19-acceleration-tracker/</link>

      <guid>https://hennessysview.com/post/2020/covid-19-acceleration-tracker/</guid>
      <description>This is a live view of the most important COVID-19 metric: acceleration rates of positive tests, hospitalizations, and deaths.
Source: The Covid Tracking Project
Key Insight: For every week, Hospitalization rate decreases by about 9.19%.
From My Original Tweet The most important number regarding Coronavirus is a number none of the tracking sites or governments will tell you: acceleration. Lower acceleration of hospitalization and deaths is good. It means the number of new incidents yesterday was smaller than the new incidents from the day before.</description>

      <title>This Is How Masks Will Change People</title>

      <description>Wearing masks in public will change the way people behave, and the consequences for society could be devastating.
The White House released the plan to Open America Again. It&amp;rsquo;s reasonable, 3-phase plan that relaxes Coronavirus restrictions in 14-day increments. As a state achieves certain metrics, based on CDC surveillance data, it advances to the next phase.
Phases one and two allow increased activity with the recommendation of requiring face masks when in confined public places like work.</description>

      <description>America will reopen for business much, much faster than most people think.
This is only a possible scenario, but it&amp;rsquo;s the scenario I see as likeliest case. But I&amp;rsquo;m realistic enough to know I could be terribly wrong. Be careful about acting on anything you read here.
Some of my friends, relying on the horribly flawed data models that the CDC and many states relied on, seem to believe the economy will be locked down most of the summer.</description>

      <description>If a picture can paint 1,000 words, this infographic would fill a library.
It is a visual representation of the death toll from various plagues throughout history (most of which originated in China), including COVID-19 (which originated in China).
You will notice that COVID-19 is a rather mundane specimen. As of April 10, its death toll fell somewhere between the Yellow Fever of the late 1800s and Ebola of 2014-2015.</description>

      <title>Is America Approaching Herd Immunity? **CONFIRMED** </title>

      <description>Models failed. Miserably.
The IHME models the CDC used as their primary source to justify the destruction of President Trump&amp;rsquo;s beautiful economy turned out to be no better than guesses from three drunks at a bar. The IHME factored in strict mitigation (lockdown), but they still over estimated everything by factors as high as 40.
That models were unbelievably bad is not open to debate. The models were hideously bad.</description>

      <title>Why the Acting Secretary of the Navy Should Be Fired</title>

      <description>Last week, Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly fired the commanding officer of the USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT. I wrote about it here. I supported that decision, but today I am asking President Trump to fire Thomas Modly.
Modley fired Captain Brett Crozier after Crozier&amp;rsquo;s letter to a wide distribution list appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle. That five-page letter asked the Navy to move 4,000 sailors from the USS Roosevelt to hotels in Guam to be isolated to protect them from Coronavirus, which was spreading on board the aircraft carrier.</description>

      <description>Last week I hoped that the Coronavirus pandemic would kill a few horrible ideas. One of those bad ideas involves bowing down before data models as if they were some sort of pagan god. (I should have added to that list the idea of foundations funded by American billionaires.)
Data models are not science, but most people have no idea what science is, so they fall prey to this insidious myth.</description>

      <description>I wish I had never read the book Naked Lunch. Once in a while, though, having read it comes in handy.
A Gateway Pundit story about Dr. Anthony Fauci reminded me of something from Naked Lunch.
Dr. Benway is the chief antagonist of that wretched book. He is a sadist who advises governments on ways to keep populations compliant and submissive through fear. For example, from Naked Lunch by William S.</description>

      <description>In the 2003 movie, &amp;ldquo;Northfork,&amp;rdquo; two pseudo-government agents working for a power company try to convince a devout Mormon farmer to get out of his home before the construction of a dam floods him out.
The farmer insists he must first receive a sign from God. The Mormon has built a replica of Noah&amp;rsquo;s ark, which he expects will rise with the waters and sail him and has wives to safety.</description>

      <description>People like clean storylines with an obvious, likable hero and a sinister, hateable villain.
When real life tells us a story, our minds will mold the facts to fit our desired storylines. In other words, we will create a hero and a villain for every story, even if there aren&amp;rsquo;t any.
As we retell our semi-fictionalized story to ourselves or others, we pad the hero&amp;rsquo;s character and tarnish the villain&amp;rsquo;s with each telling.</description>

      <description>Someone sent me a video. The video shows a doctor explaining how coronavirus is worse than the flu. Should we believe him?
I say, no. And the reasons we should not believe this doctor about the relative dangers of two diseases have nothing to do with medicine. They have everything to do with statistics and lying.
First, the statistics.
The Doctor&amp;rsquo;s Statistical Error The doctor, a general surgeon, opens the video by stating his conclusion that coronavirus is deadlier than influenza and his proof.</description>

      <description>SEATTLE â Left-wing terrorist group Antifa has threatened to sue non-members wearing protective masks in public as a violation of the group&amp;rsquo;s trademark.
&amp;ldquo;Wearing masks in public as a form of intimidation and anonymity is our thing,&amp;rdquo; said Seattle-area organizer Josh Millgram. &amp;ldquo;These fascists are ruining the brand. I mean, look, with everybody out there wearing some sort of mask, we don&amp;rsquo;t even know who to hit.&amp;rdquo;
Antifa Seattle&amp;rsquo;s general counsel and chief operating officer, Heidi Berkhardt, wrote in a statement, &amp;ldquo;by long use and general practice, the Antifa mask has become a trademark for the organization.</description>

      <description>Last week, I pointed out that the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus is a meaningless number. The media is all atwitter about it, but the media are mostly idiots. (Never trust a reporter.)
Bloomberg now cites many &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo; who agree with me on this:
 It doesnât matter that the United States surpassed China this week in reported Covid-19 cases because those numbers (83,507 and 81,782 respectively as of March 26) donât tell us how many people actually became infected in either country.</description>

      <title>7 Bad Ideas That Coronavirus Might Finally Kill</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a silver lining in the coronavirus pandemic, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to look far. Several bad ideas have become institutionalized in America in recent decades. These bad ideas have served the virus well, made it more deadly, and forced us to shut down our economy.
No more!
If we learn anything from this pandemic, these bad ideas will die:

      <title>Number of Confirmed Cases Doesn&#39;t MatterâHere&#39;s What Does</title>

      <guid>https://hennessysview.com/post/2020/number-of-infections-doesnt-matterheres-what-does/</guid>
      <description>Hysterical headlines scream about the number of new coronavirus infections every hour. This is a mistake. Ignore those headlines. Number of confirmed cases will rise as number of people tested rises. If we tested everyone for the flu, the number of confirmed flu cases would be astronomical.
Doing some casual analysis, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious what drives the death rate: the number of hospitalizations in a given geographic area.
Last week I pointed out that mean averages are meaningless, even destructive if used to project into the future.</description>

      <description>Newspapers are lying to you. They&amp;rsquo;re feeding you ads pretending it&amp;rsquo;s news.
The headlines are not only false, they&amp;rsquo;re dangerous. And wrong.
The most common such lie goes like this: &amp;ldquo;Best Streaming Service For Shelter in Place&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s What to Binge Watch While Locked Down&amp;rdquo;
Here&amp;rsquo;s the truth: we will not emerge from the coronavirus crisis stronger or better if we spend this time doing what we&amp;rsquo;ve always done.</description>

      <description>When you hear &amp;ldquo;coronavirus&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;COVID-19,&amp;rdquo; you probably think of words like fear, disruption, recession, sick, death, inconvenient, and maybe even China.
What if every time you hear &amp;ldquo;coronavirus,&amp;rdquo; you automatically think &amp;ldquo;gratitude?&amp;rdquo;
How do you feel when you feel grateful?
Most people associate feeling grateful with relief, appreciation, happiness, joy, and safety. Good feelings.
Now, why are you grateful for coronavirus?
That&amp;rsquo;s completely up to you. But I bet you can list just two reasons for being grateful for coronavirus.</description>

      <description>You might have heard mention of the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918 to 1919. Being the great-grandson of a doctor who came out of retirement to assist with St. Louis&amp;rsquo;s response to that epidemic, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d should share a little information about the differences and similarities between the Spanish Flu and coronavirus. I&amp;rsquo;ll briefly cover both the diseases and the responses.
 Note: The word &amp;ldquo;pandemic&amp;rdquo; was unknown in 1918, so contemporaneous references to the disease used the term &amp;ldquo;epidemic.</description>

      <description>Horses are prey to many species. Their behavior, their physiology, is that of a beast under constant threat from, usually, smaller, less beautiful organisms.
Yet, wild horses capture our imaginations. Their grace and beauty, their power, and their gentleness reminds us of what we would be if we lived into our highest ideals for ourselves. We would be worthy of our sufferings.
Your routine has been obliterated. Nothing you did routinely two weeks ago will be done for at least a month.</description>

      <title>Should We Overreact?</title>

      <description>Several friends tell me we are overreacting to the Coronavirus pandemic. Others say we are too complacent. So, which is it?
When dealing with an epidemic, we need to consider two things:
 Current numbers are not very useful. Effects are non-linear.  Beware Current Numbers The first argument I hear from those who wish we&amp;rsquo;d just go on with life as usual involves current statistics: number of confirmed cases, number of dead, etc.</description>

      <description>Americans, in a crisis, want something to do. Maybe this is something. A mission.
Senator Martha McSally told Judge Jeanine tonight that the next problem to solve in the coronavirus testing problem is the first mile. We have plenty of labs ready to accept specimens, but getting the specimens from the drive-thru test centers to a drop-off point, say a post office or Fedex drop.
Perhaps people could be enlisted to serve as couriers of these specimens.</description>

      <description>My wife texted me yesterday asking if we should stock up a couple of weeks worth of food and water.
Now, there&amp;rsquo;s really no empirical reason to stock up on food and water. But there is a psychological/economic reason: the Common Knowledge game.
Common Knowledge is something everyone knows everyone knows. When something becomes Common Knowledge, most people will behave as if the &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; were true, if it is not. Stock markets are perfect example of Common Knowledge games.</description>

      <description>Long ago in South St. Louis Mom and Dad would go to an early Mass on Sundays. Maybe 6:30, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. Anyway, it was early. They&amp;rsquo;d bring home donuts from Donut Drive-In on Chippewa.
But between the time they left for Mass and the time they returned with donuts, us kids would get into mischief. As I remember it, my oldest sister, Tee, started it.
Tee would come downstairs, go straight to the ice box, open the freezer, pull out the newish carton of Neapolitan ice cream (&amp;ldquo;newish&amp;rdquo; because Mom and Dad shopped on Thursdays), and stand over the sink eating it with a big spoon straight from the carton.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to write a book called How to Lose Friends and Alienate People. But nobody reads autobiographies anymore. So I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you how to be unpopular, instead.
Being unpopular is pretty easy. And it&amp;rsquo;s hard, too. It&amp;rsquo;s easy because there&amp;rsquo;s only one rule, which we&amp;rsquo;ll get to in a moment. It&amp;rsquo;s hard for two reasons: beforehand, it&amp;rsquo;s scary to think about following the rule. Afterwards, it&amp;rsquo;s lonely and painful to have followed the rule.</description>

A: &amp;ldquo;I told you I was sick!&amp;rdquo;
 I happened to see a Facebook post from the George Gilder today. The post announced why Gilder is coming out of retirement at age 79.
(I rarely look at Facebook, but there&amp;rsquo;s flooding in my town today. Facebook is the best source for reports from the ground.)
I followed George Gilder closely for many years back in the mid-1990s.</description>

I spent all day moving my blog from a self-hosted Wordpress site to a Hugo static site. Since I no longer support advertising, I don&amp;rsquo;t need all the weight of Wordpress. Plus, managing a blog through Github is actually easier for me. I use git professionally. And I pretty much think in Markdown at this point.
The final reason for the move is the change in direction for this blog.</description>

      <description>Lots, actually.Â But one Stoic practice that&amp;rsquo;s central to Christianity seems pertinent on All Hallow&amp;rsquo;s Eve: memento mori.
Remember your death.Â Remember, you will die.Â We all die.Â All the tech billionaires spending their fortunes trying to live forever will die.Â No matter how young and healthy you are, time is running through your hourglass. It will run out. And you probably won&amp;rsquo;t know when.Â For over a year I&amp;rsquo;ve carried a challenge coin that reminds me of my death:</description>

I should have paid more attention to Scott Adams in those days. Scott used pure statistical reasoning to conclude that the packages probably came from a crazy Trump supporter: base cases. There are more crazy people than there are brilliant criminal strategists who hate Trump.</description>

All these mail bombs I&amp;rsquo;m talking about.Â You have to ask yourself: &amp;ldquo;who would do this two weeks before an election?&amp;rdquo;
If you&amp;rsquo;re a conservative, do you do something that&amp;rsquo;s bound to inspire sympathy for lefties right before an election? No.
Unless you&amp;rsquo;re insane.Â Any sane person would know that a (failed) mail-bomb plot targeting a bunch of Democrats and leftists will only make conservatives look bad.</description>

      <description>You probably heard that a bunch of witches are gathering in New York City today to put hexes on Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump, and others. Don&amp;rsquo;t take this lightly.Â Father Richard Heilman and folks at the Holy League have asked Christians to pray the Lorica of St. Patrick for Justice Kavanaugh, substituting &amp;ldquo;Brett Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Justice Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; for the first person pronouns.
This is a powerful prayer that&amp;rsquo;s more than 1,500 years old!</description>

      <description>No, it&amp;rsquo;s not more money. Nor better ads. Nor snarkier tweets. Nor more Facebook friends.Â Keeping the US House of Representatives out of the hands of the #AngryDemocratMob requires supernatural help. We cannot do it alone.
The other side has supernatural help. The other side cooperates with Satan for power on earth. Therefore, our battle is not with mere mortals alone, but with demons working in concert with men. Even if we were to assemble a vast army of mere mortals, we will lose.</description>

A 54-day novena for our nation. It ends on October 7 with the Rosary Coast-to-Coast. Which means it started before I learned of either.Â But that&amp;rsquo;s okay.

      <description>One man can confirm or deny the central allegation against Pope Francis. The Catholic Church needs that man to step up now.
In an 11-page letter by former US Nuncio (ambassador) Archbishop Carlo Maria ViganÃ², Pope Francis is accused of ignoring warnings about Cardinal Timothy McCarrick. ViganÃ² claims he personally delivered the warning to Pope Francis in 2013. The pope allegedly ignored the warning and the dossier on McCarrick in 2013.</description>

 Pope Francis ignored evidence of crimes and overturned punishment imposed by Pope Benedict on the wicked and disgraced Cardinal McCarrick. That&amp;rsquo;s according to a former papal nuncio and corroborated by a former first counselor to the nunciature to the United States speaking on the record. The two men have direct knowledge of the matter.
Pope Francis refused to comment on the allegations that he personally covered up McCarrick&amp;rsquo;s crimes.</description>

      <description>Why do you stay a Catholic?
Today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel reading comes from John 6. John chapter 6 is all about the bread of life. In it, Jesus shocks his Jewish followers by announcing that they must eat his flesh and drink his blood to achieve eternal life.
When some of his disciples challenged this formula for immortality, Jesus doubled down, saying:
 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</description>

Archbishop Robert Carlson of St. Louis asked Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Attorney General, Josh Hawley, to review all of the archdiocese&amp;rsquo;s records regarding abuse cases. Hawley agreed to the Archbishop&amp;rsquo;s request.
Archbishop Carlson deserves our praise and respect for his openness and honesty.</description>

      <description>Because of my sinfulness and selfishness, I was out of communion with the blessed sacrament for most of my adult life. To anyone who&amp;rsquo;s never been excommunicated, you cannot imagine the pain and humiliation of being in that state.
Being a coward, I avoided mass. I was too embarrassed. Week after week, my neighbors would see me not going to communion. I&amp;rsquo;d have to get up and let the communicants through, then kneel back down, often alone.</description>

      <description>Last week, Pope Francis approved a change to the Catechism of the Catholic Church.
Longtime readers might recall that my views on the death penalty are a bit nuanced. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t always have the courage to express it.
In 2014, I wrote:
 I donât buy the idea that the death penalty is no deterrent. I donât buy the notionÂ that the death penalty should be banned. I think the availabilityÂ of such a punishment serves its purpose.</description>

Neither did I. But when I heard this on EWTN Radio the other day, I remembered there are two translations of the Beatitudes. One version goes with &amp;ldquo;Blessed are . . .&amp;rdquo; and the other with &amp;ldquo;Happy are . . . .&amp;rdquo; So, I guess it&amp;rsquo;s true. The words are interchangeable.
Happiness, then, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean walking around in some lithium-induced state of bliss.</description>

      <description>I love listening to Gregorian Chant.
It&amp;rsquo;s all beautiful. But one chant, for me, stands above the rest. I think you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy it, so I&amp;rsquo;m embedding it right here.
[audio m4a=&amp;quot;https://www.hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/18-veni-creator-spiritus-.m4a&amp;rdquo;][/audio]
Veni Creator Spiritus byÂ Schola Sancte Scholasticae and St. Cecilia&amp;rsquo;s Abbey, UK
I hope you enjoy this lovely, calming music as much as I do. If you like it, please leave a note in the comments. Maybe even bookmark this page to listen again and again.</description>

      <description>Many years ago, a company hired a new president.
After several months on the job, this new president learned that most of his employees couldn&amp;rsquo;t pick him out of a line-up. He spent so much time in his office or in meetings or traveling that he rarely met with the people who reported to him.
To fix this problem, he set up a series of lunches. They were off-site at restaurants around town.</description>

      <description>Some people complain about politicians not representing their constituents well.Â I disagree.Â From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my life, all politicians do a great job of representing their constituents. They really do.
If I&amp;rsquo;m right about politicians being 100% true to their constituents, then why are so many voters so unhappy with the people they voted for?Â It&amp;rsquo;s simple: the voters aren&amp;rsquo;t every politician&amp;rsquo;s constituents.Â That&amp;rsquo;s right. Not all politicians consider the people who vote for them constituents.</description>

      <description>The American Revolution started in a tavern.
Actually, it started in many taverns. But taverns they were.
J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis hatched their greatest novels in The Eagle and Child tavern in Oxford.
If you want to be as great as the founding fathers or as prolific as Tolkien and Lewis, get off social media and get to a bar. I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you why.
#1: Social Media Breed Depression and Anxiety The more time you spend on Facebook, the more likely you are to suffer depression, attempt suicide, and feel overwhelmed by life.</description>

      <description>For 99.875% of modern human existence, women tended the village and the home while men did dangerous things for long periods of time. And for the past 50 years, our academics and planners have pretended the entire history of our species didn&amp;rsquo;t matter.
The academics and planners are killing us.Â I just looked at a list of 286 quotes about fathers. It is a modern list. For every positive quote about fathers, the list contains eight negative quotes.</description>

      <description>My mom and dad have two anniversaries. One anniversary celebrates the day my uncle Bob drove them to Hot Springs, Arkansas to elope. The other celebrates the day about a week later when, having learned of their civil nuptials, my grandfather ordered them to go see Father English and set themselves right with the church.
Like father, like son, I guess. Except, the kid&amp;rsquo;s a lot slower. Fifteen years slower.</description>

      <description>I gave up news for Lent.Â Â I also stayed away from blogging. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to have fewer opinions about fewer things. When you have a lot of opinions about a lot of things, nothing is more important than anything else. But that&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous. Some things are more important than others. Some questions must be answered before others.Â Â So I gave up news for Lent, and I might never go back.</description>

[socialpoll id=&amp;quot;2479812&amp;rdquo;]
Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve answered, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the limits of data science in 2018.
The best data scientists in the world agreed with nearly absolute certainty. These scientists determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hillary Clinton would be the 45th President of the United States. That was in 2016.
Those scientists were wrong.</description>

      <description>People want cover.Â Danger drives us together.
It&amp;rsquo;s our nature. Our herding response gave our species an advantage. The herders lived to breed. The wanderers, the stragglers, fell prey. Genes of herders increased. Genes of loners receded.
But our strongest cover is our parents. They&amp;rsquo;re the protection we seek.
The pair of humans who brought us into the world provide the best cover. We are born helpless. Our parents sustain us.</description>

      <description>Do you follow the recommended diets? Low fat. High carbohydrate? Eat lots of fruit?
If so, you&amp;rsquo;re probably overweight. And your blood tests are probably a mess. Maybe your doctor recommends expensive prescriptions to lower your cholesterol.
A new study finds the problem is not your fault. Your doctor, poorly educated in nutrition, and government recommendations, prompted by industry lobbyists, are designed to keep you fat and sick. And it&amp;rsquo;s not just US government.</description>

      <description>The Easiest Formula for Mastering Persuasion, Losing Weight, and Avoiding Disease (video) &amp;ldquo;Persuasion&amp;rdquo; is part of my job title. When you&amp;rsquo;re a persuasion professional, you get a lot of questions about persuasion. Some are sincere. Others are skeptical, like, &amp;ldquo;Okay, persuasion boy, persuade me to give you a hundred dollars.&amp;rdquo;
Persuasion doesn&amp;rsquo;t work like that. But it also does. Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: if you ask me to persuade you to give me a hundred bucks, you already want to give me a hundred bucks.</description>

      <description>You hear people say &amp;ldquo;follow your passion.&amp;rdquo; It sounds nice.
Then you hear wildly successful people say &amp;ldquo;do NOT follow your passion.&amp;rdquo; Mark Cuban is in this camp. So is Dilbert creator Scott Adams.
So which is it? Do you follow your passion or not?
My answer might disappoint you. Because it&amp;rsquo;ll sound evasive. But I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a shot. I&amp;rsquo;ll need you to help out here, though. Think of this as an exercise.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I established an end: great health care that ordinary people can afford.
You remember I talked about John Braddock&amp;rsquo;s explanation of strategy: choose the end and work backward. Then forword.
And Braddock&amp;rsquo;s first step after choosing an end: what comes immediately before. That&amp;rsquo;s where we are today.
A few weeks back, I wrote several posts about diet (here and here). I warned you that the government and doctors and, especially, dieticians have been poising us for years.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re sick and fat, it might not be your fault. You listen to your doctor. You follow government diet guidelines. You eat more fresh fruit and vegetables. You cut down on animal fat. You eat more grains.
And you just get sicker and fatter.
You&amp;rsquo;re told it&amp;rsquo;s your fault. But it&amp;rsquo;s probably not.
You might be a good mom or dad who wants your kids to learn healthy eating habits.</description>

You&amp;rsquo;ve been told to eat poison your whole life, by people who are supposed to know better. Here&amp;rsquo;s some truth to set you free.
Actually, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why. But it&amp;rsquo;s happening to you and millions of other people. Doctors are killing their patients. And they&amp;rsquo;re getting a lot of help from the government and big agriculture.</description>

I was always good at this when I was young, but I&amp;rsquo;m not that young anymore. I&amp;rsquo;m 53, but I held my breath for two minutes and 47 seconds last Thursday. And I could have gone longer, but I was bored.</description>

You might find yourself rolling your eyes and thinking youâre too old and too smart for magic letters, but the more you read, the more you might wish this letter really is magic.
If youâre still reading, you might even laugh a little at how stupid this sounds.</description>

Do you ever get the feeling we&amp;rsquo;re getting exactly what we deserve?

      <description>When the BBC called Brexit for LEAVE at about 12:30 a.m. CDT today, I thought first of my friend Mike Flynn. Mike had a keen sense of history. He put the Tea Party movement into proper perspective, as he did with all events.Â Mike kept us from overstating both the Tea Party&amp;rsquo;s effect and its potential. Or he put them in context and reminded us that our potential depends on ourselves, not outside forces.</description>

You would think that a jihadist attack on a gay nightclub would trigger an anti-terror backlash against Islamic terrorists, would you not?
Anti-Gay Jihad Instead, America&amp;rsquo;s radical left has declared a jihad against gays. Leading this jihad is Imam Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook.</description>

      <description>The god of Memorial Day is Janus, looking to the future as well as the past.
Memorial Day looks back, but it also warns of something coming. The list of war dead is incomplete. It always will be.
Each generation looks at its wars and finds something final, but the end never comes. Memorials never end while man roams the earth.
When I see the Vietnam Memorial, with its rows and ranks of lost warriors, I see, too, the invisible ledger that stretches to the horizon.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s regress in time to the 1980s.
Remember C. Everett Koop, the Surgeon-General who launched the Safe Sex movement? Koop wanted to curtail the spread of AIDS.Â The Safe Sex movement started slowly and originally focused on non-monogamous gay men. By 1987, though, everyone was doing it. (Or not doing &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; as the case may be.) A February 17, 1987 New York Times headline declared &amp;ldquo;Safe Sex Movement Gains Favor Among Heterosexuals.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note because I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the road all week.
Fight to Evolve: The Government&amp;rsquo;s Secret War on NTX just hit Number 2 in Censorship category on the Amazon Kindle store. (These numbers change a lot, so I&amp;rsquo;m posting this screenshot to prove it.)

      <description>I was a pretender.
In 2012, I pretended I believed Mitt Romney would win. But I knew better. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the heart to tell the truth to the volunteers banging doors and working call lists from our election office in South County.
But I knew Romney would lose. I suspected the GOP would not regain the Senate.
When some of our hardest workers showed up to help break down the office and move our belongings, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t look at them.</description>

      <description>I re-read Ronald Reagan&amp;rsquo;s announcement speech the other day.
Delivered November 13, 1979, these are the words that launched the greatest presidency of my lifetime.
Notice the natural humanity in Reagan&amp;rsquo;s words. He didn&amp;rsquo;t browbeat people with abstract concepts like the Constitution or liberty. Instead, he spoke about the real lives of ordinary Americans. And the everyday life of an America that lived up to its ideal. And notice the complete lack of pomposity, vanity, and vulgarity so prevalent in the frontrunners of 2016.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, in the days of sundials and pendulum clocks, people needed a way toÂ agree on the time. For instance, if my watch says 11:13 and your watch says 1:32, who&amp;rsquo;s right?
One way to coordinate time in a city or a sea port was a time ball placed somewhere highly visible. People could use the ball to set their pocket watches, and use their pocket watches to set their other clocks.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What was the biggest adjustment for you going from the military to the business world?&amp;rdquo;
Several people have asked me that question, and my answer always surprises them.
&amp;ldquo;In the military,&amp;rdquo; I say, &amp;ldquo;every individual has a lot moreÂ latitude and authority to act. In the business world, no one can do anything without explicit instructions.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Really? I thought it would be the other way around,&amp;rdquo; they say.
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s the popular culture, but the truth is one-hundred eighty degrees the other way.</description>

      <description>I am wrong a lot.
When I was 25, I was wrong a lot, too.
The difference between 1988 and 2015 is not that I&amp;rsquo;m particularly smarter now, but that I&amp;rsquo;m used to being wrong. Somewhere along life&amp;rsquo;s journey, I realized two things:
*1. Being wrong isn&amp;rsquo;t the end of the world. *2. Being wrong is the beginning of learning.
When I was 25, I refused to admit being wrong about anything.</description>

      <description>The next US President must be a great communicator.
Distilling complex and controversial problems into mental models accessible to large numbers of people is not deception&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s brilliance. The reason we hang onto sound bites isn&amp;rsquo;t because we&amp;rsquo;re stupid&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s because we&amp;rsquo;re busy. We all don&amp;rsquo;t have time to earn masters-degree understanding of every issue facing society and government. Honest, accurate distillations of the complex ideas allow us to choose and act quickly.</description>

      <description>Marine Corps officers eat last.
That simple insight inspired the title of Simon Sinek&amp;rsquo;s latest book, &amp;ldquo;Leaders Eat Last.&amp;rdquo; If I could influence high school or college curricula, no one would graduate without successfully completing a semester course on that principle.
Below is another remarkable video of Simon Sinek discussing how circumstances can override our desire to lead and serve and how leadership and service can fix almost any problem. But first, I&amp;rsquo;d like you think a bit more about these two critical needs: leadership and service.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time I didn&amp;rsquo;t like Joe LeGrand.
It was 3rd grade. I was in the Epiphany Toppers Drum and Bugle Corps, and Joe was a bugler who stood right in front of me. He kept turning around and giving me dirty looks. So I decided right then and there that I didn&amp;rsquo;t like him.
Joe was a year ahead of me in school. While our lives intersected a lot, we weren&amp;rsquo;t really close.</description>

Be warned: I did not edit the posts, so the ebook contains all the links to previous posts in the series. If there&amp;rsquo;s interest, I&amp;rsquo;ll go back and clean it up. This is just for convenience.

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve reached the end.
On Monday, we corrected disinformation about The Franklin Project.
Next, we looked at the historical conservative framework for national service.
Wednesday was a dissection of The Franklin Project&amp;rsquo;s Plan of Action (as distinguished from the group&amp;rsquo;s vision.)
Yesterday, we examined the consequences of ignoring the call for national service.
Today, we offer an oversimplified proposal for Missouri&amp;rsquo;s version of a national-service program. While inadequate, it is a start.</description>

      <description>In part 1 of this series, we clarified some misconceptions and falsehoods about the Franklin Project.
In part 2, we examined the debate on the right from 1990 with William F. Buckley and Milton Friedman.
Part 3 was a critique of the Franklin Project&amp;rsquo;s Plan of Action.
Today, we will look at the consequences should conservatives turn their backs on the concept of developing a service ethos in America.

      <description>This is part three of a five-part series on national service. Part 1 introduced the controversy and corrected a major misconception. Part 2 looked at national service through the eyes of conservative giants, Milton Friedman, William F. Buckley, and Ronald Reagan.
So, whatâs wrong with the Franklin Project? Plenty.
The Franklin Project promotes the idea of a renewed ethos of national service in America. Itâs mission:
 The Franklin Project envisions a future in which a year of full-time national serviceâa service yearâis a cultural expectation, a common opportunity, and a civic rite of passage for every young American.</description>

      <description>This is part 2 of a series on national service and the Franklin Project. Read part 1 here.
First, answer this for yourself: would you vote for William F. Buckley Jr?
Milton Friedman on National Service My friend Lloyd Sloan points out that Milton Friedman disagreed with Buckleyâs call for national service. It seems appropriate, then, to view the idea of a service ethos through the eyes of two champions of conservatism of the 20th century.</description>

      <description>You know how to tell when a political camp has nothing on an opponent?
It begins making stuff up.
That âmaking stuff upâ has become the chief form of amusement among those who oppose Eric Greitens for Governor.
The current fiction they advance has to do with an organization called The Franklin Project. The fiction advanced by a few Facebook warriors goes something like this: âThe Franklin Project wants mandatory national service.</description>

      <description>Limited government, fiscal responsibility, and the other tea party principles are not ends. They were never ends. Tea party principles are merely the most effective and efficient means to nobler ends
Those ends include a society and a nation that respects and protects life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Without life, of what use are the others?
Just as we speak out when &amp;ldquo;government becomes destructive of these ends,&amp;rdquo; so we must speak out when misguided and deranged individuals pervert those principlesâor any principlesâto their own illegitimate and murderous ends.</description>

      <description>I usually breeze through books.
I read Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman in four days. And it has math.
I read Eric Greitens&amp;rsquo;s book The Heart and the Fist in two days.
Why did it take me over a month to finish Resilience?
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure, but here&amp;rsquo;s what I think.
First, the book compels action. How could I read this paragraph without writing a blog post?
  If we are trapped in a life where everything is provided for us, our minds fail to grow, our relationships atrophy, and our spirits deteriorate.</description>

      <description>Harsh, I know.
The St. Louis Blues disappeared from the NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs in a 4-2, first-round collapse for the third consecutive season.
And this year was supposed to be different. So different. With off-season pickups like Jori Lehtera and Paul Stastny, we expected St. Louis to shut down for a parade in June, not in the 3rd period of game six.
Instead, we&amp;rsquo;re wondering how soon will T.J. Oshie sweaters go on the clearance rack at Dick&amp;rsquo;s?</description>

      <description>I hear that Jamie Allman ripped into Senator John Danforth yesterday.
Allman called Danforth a failure and a thug. According to Allman, Danforth&amp;rsquo;s sin was defending a friend against lies, defending a people against centuries-old hate.
I guess Jamie Allman and his handlers like lies and hate.
I&amp;rsquo;d hate to be Jamie Allman on judgement day.

*1. Name 3 people you consider wildly successful. *2. For each person you named, what is the number one criterion for establishing his or her success?
Please do that before continuing.
Done?
Okay. Iâm going to guess that, when all the answers are tabulated, wealth and income will be the top criteria for success.</description>

I tried to ignore Ferguson today, but I glanced at Twitter hashtag #Ferguson a moment ago. The first tweet I read inspired this post. Someone wrote that &amp;ldquo;being able to be thankful after #Fergson is a privilege itself.&amp;rdquo;
I understand how someone could feel that their &amp;ldquo;gratitude privilege&amp;rdquo; had been revoked. We lost our daughter just before Christmas in 1994, about four weeks after I got out of the Navy.</description>

      <description>I am scaling back myÂ blogging.
I spend about 1-2 hours on most posts. That&amp;rsquo;s writing, researching, photo editing, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s time consuming. It&amp;rsquo;s also worth the effort.
Blogging is an opportunity cost, too. Every hour I spend blogging is an hour I&amp;rsquo;m not doing anything else. The things I&amp;rsquo;m not doing include:
** admiring my wife ** talking to my kids ** catching up with friends ** advancing my career ** cleaning up my office ** changing my underwear ** cheering on the Blues (or Cardinals or Rams) ** working out ** washing my car ** fixing that door that doesn&amp;rsquo;t open right ** training my dogs toÂ make a proper CC and club soda ** paying bills ** answering emails ** blowing the leaves out of the garage ** hunting copperheads and rattlesnakes (we have both out here) ** visiting my parents</description>

      <description>If you talk long enough, you can butcher the best jokeÂ in the world&amp;ndash;even the one from Monty Python that the Allies used to win WWII.
https://youtu.be/ienp4J3pW7U
Tuesday night at a Tea Party meeting, I managed to destroy a joke of my own, poor making, and insult a friend at the same time. That takes talent. Or . . . something.
So, first, let me apologize to Adam Sharp, the best indy video journalist alive, since he was the victim of my horrible comedic delivery.</description>

      <description>What did you think when you first heard reports of violence in Ferguson? I mean, after the shooting death of Michael Brown?
Did you ever for a moment think, &amp;ldquo;this is about more than just Michael Brown?&amp;rdquo;
I hate to say that. It&amp;rsquo;s embarrassing to admit that I&amp;rsquo;m so jaded as to think &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s all&amp;rdquo; when a young man dies. Sorry. I&amp;rsquo;m just being honest.
I understand community grief and anger.</description>

      <description>It was 2010. St. Louis was the epicenter of the Tea Party movement.
Tea Party Patriots picked St. Louis to host the Gateway to November rally under the Arch. Unlike our rag-tag events, this one would be professional all the way: live music with Sounding Fathers, speakers you heard ofÂ before the movement began in February 2009, and real security.
The guest speakers began rolling into town on Friday the tenth.</description>

      <description>I confess.
When I write about freedoms lost, I don&amp;rsquo;t itemize the freedoms. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel too bad, though, because almost no one does. Itemizing sucks.
First, it&amp;rsquo;s hard work. &amp;ldquo;Losing freedom,&amp;rdquo; takes about three seconds to type and less time to read. Listing freedoms,on the other hand, takes that much time just to highlight all the freedoms and click the un-ordered list button. God forbid I find myself working in straight HTML and have to hand-typeÂ &amp;quot;</description>

My nephewÂ scored two tickets to Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.I texted my son, Patrick, to see if he was home. I planned to fly home, put on my Blues sweater, grab Patrick, and fly down to the Scot.
But Patrick didn&amp;rsquo;t need a ride or a ticket. He was already on his way to the game with a friend.</description>

Every day when I get to work, I go through a thirty-minute routine. I write down the 3 things I want to accomplish that day. I write down my appointments. I write down a one-sentence prayer. I copy a quote to guide me. With the time remaining, I learn one new thing.
Today that one thing I learned was humbling. Shameful, actually.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.&amp;rdquo;
 &amp;ndash;President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Farewell Address, 1961
A young man named Adam Weinstein recently called for incarceration of disbelievers in the cult of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming (CAGW). His argument mirrors the argument Goebbels used in 1930s to quash dissent from eugenics and to take immediate policy actions for the betterment of humanity.</description>

      <description>Before I answer that, a little science.
Scientists study all kinds of things. One thing they study is ants, because ants teach a lot about communities.
In a recent study published inÂ Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, ecologistsÂ ShigetoÂ Dobata and Kazuki Tsuji studied the effects of &amp;ldquo;cheaters&amp;rdquo; in a colony ofÂ Pristomyrmex Punctatus ants.
P.Â PunctatiÂ segment their society into two groups by age. Younger ants tend to hang around the house reproducing asexually.</description>

WWII Veterans asked the White House for permission to visit the World War II Memorial in case of a shutdown. The veterans are part of the Honor Flights program that helps aging veterans visit the WWII Memorial.
Even though there&amp;rsquo;s no cost involved, the White House chose to dishonor the veterans&amp;rsquo; request. It send forth &amp;ldquo;goons,&amp;rdquo; in Senator Paul&amp;rsquo;s works, to erect barricades around the memorial.</description>

And these hills have eyes.
You slowly look around the desert and white shards of light catch your eye. Reflections of the sun off lenses of cameras mounted on poles about every every 30 degrees around the perimeter of the field.</description>

      <description>Marco Rubio gave the Republican response to the State of the Union address for two reasons.
First, Rubioâs Cuban, and the GOP wants to court Latinos.
Second, Rubioâs relatively young, and the GOP wants to stop the bleeding when it comes to young voters.
But thereâs a fundamental problem with the Republican approach, and it stems from the GOPâs least favorite discipline: behavioral science.
Young People Are Naturally Skeptical You hear about scams that target older folks all the time.</description>

      <description>Often, the best outcome seems less satisfying than alternatives.

Daniel Kahneman is a psychologist who won a Nobel in economics for Prospect Theory, more commonly called Behavioral Economics. In his book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman describes a cognitive bias that leads people to make the wrong choice on automobiles. But the bias might actually keep gasoline consumption high by fooling people with number.
Say youâre concerned with the amount of gasoline you use.</description>

The Republican Primary season was already well underway. Before a single caucus or vote, though, we pretty much knew that Mitt Romney would win the nomination. He had the entire Republican establishment behind him, including true conservatives who wanted a âsafeâ candidate.
We know how that worked out.

What might have been had a strong conservative emerged in 2011? What if someone without baggage had prepared years in advance for a run against the weakened, staggering Obama?</description>

The Nazis interned Frankl. He spent time in four concentration camps, including Auschwitz and Dachau. For three years, his captors made him dig ditches for railroads and water pipes, and fed him a slice of bread and an ounce or two of soup a day.</description>

      <description>Conservatives take great pride in working, and for good reason. Work gives shape to life. Work is the poles of a tent, the bones of a body, the beams in the ceiling.

But work isnât why we live. We live to pursue happiness.
For some, the pursuit of happiness involves acquiring property. Land, clothes, cars, plastic surgery. All examples of the pursuit of happiness.
Voting is another pursuit. People vote for minor candidates representing strange parties who have no chance of winning.</description>

Italy sentenced six scientists to prison for the felony of failing to predict an earthquake.

Jack Hennessy answered the call of World War II. He was a Machinistâs Mate in the Navy. He answered, again, when North Korea crossed the 34th Parallel.</description>

To what and whom do we owe loyalty, and how should we express it?
Generational historians William Strauss and Neil Howe describe a generation of &amp;ldquo;nomads&amp;rdquo; in their prophetic book The Fourth Turning.
 &amp;ldquo;The 13th Generation (Nomad, born 1961-1981) survived a hurried childhood of divorce, latchkeys, open classrooms, devil-child movies, and a shift from G to R ratings. They came of age curtailing the earlier rise in youth crime and fall in test scoresâyet heard themselves denounced as so wild and stupid as to put The Nation at Risk.</description>

In his new best-selling book, Jonah Lehrer discusses the link between depression and creativity:
 This helps explain why Forgas has found that states of sadnessâ he induces the downcast mood with a film about death and cancerâ also correlate with better writing samples; subjects compose sentences that are clearer and more compelling.</description>

Some of the stories involve Bain laying off workers to make companies profitable, then selling them off.
Some of the stories involve Bain and Romney chopping companies to bits and selling off the parts.

      <description>Last night, someone asked me, âwhoâs the most influential person in your iPhone contacts?â
âI donât know,â I said. âBreitbartâs dead.â
David Carr writes in New York Times about the Life and Death of Andrew Breitbart.
Be advised that neither Carr nor NYT shares our political beliefs. And the tactics they cheer from the left, they attack when from the right. Funny how whenKaren Finney lies about Mitt Romney, it&amp;rsquo;s good journalism.</description>

      <title>RIP, Andrew Breitbart **UPDATE**</title>

      <description>Business Insider has picked up a Big Journalism story that Andrew Breitbart died last night.Â (Big Journalism is one of Breitbartâs web sites.)
If this is true, then weâve lost a gallant warrior in the battle to preserve and advance freedom and liberty.
Of course, the lefties will flood the internet with hate and bile.Â So maybe the obit is a plot to draw the lefties out and reveal them for who and what they really are.</description>

      <description>Looks different, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?
After hosting my own web sites forever, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to simplify my server admin life. I&amp;rsquo;m moving Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View to another service from my own servers.
The difference you should see is the theme. (I&amp;rsquo;m tired of the minimalism.) Also, some archives from before 2010 might be missing for a while. They&amp;rsquo;ll catch up soon enough.
Thanks
UPDATE In addition to the changes above, a couple of comments posted during the upgrade have been lost.</description>

      <description>Iâm almost finished reading Walter Isaacsonâs biography of Apple co-founder and genius Steve Jobs.
Jobsâs life left insanely good lessons. Some lessons instruct us on how to do things. Others warn us of bad things to avoid.
One of the good things Steve Jobs taught us:Â focus.Â Maniacal focus on things that mattered, and a pathological aversion to distractions.
One example.Â When Jobs returned to Apple after 10-year exile, he took stock of all the projects underway.</description>

      <description>Scroogeâs nephew left the office and let in two men in the process. They came to ask for a donation for Londonâs poor.
 &amp;ldquo;At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,&amp;rdquo; said the gentleman, taking up a pen, &amp;ldquo;it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.</description>

      <description>We know how the story ends.
 &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s to-day!&amp;rdquo; cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.
&amp;ldquo;EH?&amp;rdquo; returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s to-day, my fine fellow?&amp;rdquo; said Scrooge.
&amp;ldquo;To-day!&amp;rdquo; replied the boy. &amp;ldquo;Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Christmas Day!&amp;rdquo; said Scrooge to himself. &amp;ldquo;I haven&amp;rsquo;t missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night.</description>

      <description>In the course of our lives, we sometimes lose our way. We wander off the good path. Or we fail to blaze the trail we should.

 THE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.
It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand.</description>

      <description>When I was a kid, I loved Christmas on Sundays. What I hated were the years before and after the Sunday Christmas.

My problem was I didnât want to go to Mass two days in a row.
To give some background, I grew up in a Catholic home. Very Catholic. My dad went to Epiphany. My momâs Catholic, and her dad converted very late in life. Two of my dadâs cousins were Monsignors.</description>

      <description>Have you ever thought, âI need to do more for others?â
I have. And Iâve made feeble attempts to satisfy that urge. Feeble.
Still, when Iâve done something âgoodâ for others with no expectation of return, I kind of thump my chest and smile at myself in the mirror like Iâm some kind of big shot.
Then my wife introduced me to Valerie Hays, and I realized how much more a person can do.</description>

      <description>The Washington Postâs headline writer made a common mistake on Sunday.

He confused âone who apologizesâ with âapologist.â
An easy mistake, no doubt, for most of us. Professional headline writers should know better. So should Glenn Kessler, the author of the WP story.
 The claim that Obama is an apologist for the nation began to take shape shortly after he became president.
 An apologist is âone who speaks or writes in defense of someone or something.</description>

      <description>Some center-right people take their ball and go home. Guess who?

Since the 2010 election, weâve heard from the Establishment (GOP, MSM, DNC) that Tea Partiers are too puritanical.
The elitist theory holds that Tea Partiers demand doctrinaire allegiance to some engraved-granite list of principles. Stray from that list, and the Tea Party will hunt you down like a dog in the street and beat you with a Wiffle Ball bat until you pee blood for a week.</description>

      <description>Writers are always looking for the perfect topic for a book. But thereâs a problem.
Whatâs important to me may not be important to you. And what you to read about, I might not care about.
Thatâs why great books achieve a certain universality. They touch on the essence of life itself, of humanity itself, of existence.
Some say that the secret to perfectly spellbinding stories is a mixture of just three elements: sex, food, and spirit.</description>

      <description>Dale Carnegie, of course.
Published in 1936, Carnagieâs book, How to Make Friends and Influence People, remains one of the most important works in interpersonal human relations ever written.
I wish Iâd been humble enough to read this book when I was younger. Might have saved myself a lot of trouble, reputation, and embarrassment.

      <description>Look, folks, letâs remember whoâs on whose side.
Dana Loesch is a champion of liberty, the conservative grassroots, and everything else we stand for. And sheâs a great friend to me, to the Tea Party, and, in a sense, to all of us. Sheâs elevated this movement locally and nationally like no one else. You wouldnât be reading this post if not for her.

      <description>In my response to Dan Riehlâs hit piece on Ed Martin, I wrote one more line than I should have. I wrote about an establishment takeover of Big Government.
Mike Flynn, the editor of Big Government, has quietly (and not so quietly) led the fight for liberty and good government for decades. His Big Government site has been a backbone in the resurgence of our first principles.
Much more importantly to me, Mike Flynn is a friend of mine.</description>

      <description>Thereâs a âspecialâ school in St. Louis County. Its seniors graduated on last Friday.

How sad it must be for those kids. Theyâre not graduating from the districtâs ânormalâ schools with their peers. For various reasons, theyâve been relegated to a school for misfits.
Seeing the building makes the bad feelings worse. Itâs a former grade school, crammed inconveniently behind a bank and a Taco Bell. Its Eisenhower era architecture stands out amidst its Mortgage Boom surroundings like a dandelion on golf course.</description>

      <description>What many people don&amp;rsquo;t get is that cooperation is not the same as consensus.

Cooperation means someone takes the lead on an issue. If it makes sense, and if the leader is perceived to have good character and judgment, others follow. Otherwise, the project is stillborn. It&amp;rsquo;s the way the market picks leaders. Not through org charts, but through action and response.
One person may be the leader on one issue and a cooperator on many others.</description>

The conversation had been on Japan leading up to World War II. The question was important. Why would a nation conquer dissimilar nations? Why accept that burden and risk?
My answer, which Iâve grown more fond of as timeâs passed, was something like this: Imperial people view everything as a fixed pie.</description>

      <description>Some of the biggest potholes on the road to happiness come from bad advice from self-help âexperts.â
But here are three scientifically proven steps to being happier. And since happiness causes success in other areas, not the other way around, these could be the most important tasks you perform.

      <description>Iâve written about this before.
The problem with traffic signals is that they make all of the problems theyâre designed to solve worse. By âall the problemsâ I mean: * Pollution * Congestion * Deaths * Accidents * Speed of Transit * Risk to pedestrians (except those with certain disabilities)
Banning red light cameras is a great first step, but the ultimate goal should be elimination of traffic lights altogether.</description>

      <description>Iâm torn.
Yesterday, I took part in a demonstration outside Senator Claire McCaskillâs St. Louis office on Delmar. The future of the republic is important. We are concerned that Senator McCaskill put her re-election before Missouri jobs by lobbying the DNC to hold its 2012 convention in Charlotte, NC, instead of St. Louis, MO.
Down the road, a group of Cardinals fans held a demonstration outside Busch Stadium. The future of future Hall of Famer Albert Pujols is important, too.</description>

      <description>Conservatism and the Tea Party movement are good for America and good for the world. Moreover, our beliefs, our theory of government, and our principles are good for people. All people. Everywhere.

That said, our marketing to date has been spotty at best and atrocious at worst. We donât sell ourselves well.
By âmarketing,â I donât mean phoniness or deception. Rather, we must advance those ideas that will do the greatest good or avert the gravest harm.</description>

      <description>**Obama Productions Inc. ** Garish chic. No other way to describe it.
Where were the Greek columns?Â No official sponsors?Â Why not GM and Goldman Sachs?
While Obamaâs speech was appropriate and well deliveredâhis best since taking officeâthe crass and tasteless setting, the shouting and cheering, the lack of dignity and solemnity, will mark this event as an embarrassment to the country and an affront to the families and victims. Step one of triangulation is admitting that your base is a bunch of wacked out hatemongers.</description>

      <description>For most of my life I was naÃ¯ve.Â I think.
I thought that most people who voted for larger government, higher taxes, tighter regulation, and limits on speech, religion, and assembly, were misguided.
Iâve always known and acknowledged that the people who advocated and plotted to concentrate power in the hands of a few were wicked creatures.Â I never hesitated to attack them head-on.
But the others.Â The others I sometimes pitied.</description>

      <description>How sad is the story of the Tucson tragedy.
Good people died. Good people grieve.
A little girl, born on 9-11, went on her way to her reward. Too soon. So, so too soon.
Experience says that some survivors will become bitter and angry. Thatâs sad, too.
Some will become depressed.
All will weep.Â Especially the little girlâs daddy.Â (I canât bring myself to write their namesâthat would make it too personal for me.</description>

      <description>This week last year, I read The 5000 Year Leap. Good book. If you havenât read it, do so. You might learn some interesting things.
But donât expect The 5000 Year Leap to change you. Or history. It wonât.
Now, if 70 percent of the US population read it, it might make a difference. Or maybe not. I tend to doubt it, but thatâs fodder for a different post.
When tea partiers read books like Glenn Beckâs Common Sense or The 5000 Year Leap, weâre not broadening ourselvesâweâre narrowing ourselves.</description>

      <description>Yes, I read that. And I saw that. And somebody told me about that, too.
I see the ridiculous charges leveled by ignorant bigots against the Tea Party. I hear the slander on MSNBC and CNN. I know that Ben Jealous and Nancy Pelosi live on lies about you and me the way vampires live on human blood.
I get it.
My immediate urge when I read or hear this nonsense is anger.</description>

      <description>Christmas is the holiday about humility.
The humility of the immortal and all powerful and all knowing stooping to become a mere human being.
The humility of God and king to live among the humblest and poorest&amp;ndash;a carpenter&amp;rsquo;s son.
The humility of belonging to a race so broken that our Creator sent his only Son to redeem us.
For me, the humblest part of this season is what I&amp;rsquo;m doing right now.</description>

Between WordPressâs false negatives on reporting success of links, my laptopâs touchy touchpad, and Typepadâs weird trackback URL system, I managed to:
a. Link once to the wrong blog post
b. Link twice to the right blog post
I pride myself on being respectful of blogging etiquette. I hate trackback spam. I hate it even more when Iâm the one creating it.</description>

      <description>Is it better to give or to receive?
Before you answer, letâs look at some of the science behind giving. Then letâs look a little deeper.
Dr. Barbara Fredrickson studies the psychology of happiness. About a decade ago, Dr. Fredrickson announced a formula for creating an âupward spiralâ of happiness. In other words, she identified what it takes to have happiness breed happiness. The formula applies to individuals, families, groups, and even companies.</description>

We degrade ourselves for deals on crap some puppet-master tells us we cannot live without. In the name of Christâs birth, we reveal ourselves with headlines like âCraze shoppers stampede,â âMarine stabbed,â âShopper arrested after packing gun,â âMall food court placed on lockdown,â âShopper arrestedâ¦raging,â âPolice called after thousands rush,â âWoman busted.â
We rush Toys-R-Us doors&amp;ndash;angry, armed, and belligerent&amp;ndash;because our society is grossly disordered.</description>

      <description>A town in England has reduced traffic congestion, pollution, and accidents. One year after the experiment began, the townspeople gushed over the change in the people and the way they drive. One womanâs commute went from twenty minutes to five.
How did this happen?
The town did the opposite of what had always been done. Instead of adding more traffic lights or signs or spy cameras, they went the other direction.</description>

      <description>It seems impossible that nearly nineteen months have passed since I met Dana Loesch for the first time.
 It was on the sidewalk on Leonor K. Sullivan Blvd, 27 February 2010. Snow flurries drifted and bounced like little kids playing around at a wedding reception. Two-hundred or so people had already arrived, and Dana brought the cutest little megaphone youâve ever seen. With that megaphone, we announced the first St.</description>

I can think of no better way to accomplish both goals than to liberally borrow from Simon Sinekâs fantastic blog post about that speech and the importance of living your âwhy.â

      <description>I guess this is the Boy Scout Jamboree. Itâs too wonderful to research.
On the big screen, we see The One, The Despot, Barack âAss Kickerâ Obama.
In the foreground, we see and hear Boy Scouts booing and mocking and jeering.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAWsy7VV8oE&amp;amp;hl;=en_US&amp;amp;fs;=1&amp;amp;hl;=en]
Part of me wishes the Boy Scouts were more respectful of the President of the United States, no matter who occupies that office. But another part of me believes that Obama is such a disgraceful, un-American anomaly that to disrespect him is to honor the United States.</description>

We survived The Dip (Godin, 2007).

Back in April, I sensed a dip in the burgeoning grassroots movement. By June 1, my suspicions were confirmed and I blogged about The Dip.</description>

      <description>To no oneâs surprise, leftist idiots and hate-mongers like David Frum, Keith Olbermann, and the staff of CNN point their crooked, hostile fingers toward Andrew Breitbart as the cause of Shirley Sherrodâs pain. Thatâs like blaming Ron Howard for the problems on board Apollo 13.
What Breitbart and Big Government did regarding Ms. Sherrod was identical to what every television news program does every day of the week. They produced a news story based on information reasonably available to them.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it is personal.

Beginning with a simple blog post in February 2009, the St. Louis Tea Party Coalition has attracted over 40,000 people to dozens of events and online crusades. The vast majority of these folks represent Americaâs highest ideals in character and citizenship. We are educated, polite, and patriotic. We are stand-up people who fix our own problems and earn our own livings. We are not perfect, of course, but we understand that no one else can live our lives for us.</description>

Major General Stephen Layfield, the reviewing officer at the Navyâs June 11 Boot Camp Graduation, introduced my son, AT Jack Hennessy, and 848 of Jackâs fellow sailors to America&amp;rsquo;s enemies. He mocked at our enemiesâ plots to destroy America, pointing out that before him stood âeight hundred and forty-nine reasons why youâll never succeed.â
The crowd of about 4,000 roared. The sailors, in ranks, could not even clap.</description>

      <description>No, Iâm not a war monger. But peace is not the absence of war. Itâs the presence of peace.

If you live in Israel, you are not at peace. You are at war. War against a massive body of people who want to destroy you before they move on to destroy Christendom. If Christendom doesnât destroy itself first.
So letâs all thank Israel for standing tall on the front lines of this epic battle between good and evil.</description>

 Robustness is when you care more about the few who like your work than the multitude who hates it (artists); fragility is when you care more about the few who hate your work than the multitude who loves it (politicians).
 Dazzling, really.Â Imagine what we could accomplish by ignoring the haters.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine explained an interesting theory to me the other day.
âThe natural tendency of the universe is to level everything,â he said. âThis entropic force leads us to just âgo with the flow.â But what makes us humanâwhat built civilization and made man nobleâwas when we finally resisted entropy. When we built a levy to keep our village from flooding, or when we learned to lure and trap, then farm, animals instead of tracking them.</description>

      <description>Seth Godin is one of my favorite writers, thinkers, marketers, and presenters. Everything he writes is worth your time reading. Two of his books stand out for me. One is Tribes, because Tribes describes the whole Tea Party experience perfectly. And he wrote it a year before the Tea Party things started.
Right now, though, my other favorite Godin book serves as a question and a guide for the Tea Party movement.</description>

      <description>A new poll shows Americanâs are stressed out. Almost half of Americans say theyâre under moderate to severe financial stress.
I feel it, too. Financially, emotionally, and chronologically.
While my book Zen Conservatism wonât fix all your problems, it will help you deal with whatâs going on in America a little better.
From now until Fatherâs Day, Iâm giving you $4.95 off the cover price, so you can get the book for just $10 plus shipping.</description>

      <description>I ran to Walgreenâs at lunch. I needed some medicationâmaybe for a cold? I donât remember for sure.Â While I was there, I picked up a Muscle Milk and a protein bar so I wouldnât have to make another stop.Â I had only about 20 minutes to complete the circuit before my next meeting.
Returning to work, I hit a traffic jam in an unusual place.Â The outer road was backed upâsomething Iâd never seen before.</description>

The Dow:Â The Dow trades within a range of 1,000 points with a daily average closing of 8,500.
Grade:Â D. The average would be a pain to figure out, but it looks like it was closer 9800.
GDP and Economy:Â By July, everyone pretty much calls the situation &amp;ldquo;Great Depression II.</description>

      <description>I canât tell you the date of our last sandlot football game. We didnât commemorate it or mark with a special ceremony. We probably didnât even know it would be our last game together.

After school, the kids would come to my house. Our next door neighbors, the Nahers, had a double lot, and Mrs. Naher was a former professional womenâs baseball player. She loved sports and kids and let us tear up the the lawn they manicured all summer by playing sandlot football in the fall and winter.</description>

      <description>Unbelievable! Scientists have discovered that the huge, glowing fireball in the sky may affect Earthâs temperature.
The latest evidence comes from . . . the Moon.
Back when we used to send astronauts to the Moon, we placed some temperature sensors on the Moonâs surface. We still monitor those sensors.
Guess what they show. Yep, youâre right! As temperatures rose on Earth, temperatures rose on the Moon.

Watts Up With That has all the details.</description>

 The delete-your-Facebook movement â scheduled for May 31 â has yet to attract too many pledges, but with anti-Facebook sentiment on the rise that could change in the near future. In fact, yesterday Danny Sullivan of Search Engine LandÂ noticed that âhow do i delete my facebook accountâ is now one of the topÂ Googlesuggestions when typing âhow do i â¦â in the search box.</description>

This eighteen minute presentation synthesizes almost everything I believe about leadership and inspiration.
We own Why
We believe that God&amp;rsquo;s law trumps Man&amp;rsquo;s, and that the Constitution trumps Congress. And the President. And the courts. We believe that each one of us has the will and the capacity to dream our own dreams, live our own lives, and die our own noble deaths without government assistance or government contraints.</description>

      <description>I had a small revelation yesterday: there are two paths to focus.
One path requires constant vigilance against distraction. This path also demands great awareness of many things, knowledge, and outlandish tenacity. This is the path we recognize as heroic.
The other path gets less notice, less acclaim. Those how follow this other path to focus donât seem to try hard. These are the ânaturals.â Things seem to come easy for them.</description>

No, I donât get 3 cents every time someone registers on ThankfulFor.com. But as a member of several grassroots organizations trying to change America, I want my teammates to be in the best possible spirits.</description>

      <description>Happiness is a choice; anger is a tactic.
Anger will have to wait for a future post. This one is about happiness. So let me ask: would you do something that took less than a minute if that something would make you happier?
Martin Seligman at University of Pennsylvaniaâs school of Positive Psychology has broken down happiness in more scientifically measurable components:
* Positive Emotion** Engagement** Purpose  Other research has shown how to increase your happiness score.</description>

      <description>I heard from my son, Jack, tonight for the first time since he left for Navy boot camp on April 14.
He is doing well. He survived the first week. Heâs been declared fit for full duty. Heâs learned to fold things very compactly, to recite the General Orders to the Sentry on command, and to identify his Chain of Command through the President of the United States.
If boot camp hasnât changed, week two is worse that week one, but I didnât tell him that.</description>

It was probably the last day that he and I will share a mailing address.Â In a few days, Iâll get a postcard containing a new address at RTC Great Lakes. It will be written in his own hand. He will miss home when he writes it.
I hope Iâm not revealing too much.</description>

      <description>Request:Â If you read a blog post on Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View that seems to be rooting for America to fail or suffer in order that Obama take the blame, please e-mail me (bill-at&amp;ndash;hennessysview&amp;ndash;dot&amp;ndash;com) and comment.Â I&amp;rsquo;m a hot-head, and I might not catch myself.
The United States and every country on earth is in a perilous position right now.Â The world economy is on the brink of depression.Â Bad business practices driven by even worse government policies and regulations have destroyed $ trillions in wealth and left us on a narrow, swampy peninsula between deflation and hyperinflation.</description>

      <description>The first time I met George W. Bush in person, I was campaigning for Jack Kemp for President.Â Kemp was running against Vice President George H. W. Bush (and 47 others) for the Republican nomination.Â This was 1987.
A wonderful, tough, and tireless local Republican organizer named Thelma Stuart recruited me and served as my mentor in Dixiecrat-style politics of South Carolina.Â My first gig was manning the Kemp booth at the Low Country Stump Days in Charleston.</description>

      <description>Feeling confident, relaxed, and complete is a dream. Many people believe it&amp;rsquo;s an impossible dream.Â I&amp;rsquo;m learning otherwise.
I&amp;rsquo;m into my third month of acquiring positive habits with Leo Babauta&amp;rsquo;sZen to Done method.Â At the same time, I&amp;rsquo;m working the 30 day challenge.Â What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far is that I hold onto too much.
 * I carried around anger and frustration over missed goals and failed or abandoned projects * I vilified good people (in my mind) because I wanted to get my way all the time about everything * I sabotaged myself by trying to do everything anyone asked of me * I was afraid to look weak, and that fear weakened me  The faultering economy, no doubt, led me toZen Habits, which led me to Zen to Done, which led me to &amp;ldquo;The Power of Less,&amp;rdquo; which led me to theSedona Method, which led me here.</description>

Most years New Years just sort of happens. It arrives. Getting out of 2008 felt like we went for it on 4th and 13 deep inside our own territory. We pulled the goalie and went with a sixth attacker. We sent an injured Albert Pujols to pinch hit for our best reliever. We pulled out all the stops.

      <description>I might have mentioned in an earlier post that I quit smoking about a month ago. I must thank Leo Babauta, his blog ZenHabits.net, and his ebook, Zen to Done, for giving me the motivation and confidence to quit.
I have quit in the past. I went almost 4 years between 1998 and 2002, so I know I can do it for good.
While the money I&amp;rsquo;ve saved on cigarettes I&amp;rsquo;ve plowed back into nicotine lozenges, it&amp;rsquo;s amazing how quickly the savings add up:</description>

 Â Malcolm Gladwell is the best researcher-writer alive today.  I declared the book the most important in a generation. People made fun of me.Â Well, Thomas Sowell comes close to echoing my reaction:
 This book is an outstanding achievement in itself, and its readability, insights, and imagination make it one of the best books of 2008 or any other year.</description>

      <description>Sometimes decades start early; sometimes they start late.
The 1960s started with JFK&amp;rsquo;s assassination&amp;ndash;until then, they were a lot like the 50s except with a young president whose economic policies were to the right of his Republican predecessor&amp;rsquo;s.
The 1970s culturally started with Woodstock in 1969. As Hunter S. Thompson pointed out in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Woodstock was not a celebration but a funeral. It marked the end of the hopeful part of whatever the 60s were and the beginning of the malaise of the 1970s.</description>

      <description>I just finished âThe Power of Lessâ and its companion ebook, âThriving on Less.â I hope everyoneâand I mean everyoneâreads these books before the end of January.
https://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=hennesssview-20&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;p=8&amp;amp;l=as1&amp;amp;asins=1401309704&amp;amp;fc1=000000&amp;amp;IS2=1&amp;amp;lt1=_blank&amp;amp;m=amazon&amp;amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;amp;bc1=000000&amp;amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;f=ifr
Why are these books so important? Because life changed in 2008. The commitments weâd made as individuals, families, communities, nations, and the world received a margin call. We had biggest margin call in history, and everyone from plumbers to Harvard MBAs (especially the MBAs) lacked the capital to pay the bill.</description>

      <description>After a 2 year hiatus from annual predictions, here&amp;rsquo;s what I see happening in the precarious Year of our Lord Two-thousand nine:
The Dow: The Dow trades within a range of 1,000 points with a daily average closing of 8,500.
GDP and Economy: By July, everyone pretty much calls the situation &amp;ldquo;Great Depression II.&amp;rdquo; Unemployment, which declines in the first quarter, increases to more than 12 percent by fall. Gross Domestic Product by quarter:</description>

      <title>Jennifer Aniston Wins at the Box Office</title>

      <description>No, I&amp;rsquo;m not a celebrity freak; I&amp;rsquo;m just a red-blooded American male who thinks Jennifer Aniston is about as gorgeous as a celebrity can be. (She&amp;rsquo;s almost as beautiful as my wife.) I have no idea what she&amp;rsquo;s like in real life. I have no knowledge of her politics. I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether she&amp;rsquo;s fallen for the global warming idiocy. All I know is that she looks and acts (in public) like the sort of girl I&amp;rsquo;d want my sons to marry.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at holiday posts, so I turn to America&amp;rsquo;s greatest Catholic preacher since Fulton Sheen:
The blessed and joyous time of Christmas is here again. So, Iâll just take the opportunity to thank all of our viewing and listening family for allowing us into your homes. I donât take that for granted. I am honestly grateful to you for allowing us to serve you in that way.
As I look out the windows of my home in Montana it sure is âbeginning to look a lot like Christmas.</description>

      <description>Rarely does a single factor cause a paradigm shift. For one example, look at the election of Ronald Reagan. Sure, Reagan had a great message, expert delivery, and that presidential look. But without Carter&amp;rsquo;s bungling incompetence, excesses by liberals in Congress, a runaway Supreme Court, Soviet expansion, stagflation, the Iranian hostage crisis, and seventeen thousand other annoying problems, Reagan would not have upset an incumbent president in 1980.

      <description>Rarely does a book require immediate action from the reader. &amp;ldquo;The Rights of Man&amp;rdquo; by Thomas Paine moved America&amp;rsquo;s founder&amp;rsquo;s to action. &amp;ldquo;The Communist Manifesto&amp;rdquo; moved Vladimir Lenin to enslave a nation&amp;ndash;and allowed Stalin to enslave many more. &amp;ldquo;The Origin of Species&amp;rdquo; launched a crusade against tradition that grows in intensity with each subsequent generation. (Listverse has a list of the 10 most influential books of all time, admittedly subjective.)</description>

      <description>This is not tongue-in-cheek or flippant.
We can find two good results of the terrorist siege of Mumbai, India.
First, Rabbi Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg&amp;rsquo;s baby son, Moshe, escaped alive. Good people have set up a fund for the child where you can contribute. Please do so. The child&amp;rsquo;s survival seems to destine him for greatness, as the story contains odd parallels to the story of Moses.
Second, the tragic events forced organizers to cancel Live Earth India, a pagan celebration to spread the lie of Anthropogenic Global Warming.</description>

      <description>Say you&amp;rsquo;re the CEO of Wal-Mart. You get a report from your store in Valley Stream, NJ, that one of your employees was trampled to death by your customers who broke down the doors to get at your Black Friday specials before anyone else. In the chaos, a customer, 8-months pregnant, suffered a miscarriage.
How would you respond?
Suppose you were the police who responded? How would you handle the situation in which the crowd, gripped by throes of a shopping frenzy refused to allow first responders to attempt to save the man&amp;rsquo;s life?</description>

      <description>Hundreds of people trampled others to death so that they could get to cheap retail goods the fastest &amp;ndash; presumably to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. . . .At some point, that horrible irony should cause people to pause and think about what motivates them in this holiday season.
 Amen to that, Ed. While I have no eagerness to live through an economic Great Depression, I think we need it.</description>

      <description>According to Tweeters in the streets of Mumbai outside Nariman House, the Jewish Center, NSG Commandos (Indian special forces) are high-fiving people in the streets. The crowds are singing patriot songs. No gunfire.
Meanwhile, 30 or more bodies were found in the Oberoi hotel.
I hope the West takes a lesson from NSG&amp;rsquo;s fierce, straight-on attack on the terrorists.
Also, have you noticed that our Western, pro-terrorist media (CNN, NY Times, LA Times, MSNBC) refuse to call the Mumbai terrorists &amp;ldquo;terrorists?</description>

      <description>This morning I felt no compulsion to get back in bad after turning off the alarm at 5:00. I must be getting used to the practice.
I have been about 90 percent on writing down (Jotting) every commitment that comes into my world. Oddly, the ones I&amp;rsquo;m most likely to overlook are the most obvious and visible duties.
Ignoring the Big Rocks
For example, today my boss asked me to kick off a project that I&amp;rsquo;d been asking to do for some time.</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;m Collecting everything (Habit 1) via Jott and working on Early Rising (not a ZTD habit something I need more of), some apprehension preceded the the weekend&amp;rsquo;s arrival. (What&amp;rsquo;s ZTD? Click here to view more details)
Challenges of Weekend ZTD
First, most of my list items focus on work. That meant I&amp;rsquo;d have to shift my list management to look for loose ends from the work week that could be tied up from home and on items to do at home and errands.</description>

      <description>In Zen to Done (ZTD), Leo Babauta recommends working on one positive new habit at a time. He further recommends adopting the habits in the order presented in the book and warns that the temptation is to follow the advice of most similar systems and attempt a dozen new habits all at once.
Since I have none of the positive habits recommended in ZTD or in David Allen&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Getting Things Done,&amp;rdquo; which I&amp;rsquo;ve been re-implementing for nearly a decade, I decided to follow Babauta&amp;rsquo;s advice to the letter, with on exception: I use a digital notebook.</description>

Along the way, I&amp;rsquo;ve bought his ebook, &amp;ldquo;Zen to Done.</description>

      <description>My mother told me to always find the good in a bad situation.
If Obama wins, we&amp;rsquo;ll have 4 years of knee-slapping, chin-rattling, crisis-causing gaffes from the silliest candidate for high office since . . . Quayle?
In today&amp;rsquo;s episode, Joe explains than Nancy-girls could kick Nancy-boys&amp;rsquo; asses. Or something like that. Well, no, his sister&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;girl-boy&amp;rdquo; and girl-boys are tougher than girl . . .

In the process, you may well have defeated Al Qaeda worldwide.Â You suffered abuse at the hands of anti-American liberals, you overcame Donald Rumsfeld&amp;rsquo;s incompetent leadership, you left limbs and lives on the battlefield.</description>

      <description>Since A-B sold out to Belgian brewer InBev, things have changed in the St. Louis bar scene.
In a typical St. Louis County strip-mall bar during a Friday happy hour about 70 percent of the male patrons would sit behind an Anheuser-Busch product&amp;ndash;Budweiser, Bud Select, Bud Light, Michelob Ultra, even Busch.
Not anymore.
I stopped drinking Select as soon as the announcement of the buyout came last Sunday.Â But I was shocked last night when I walked into The Corner Pub &amp;amp; Grill in West St.</description>

The study shows that Atkins-like, low-carbohydrate diets are the most effective kind for both weight loss and good health.Â That joys me, because the only way I can lose and keep of weight is with low carbs.Â Even when I was running half marathons, I was well over 200 lbs on a 6-1 frame.</description>

      <description>Michelle Malkin points out a skit on YouTube by comedian Damon Wayans: Abortionman. Michelle asks:
Is Wayans really trying to send an anti-abortion message here? Or is this just sophomoric, exploitative garbage masquerading as faux social criticism?
I&amp;rsquo;m a hyperbolist, myself, so I tend to see this as sophomoric anti-abortion speech. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s exploitive: it exploits those who treat infanticide as a coin-flip decision. It exploits the moronic pro-abortion arguments the dehumanize unborn children.</description>

      <description>Pope Benedict XVI will receive the highest honor the United States can bestow upon on a visiting head of state: the President will meet him at the airport. Afterwards, the White House will host the largest gathering of Bush&amp;rsquo;s presidency, as over 12,000 guests will receive His Holiness. Quite an honor.
Sadly, Catholic hate mobs will be out in force, too. Excommunicates who believe they know God&amp;rsquo;s designs for the church better than the Pope will travel from St.</description>

      <description>People love Billy Bob Thornton . . . or they hate him. Either way, they owe themselves a listen to selections from his new band&amp;rsquo;s new album.
The Boxmasters combine the English Invasion with 60s hillbilly music to form &amp;ldquo;electric hillbilly.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s heavy on steel guitar, which gives all their songs the twang that screams &amp;ldquo;old country.&amp;rdquo; I love the sound.

      <description>No matter how painful, eventually you must go into his room. Each book on the shelves, every dirty sock strewn carelessly on the floor in anticipation of picking it up tomorrow, the odd angle of the pillow on the bed, and the scent&amp;ndash;oh, God, above all the scent&amp;ndash;remind you both of the life and of its passing. Still, you must open the door, for his passing didn&amp;rsquo;t relieve you of your duties.</description>

      <title>Oprah and the Racist Rev</title>

      <description>I watched tonight&amp;rsquo;s edition of one my favorite shows, &amp;ldquo;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.&amp;rdquo; Following is Oprah&amp;rsquo;s Big Give.
I was never a huge Oprah Winfrey fan, but learning that she chooses an anti-American racist as her minister poisoned whatever good feelings I might have had for her.
Differences between races because of cultural histories are certain. Oprah and Obama, though, demonstrate, in their allegiance to Reverend Wright, a moral corruption that cannot be papered over with soothing rhetoric or million dollar giveaways.</description>

      <description>Roger Kreutz dashed to right a wrong. A tiny wrong, by modern standards, but a wrong nonetheless. &amp;ldquo;Dammit,&amp;rdquo; Roger might have thought, &amp;ldquo;you can&amp;rsquo;t even enjoy a quiet cup of coffee anymore.&amp;rdquo; Then he sprang into action.
Aaron Poisson has a girlfriend and a car. And he&amp;rsquo;s out of high school. That&amp;rsquo;s a liberating combination to a young man. The boundaries of his youth&amp;ndash;walls to many young men aching to break the chains of childhood&amp;ndash;are far behind him.</description>

      <title>The Joy of Family</title>

      <description>Last Saturday I had the pleasure of attending an aunt and uncle&amp;rsquo;s 50th wedding anniversary. A foot of snow reflected brilliant white sunlight on a sixty-degree day that seemed more like Colorado than Missouri. But our location was obvious by the unmistakable eagles-in-As adorning every fixture at the Anheuser-Busch Center in southwest St. Louis County.
I cherish every Hennessy family get-together, but this one was special. There was no funeral parlor to visit, no Rosary at 10:00 p.</description>

      <description>I understand that Scarlett Johansen&amp;rsquo;s remarkable, incredible, indescribable attractiveness came with aÂ heavy doseÂ of anti-Hennessy knee-jerkism. I forgive her.For one thing, she&amp;rsquo;s desirable like a mattress after a 72 hour day.For another, she spent a long day with our heroes in the Middle East. BlackfiveÂ has the video.

      <description>I hope 2008 is the best year yet . . . for all of us.
Most particularly, may our men in women in uniform continue to fight their good fight, kick the enemy&amp;rsquo;s ass, and catch a non-stop home to have a celebratory beer with us.
We miss you kids, but we thank God you&amp;rsquo;re doing His work on our behalf.</description>

      <description>I few years back, I went through some pretty tough times. I wrote about my situation on this blog. I won&amp;rsquo;t link to it, because I really don&amp;rsquo;t want you to read it. Financially, my family was in bad shape. Though we&amp;rsquo;re still together and very happy, that financial situation put strains on our marriage.
Hard work, persistence, an abject refusal to give in, and God&amp;rsquo;s grace (no doubt granted by your prayers) has delivered us to a great place in life.</description>

      <description>I just blogged about the bad, sad events in St. Louis, Missouri, today. A 22-year-old police officer shot to death on duty; a famous, majestic church burned.
But looking around the internet, I find bad news all over. It was one of those days when the world&amp;rsquo;s rhythms crossed into bad vibes.
Some of those vibrations shook the earth in Peru, to the tune of 8.0 on the Richter scale, killing at least 850, probably more.</description>

      <description>This morning, I heard the news of the murder of a young police officer.
Officer Norvelle Brown, only 22 years old and a rookie cop, made St. Louis headlines for the second time in his short career&amp;ndash;his short, honorable life.Â In April, Officer Brown responded to a hostage situation during a barber shop robber, defusing the situation and apprehending the armed robbers. He and another officer received citations for that action.</description>

      <description>The weatherâs always good, for one; too hot, too cold, it rained, it snowed. Work will workâoh work is fine; busy, slow, mean boss, long lunch. Fatigue can be my friend at times when my eyes just wonât stay open and energy that never ends comes in handy now and then. Kids are always under foot, it seems, wanting this and breaking that. My hairâs a mess or just got fixed or wonât stay put or needs a bath.</description>

      <description>The right casual jacket sets a mood, an image, and an expectation that can make an entire year somehow better.
It&amp;rsquo;s about this time of year when I get weary of summer. I start looking ahead to cooler days of the fall, the start of football training camp and regular season. Hockey in the future.
When I was a kid, I associated this time of year with getting a new fall jacket.</description>

      <description>Remember &amp;ldquo;Rush Rooms?&amp;rdquo;
These were restaurants in cities around the country where people gathered to eat lunch and listen to Rush Limbaugh.
To promote the social side of politics, I&amp;rsquo;d like to see a nationwide chain of &amp;ldquo;Fred Bars&amp;rdquo; where Thompson supporters get together for an adult beverage, laughs, and encouragement. No Kumbaya singing, though I know this proposal reeks of former Jesuit peacenik filth.
I make this call to St.</description>

      <description>When I revived this blog some months ago, I decided to set Chesterton as my ambition.ï¿½ Not to rival him, of course.ï¿½ But to embody his jovial, lively spirit.ï¿½ To write from his point of view.ï¿½
Go back to 1993, when I wrote _The Conservative Manifesto:_ï¿½ my goal was to carry on in the tradition of William F. Buckley Jr.ï¿½ After the book, I wrote for the fledgeling Town Hall Forum on CompuServe three times a week from August 1993 to about July 1995.</description>

      <description>It took me just a second
to stop and watch them play.
My coffee cup felt grown up
when the ball bounced toward my feet.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to smile at them.
My eyes did, though. And big
Then I carried on inside.
They won&amp;rsquo;t be there when I go out.
They&amp;rsquo;re like my coffee cup.</description>

      <description>St. Louis &amp;ndash; When someone says &amp;ldquo;the President,&amp;rdquo; I still think the reference is to Ronald Reagan. As JFK did for Bill Clinton and his generation, and as FDR did for my mom and dad, Ronald Reagan defined the presidency for me. He was my president. He is my hero.
Having just moved to St. Louis from Groton, Connecticut (fleeing taxes, among other reasons), I was busy this afternoon moving furniture from our bedroom to the basement of our house, which is just four years younger than our 40th president.</description>
