      <description>The most human approach to Coronavirus is to let it spread without overwhelming the hospitals in any location. Mitigation orders, such as wearing masks, stay-at-home orders, and maintaining six feet of distance, while well-intentioned, actually prolong the agony except in places that are in danger of overwhelming the hospital system.
The idea that we can maintain this near-complete shutdown of society for as long as Coronavirus exists is a recipe for disaster on a Biblical scale.</description>

      <description>We have all come to know some things about Dr. Deborah Birx, the doctor responsible for the White House&amp;rsquo;s Coronavirus response. Her clear explanations often highlighted the nightly White House Coronavirus Task Force press conferences.
