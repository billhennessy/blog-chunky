People have gleefully surrendered amazing new powers to governments. We have erected barriers between ourselves and all other humans on the planet. We have surrendered all of our rights, including the First Amendment. We have abandoned religion. The Catholic Church has ordered its priests to disobey Christ&amp;rsquo;s Great Commission by prohibiting baptisms. We have shut down every business that isn&amp;rsquo;t part of a global enterprise.

You probably know people who are concerned about a &amp;ldquo;surveillance state&amp;rdquo; developing. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re one of them. I know I am.
It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable fear.
Some police departments are using drones to spy on people in their homes, peering into living rooms and bedrooms with digital cameras and fining or arresting people who have more than the imposed limit of guests. The justification the state gives for these intrusions is, of course, coronavirus.

                Bishops have banned public Masses, but that hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped the Mass, especially the Traditional Latin Mass.
Monsignor Eugene Morris of the Oratory of Ss. Gregory and Augustine is livestreaming the Holy Mass each Sunday at 8:00 a.m. You can watch live on the Oratory&amp;rsquo;s Facebook page.
How to Get the Most from the Mass in Time of Pestilence Msgr. Morris has published a guide to keeping the Mass holy in this time of pestilence as we watch from home instead of participating in the pews.

Sometimes I think Pontius Pilate gets a bad rap.
Sure, he was ultimately the slithery politician who sentenced Jesus to death, but he was also the only person on earth who offered Jesus something of a defense.
When the Jews first presented Jesus to Pilate, Pilate told them to try Jesus themselves. But the Jews argued that they could not lawfully put Him to death (John 18:31).

                Jerry Garcia Was Wrong
Jerry Garcia of Grateful Dead was famous for saying &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s about the journey, not the destination.&amp;rdquo;
Garcia was wrong.
There are two possible destinations:
 Eternal perfection. Eternal misery.  It&amp;rsquo;s all about the destination. The destination is all that matters.
The journey matters only insofar as it determines the destination. If you know and pursue the right destination, the journey will be difficult, often painful, often lonely, often frustrating.

In an interview with Solène Tadié for National Catholic Register, Chiron said the demons possessing him mocked Jesus but feared &amp;ldquo;The Woman.&amp;rdquo;
About Jesus:
 They told me he did exist in the past but that he should be forgotten, as nowadays human beings no longer needed him. They even said that he was with their king now.

 My Protestant friends were angry at the goings on at the Amazon Synod.
It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for some Protestants to disagree with the Catholic Church. After all, that&amp;rsquo;s what makes them &amp;ldquo;protestants.&amp;rdquo; What is unusual is why the Protestants are upset at the Church.

Last night, I saw a tweet that broke my heart.
A woman wrote that her husband told her he was going to Mass after work. But he went to a bar, instead. She went to the bar. He was there. He was drunk.
She asked for our prayers.
I said one for her, and two for her husband.
The woman is a traditional Catholic, like me. Or what the Holy Father calls &amp;ldquo;rigid.

 And that&amp;rsquo;s the problem with name-calling. When we impose a derogatory label on someone, we invite scrutiny upon ourselves. We label ourselves as the opposite of the names we impose on others.

Being unpopular is pretty easy. And it&amp;rsquo;s hard, too. It&amp;rsquo;s easy because there&amp;rsquo;s only one rule, which we&amp;rsquo;ll get to in a moment. It&amp;rsquo;s hard for two reasons: beforehand, it&amp;rsquo;s scary to think about following the rule. Afterwards, it&amp;rsquo;s lonely and painful to have followed the rule.

From The Catholic Company:
 He was appointed by Pope St. Sixtus II as archdeacon over the seven deacons of Rome, and held the sacred duty of tending to the Church&amp;rsquo;s wealth and distributing alms to the poor.

My last reason for loving the Latin Mass (which I failed to list in that blog post) seems important: how American Catholicism has changed since the inception of the new mass in about 1970. So I turned to Georgetown University&amp;rsquo;s Center for Applied Research in the Apostalate for the numbers.
Catholicism is dying in the United States.

                Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to Latin Mass instead of the new mass. Latin Mass feels like home to me. It feels like a call to holiness. Every detail of the Latin Mass has meaning, not just to me, but to everyone who&amp;rsquo;s studied scripture. The words, the gestures, the artifacts like the communion rail all have deep meaning. I don&amp;rsquo;t think the new mass is heretical; I just don&amp;rsquo;t think it lifts us up toward God.

One of those opportunities to love came to us yesterday. Independent counsel Robert Mueller delivered to the Attorney General his final report on potential crimes involving the 2016 presidential election and the Trump campaign.
The lede of that story was this: no new indictments.

                Tina Turner not withstanding, love is not an emotion, and that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing.
In today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel (from the modern lectionary), Jesus tells his disciples to &amp;ldquo;love your enemies&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;pray for those who persecute you.&amp;rdquo;
But how? I find it difficult even to be around certain people, much less love them. Surely, Jesus wasn&amp;rsquo;t serious when He told us to love our enemies, right? If Jesus meant what He said, then I must not know what love means.

                My heart and soul needed a good spring cleaning, and Lent arrived just in time.
Lent is fasting season. Most people know what fasting is, but many people don&amp;rsquo;t know what religious fasting is for. What good does fasting do the soul?
Fasting is form of asceticism. That means intentionally depriving yourself of some comfort or sensual pleasure. Asceticism does not require pain or self-flagellation. Self-flagellation tends to lead to pride and should be avoided.

 Many Christians will be accused of crimes against the state for simply following Christ&amp;rsquo;s teachings and believing that Jesus is our lord and savior. When you are accused and at trial, the Holy Spirit will speak through you if you let Him. You won&amp;rsquo;t need to come up with your own defense. Anyone might betray you and cause you to be put to death, even your parents or your children.

Lent is a time of repentance and atonement in anticipation of the commemoration of the passion, death, and resurrection of Christ Jesus. The whole idea of repentance and atonement always bothered me.
Until now.
This year, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for Lent to begin.
First, I&amp;rsquo;ve been called to redirect my zeal away from politics and toward God. Instead of bringing people into communion with the Constitution and liberty, I&amp;rsquo;m asked to bring people to Christ and Christ to people.

You don&amp;rsquo;t have to do the novena to do say the Rosary. Just show up at any of the Rosary stations around the area at 3:00 on October 7. I&amp;rsquo;m helping organize one location at the Black Madonna Shrine in Eureka/Pacific area.

 We are at war. A war without borders, where no man is exempt but where most haven’t recognized, let alone been trained, to fight. Casualties often go unseen, but very few are left unwounded.

                You might think I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty hard on Pope Francis lately. I&amp;rsquo;ve questioned whether his refusal to deny Archbishop Viganò&amp;rsquo;s accusations. And I&amp;rsquo;ve indicated that, if the allegations are true, the pope&amp;rsquo;s resignation might be the best thing for the Church.
Please understand that my posts are about seeking justice for the many victims of this scandal, includes the many faithful who never directly abused by a priest but, nonetheless, have been harmed by the scandal.

                One week after Archbishop Carlo Viganò released his bombshell letter, it looks obvious that Pope Francis admits the key allegation: Francis knew McCarrick to be a serial molester, and he returned McCarrick to public ministry anyway. As we&amp;rsquo;ll see later in this post, Pope Francis has a pattern of letting molesters and their protectors off the hook.

                One man can confirm or deny the central allegation against Pope Francis. The Catholic Church needs that man to step up now.
In an 11-page letter by former US Nuncio (ambassador) Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, Pope Francis is accused of ignoring warnings about Cardinal Timothy McCarrick. Viganò claims he personally delivered the warning to Pope Francis in 2013. The pope allegedly ignored the warning and the dossier on McCarrick in 2013.

 Pope Francis ignored evidence of crimes and overturned punishment imposed by Pope Benedict on the wicked and disgraced Cardinal McCarrick. That&amp;rsquo;s according to a former papal nuncio and corroborated by a former first counselor to the nunciature to the United States speaking on the record. The two men have direct knowledge of the matter.
Pope Francis refused to comment on the allegations that he personally covered up McCarrick&amp;rsquo;s crimes.

                Thousands of religions have sprung up around the world. Most lasted less than a generation. Some lasted longer. Only five have shown the stability and breadth to be called &amp;ldquo;world religions.&amp;rdquo; They are Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam.
The Eastern religions—Buddhism and Hinduism—compartmentalize faith from daily life. They protect believers from the risks of a leap of faith. Philosopher Mortimer Adler dismissed Eastern religions because of this &amp;ldquo;logic-tight compartmentalization.&amp;rdquo; Religions that segregate faith from action dismiss believers of the need to take a leap of faith.

Today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel reading comes from John 6. John chapter 6 is all about the bread of life. In it, Jesus shocks his Jewish followers by announcing that they must eat his flesh and drink his blood to achieve eternal life.
When some of his disciples challenged this formula for immortality, Jesus doubled down, saying:
 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.

The communists in Russia outlawed religion. While some religions continued to operate, the government seemed to have a particular hatred of Catholics. Russian communists were familiar with the unique power of priests to consecrate the sacrifice and administer sacraments.

Jim doesn&amp;rsquo;t know this, but several years ago he planted a seed in my heart that has broken through the crust of the earth and is now starting to bloom. For his birthday, I want him to know how grateful I am for his wisdom.

                Last week, Pope Francis approved a change to the Catechism of the Catholic Church.
Longtime readers might recall that my views on the death penalty are a bit nuanced. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t always have the courage to express it.
In 2014, I wrote:
 I don’t buy the idea that the death penalty is no deterrent. I don’t buy the notion that the death penalty should be banned. I think the availability of such a punishment serves its purpose.

Some people would expect me to recommend that we all prepare for combat. I don&amp;rsquo;t. I do recommend people prepare for hardship. (I&amp;rsquo;ll write about how in the future.

                Happiness Did you know that the word &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;blessed?&amp;rdquo;
Neither did I. But when I heard this on EWTN Radio the other day, I remembered there are two translations of the Beatitudes. One version goes with &amp;ldquo;Blessed are . . .&amp;rdquo; and the other with &amp;ldquo;Happy are . . . .&amp;rdquo; So, I guess it&amp;rsquo;s true. The words are interchangeable.
Happiness, then, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean walking around in some lithium-induced state of bliss.

What Fasting Can Do Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened to you during the fast (if you followed the prescription):
 You probably lost about five pounds. Your pants feel looser. You pull your belt a notch tighter. You saved money. (I saved $98.)  You learned that food is an option most of the time.

                Many years ago, a company hired a new president.
After several months on the job, this new president learned that most of his employees couldn&amp;rsquo;t pick him out of a line-up. He spent so much time in his office or in meetings or traveling that he rarely met with the people who reported to him.
To fix this problem, he set up a series of lunches. They were off-site at restaurants around town.

But this Primary Fast will last only 14. Some fasts require that you eat nothing during the fast. But this Primary Fast lets you eat one full, wonderful meal a day. Did you know that General Stanley McChrystal has lived on just one meal a day for decades. And one meal a day was enough to drive him through the war against al Qaeda.

In the 1980s and into 1990s, I read a lot. Philosophical. Religious. Legal. Historical. Lots of angles, but few perspectives. You see, I sought out confirming information. I searched high and low for perspectives that would justify my own.

                An enduring criticism of the Church over a millennium involves its wealth and opulence. Its cathedrals were often the most expensive and ornate structures in entire nations, save for monarch’s palaces. Lavish ceremonies mark significant milestones, such as the installation of a new pope.

So Pope Francis’s instruction to the bishops and faithful of his homeland Argentina says everything about why this pope will be different from all other popes.

Lent prepares us for the cycle of mortality and resurrection, perfected by Christ, without which life has no meaning. It’s a time of humility. We call to mind our human brokenness in hopes of making ourselves better imitators of Christ.
On Ash Wednesday, we mark ourselves with the sign of the cross in ashes. **“Remember, man, that you are dust and unto dust you shall return (Genesis 3:19).

History speaks of the massive Roman persecution of Christians. The catacombs of Rome, housing the remains of thousands of Christian martyrs, tell us the story and give voice to the dead.
But the Romans had nothing on we moderns when it comes to persecuting Christians. Today, Christians are the most persecuted religious group on the planet. And the problem grows worse every day.

While it’s understandable that a Christian church would treat Muslims as children of God, we are obliged to do so in the context of their prayerful conversion to Christ. Tolerance does not require submission.
