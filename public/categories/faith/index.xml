      <description>By the grace of God, Jim Hoft, the Gateway Pundit, has called all Catholic Christian men to pray the Rosary at the statue of St. Louis IX, King of France, on Art Hill in Forest Park at Noon on Saturday, June 28, 2020. Please join us. If you cannot join us, please pray for us.
Pray that our intentions align with the will of God, that we do nothing out of vainglory or pride.</description>

      <description>A recurring theme in the Old Testament went something like this: the people of God (Jews) face a temporal crisis. The people of God surrender to a pagan nation, paying tribute to both the foreigners and to their gods.
Most of the chosen people assimilate with their earthly masters. During the Babylonian Exile, they largely abandoned circumcision and most of the Mosaic laws. The Temple was given over to orgies and terrible sacrilege.</description>

      <description>Could anything be more entertaining than watching a &amp;ldquo;woke&amp;rdquo; priest mock his own religion and its sacraments by spraying an infant with a water gun in the sanctuary?
        Yet, this is where the &amp;ldquo;reforms&amp;rdquo; of Vatican II have landed us. Satan himself has more respect for God than these vested buffoons who use Coronavirus as an excuse to mock God, mock His Church, and mock the seven Holy Sacraments.</description>

      <description>What kind of world will emerge from the coronavirus shutdown?
People have gleefully surrendered amazing new powers to governments. We have erected barriers between ourselves and all other humans on the planet. We have surrendered all of our rights, including the First Amendment. We have abandoned religion. The Catholic Church has ordered its priests to disobey Christ&amp;rsquo;s Great Commission by prohibiting baptisms. We have shut down every business that isn&amp;rsquo;t part of a global enterprise.</description>

      <description>Do We Deserve Freedom?
You probably know people who are concerned about a &amp;ldquo;surveillance state&amp;rdquo; developing. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re one of them. I know I am.
It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable fear.
Some police departments are using drones to spy on people in their homes, peering into living rooms and bedrooms with digital cameras and fining or arresting people who have more than the imposed limit of guests. The justification the state gives for these intrusions is, of course, coronavirus.</description>
