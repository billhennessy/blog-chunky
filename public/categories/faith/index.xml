      <description>What kind of world will emerge from the coronavirus shutdown?
People have gleefully surrendered amazing new powers to governments. We have erected barriers between ourselves and all other humans on the planet. We have surrendered all of our rights, including the First Amendment. We have abandoned religion. The Catholic Church has ordered its priests to disobey Christ&amp;rsquo;s Great Commission by prohibiting baptisms. We have shut down every business that isn&amp;rsquo;t part of a global enterprise.</description>

      <description>Do We Deserve Freedom?
You probably know people who are concerned about a &amp;ldquo;surveillance state&amp;rdquo; developing. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re one of them. I know I am.
It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable fear.
Some police departments are using drones to spy on people in their homes, peering into living rooms and bedrooms with digital cameras and fining or arresting people who have more than the imposed limit of guests. The justification the state gives for these intrusions is, of course, coronavirus.</description>

      <title>Holy Mass for the 5th Sunday of Lent</title>

      <description>Bishops have banned public Masses, but that hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped the Mass, especially the Traditional Latin Mass.
Monsignor Eugene Morris of the Oratory of Ss. Gregory and Augustine is livestreaming the Holy Mass each Sunday at 8:00 a.m. You can watch live on the Oratory&amp;rsquo;s Facebook page.
How to Get the Most from the Mass in Time of Pestilence Msgr. Morris has published a guide to keeping the Mass holy in this time of pestilence as we watch from home instead of participating in the pews.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúConservatism is the tacit acknowledgement that all that is finally important in human experience is behind us; that the crucial explorations have been undertaken, and that it is given to man to know what are the great truths that emerged from them.‚Äù

      <description>Monsignor Eugene Morris livestreamed his private Mass for the fourth Sunday in Lent today. The Mass is preceded by the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
Monsignor&amp;rsquo;s wonderful homily is worth sharing with everyone you know.

      <description>And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

      <description>UPDATE: St. Louis Archdiocese has ordered all public Masses cancelled until at least April 6, including the planned Mass in Time of Pestilence.
I don&amp;rsquo;t normally invite people to my church explicitly. But I am about to because we are living in a time of pestilence.
Mass in Time of Pestilence: Wednesdays Each Wednesday for the remainder of Lent, my parish, the Oratory of Saints Gregory and Augustine, will offer a Mass in Time of Pestilence at 6:30 p.</description>

      <description>Quid Est Veritas?
Sometimes I think Pontius Pilate gets a bad rap.
Sure, he was ultimately the slithery politician who sentenced Jesus to death, but he was also the only person on earth who offered Jesus something of a defense.
When the Jews first presented Jesus to Pilate, Pilate told them to try Jesus themselves. But the Jews argued that they could not lawfully put Him to death (John 18:31).</description>

      <description>Jerry Garcia Was Wrong
Jerry Garcia of Grateful Dead was famous for saying &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s about the journey, not the destination.&amp;rdquo;
Garcia was wrong.
There are two possible destinations:
 Eternal perfection. Eternal misery.  It&amp;rsquo;s all about the destination. The destination is all that matters.
The journey matters only insofar as it determines the destination. If you know and pursue the right destination, the journey will be difficult, often painful, often lonely, often frustrating.</description>

      <description>A celebrity priest fired up Twitter today by endorsing same-sex &amp;ldquo;marriage&amp;rdquo; and by comparing a same-sex couple favorably to the Holy Family.
Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that the good father is not malicious but so poorly educated into reason and Church teaching that his embarrassing tweets make sense to him. Let&amp;rsquo;s pretend Fr. Sichko thinks he&amp;rsquo;s right.
To help educate the ignorant priest (and educating the ignorant is one of our Christian duties), I&amp;rsquo;ll pose some questions to Fr.</description>

      <description>A Frenchman named Michel Chiron was possessed by demons for decades. His story of exorcism revealed something remarkable.
In an interview with Sol√®ne Tadi√© for National Catholic Register, Chiron said the demons possessing him mocked Jesus but feared &amp;ldquo;The Woman.&amp;rdquo;
About Jesus:
 They told me he did exist in the past but that he should be forgotten, as nowadays human beings no longer needed him. They even said that he was with their king now.</description>

      <description>Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind. This is the greatest and the first commandment. (Matthew 22:37-38)
 My Protestant friends were angry at the goings on at the Amazon Synod.
It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for some Protestants to disagree with the Catholic Church. After all, that&amp;rsquo;s what makes them &amp;ldquo;protestants.&amp;rdquo; What is unusual is why the Protestants are upset at the Church.</description>

      <description>Call me &amp;ldquo;rigid.&amp;rdquo;
Last night, I saw a tweet that broke my heart.
A woman wrote that her husband told her he was going to Mass after work. But he went to a bar, instead. She went to the bar. He was there. He was drunk.
She asked for our prayers.
I said one for her, and two for her husband.
The woman is a traditional Catholic, like me. Or what the Holy Father calls &amp;ldquo;rigid.</description>

      <description>Rosary Coast-to-Coast at the Arch in St. Louis We are in a spiritual battle for America&amp;rsquo;s soul, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been fighting it all wrong.
Politics is important. Christians should engage. But politics isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. And politics isn&amp;rsquo;t first.

      <title>Rigid vs Squishy</title>
      <link>https://hennessysview.com/post/2019/rigid-vs-squishy/</link>

      <guid>https://hennessysview.com/post/2019/rigid-vs-squishy/</guid>
      <description>The opposites of &amp;ldquo;rigid&amp;rdquo; are more unflattering than rigidity:
 lenient indulgent broken compromising easy imprecise indefinite inexact irresolute unfixed unreliable accommodating liberal permissive resigned soft-hearted
 And that&amp;rsquo;s the problem with name-calling. When we impose a derogatory label on someone, we invite scrutiny upon ourselves. We label ourselves as the opposite of the names we impose on others.
Some of us are better at name-calling, or &amp;ldquo;labelling,&amp;rdquo; than others. Donald Trump does a lot of labeling.</description>

      <description>A friend commented on a recent blog of mine that he misses my political analysis. So I need to make this clear: my political analysis is that all problems in the world are demonic in nature.
I&amp;rsquo;ll write that again so no one&amp;rsquo;s confused: all problems, including all political problems, are demonic. Stop inviting Satan and the demons out of the abyss God made for them, and problems go away.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to write a book called How to Lose Friends and Alienate People. But nobody reads autobiographies anymore. So I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you how to be unpopular, instead.
Being unpopular is pretty easy. And it&amp;rsquo;s hard, too. It&amp;rsquo;s easy because there&amp;rsquo;s only one rule, which we&amp;rsquo;ll get to in a moment. It&amp;rsquo;s hard for two reasons: beforehand, it&amp;rsquo;s scary to think about following the rule. Afterwards, it&amp;rsquo;s lonely and painful to have followed the rule.</description>

Our nation, the Catcholic Church, and the whole world needs prayer. Why? Just read this post.
St. Padre Pio&amp;rsquo;s respond to problems was, &amp;ldquo;Bring me my weapon!&amp;rdquo; His weapon was his Holy Rosary. He prayed the Rosary to combat sin and evil. And it worked!</description>

I wish, though, his excellency had addressed the real cause of Catholics losing their faith: the ugly and sacrilegious farce that is the Novus Ordo (or Ordinary Form) Mass.
Here&amp;rsquo;s Bishop Barron&amp;rsquo;s initial tweet. I urge you to watch the video attached.</description>

      <description>St. Lawrence of Rome is the patron saint of comedians. I had no idea there was one. But there is, and it&amp;rsquo;s St. Lawrence. He earned that designation for his obstinate and comedic refusal to deny Christ, even to his death.
From The Catholic Company:
 He was appointed by Pope St. Sixtus II as archdeacon over the seven deacons of Rome, and held the sacred duty of tending to the Church&amp;rsquo;s wealth and distributing alms to the poor.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Well,&amp;rdquo; said the priest, &amp;ldquo;at least they go.&amp;rdquo;
By &amp;ldquo;go,&amp;rdquo; he was referring to Mass.
By &amp;ldquo;they,&amp;rdquo; he meant the people who dress like tramps, talk and laugh through Mass, and know nothing about the Church&amp;rsquo;s teachings. People who are pro-abortion, pro-gay marriage, and pro-women priests.
&amp;ldquo;At least they go.&amp;rdquo;
Lex Orandi, Lex Credendi The law of prayer is the law of belief.
&amp;ldquo;At least they go&amp;rdquo; would be a legit argument IF what they &amp;ldquo;went to&amp;rdquo; left no doubt about what they were participating in.</description>

      <description>Simple minds seek simple answers.
A man kills innocents with a gun, and the simple mind blames the gun. When a dog sees an approaching shadow, he attacks his tail.
Mass Killings Are Modernism In Action Modernism leads us to simple, but wrong, answers. Modernists have one solution for all problems: consolidate all freedom, all power, all decisions, all goods, all authority, and all thinking into the hands of a few omnipotent men.</description>

      <description>(Disclosure: I am a traditional Catholic.)
Did you know that for every person who enters the Catholic Church in America six leave? It looks like this:
   Incoming Catholics Outgoing Catholics     1 6    Why?
Simple answers are often problematic, but one answer seems obvious: Catholic leadership sucks. The Church in America offers nothing larger or more significant than the paltry pleasures of television and Amazon.</description>

      <description>A prophet is someone who has the gift of recognizing how current behaviors, beliefs, and trends will bring calamity in the future. Prophets tell us what not to do, and predict the dire consequences that will befall us if we don&amp;rsquo;t listen.
And we don&amp;rsquo;t listen.
Yesterday, we looked at three reasons people don&amp;rsquo;t listen:
 The Semmelweis Reflex, which says people reject information that contradicts longstanding beliefs. The Power of the Status Quo, which says people believe the future will always be a linear progression of the recent past.</description>

      <description>Q: What was the epitaph on the hypochondriac&amp;rsquo;s tombstone?
A: &amp;ldquo;I told you I was sick!&amp;rdquo;
 I happened to see a Facebook post from the George Gilder today. The post announced why Gilder is coming out of retirement at age 79.
(I rarely look at Facebook, but there&amp;rsquo;s flooding in my town today. Facebook is the best source for reports from the ground.)

A Catholic parish has, as part of its mission statement, &amp;ldquo;we love this world.&amp;rdquo;
Does this bother anyone? Besides me, I mean.

      <description>The abortion company fires its CEOs as sloppily as it delivers &amp;ldquo;healthcare.&amp;rdquo;
Before that, the Trump Administration successfully cut some of Planned Parenthood&amp;rsquo;s federal funding, which may have precipitated the decapitation of its management team.
And, today, Planned Parenthood&amp;rsquo;s hand-picked judge tentatively ruled in complete favor with the journalist the company is suing.
Aborting Dr. Wen On Wednesday, Planned Parenthood clumsily fired Dr. Leana Wen as its chief executive. I guess you could call it a late-term firing, since Dr.</description>

This time, the left&amp;rsquo;s insanity arises from the final report of the special investigator, Robert Mueller, into alleged crimes committed by the presidential campaign of Donald Trump in 2015 and 2016.
Amazingly, what we are seeing in the reaction to that Mueller report was seen by an early father of the Church, St.</description>

      <description>I prefer the Latin Mass of 1962 (and a thousand years before) for at least 12 reasons listed here. My last reason for loving the Latin Mass (which I failed to list in that blog post) seems important: how American Catholicism has changed since the inception of the new mass in about 1970. So I turned to Georgetown University&amp;rsquo;s Center for Applied Research in the Apostalate for the numbers.
Catholicism is dying in the United States.</description>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to Latin Mass instead of the new mass. Latin Mass feels like home to me. It feels like a call to holiness. Every detail of the Latin Mass has meaning, not just to me, but to everyone who&amp;rsquo;s studied scripture. The words, the gestures, the artifacts like the communion rail all have deep meaning. I don&amp;rsquo;t think the new mass is heretical; I just don&amp;rsquo;t think it lifts us up toward God.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m doing Exodus 90. My exodus began January 21 and ends Easter Sunday, April 21.
Exodus 90 is Catholic thing. It challenges men to escape from the slavery of this world through prayer, asceticism, and fraternity. The asceticism includes abstaining from drinking.</description>

      <description>God gives us so many opportunities to love our enemies. How often do we take him up on those offers?
One of those opportunities to love came to us yesterday. Independent counsel Robert Mueller delivered to the Attorney General his final report on potential crimes involving the 2016 presidential election and the Trump campaign.
The lede of that story was this: no new indictments.

      <description>Tina Turner not withstanding, love is not an emotion, and that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing.
In today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel (from the modern lectionary), Jesus tells his disciples to &amp;ldquo;love your enemies&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;pray for those who persecute you.&amp;rdquo;
But how? I find it difficult even to be around certain people, much less love them. Surely, Jesus wasn&amp;rsquo;t serious when He told us to love our enemies, right? If Jesus meant what He said, then I must not know what love means.</description>

The constitutional president, Juan Guaido, has called on Venezuelans to pour into the capital city of Caracas to demand the communist dictator Madura surrender. Guaido correctly points out that Maduro&amp;rsquo;s socialism caused the problem.
Guaido&amp;rsquo;s call is great, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go far enough.</description>

      <description>My heart and soul needed a good spring cleaning, and Lent arrived just in time.
Lent is fasting season. Most people know what fasting is, but many people don&amp;rsquo;t know what religious fasting is for. What good does fasting do the soul?
Fasting is form of asceticism. That means intentionally depriving yourself of some comfort or sensual pleasure. Asceticism does not require pain or self-flagellation. Self-flagellation tends to lead to pride and should be avoided.</description>

 Many Christians will be accused of crimes against the state for simply following Christ&amp;rsquo;s teachings and believing that Jesus is our lord and savior. When you are accused and at trial, the Holy Spirit will speak through you if you let Him. You won&amp;rsquo;t need to come up with your own defense. Anyone might betray you and cause you to be put to death, even your parents or your children.</description>

      <description>I have never looked forward to the start of Lent.
Lent is a time of repentance and atonement in anticipation of the commemoration of the passion, death, and resurrection of Christ Jesus. The whole idea of repentance and atonement always bothered me.
Until now.
This year, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for Lent to begin.
First, I&amp;rsquo;ve been called to redirect my zeal away from politics and toward God. Instead of bringing people into communion with the Constitution and liberty, I&amp;rsquo;m asked to bring people to Christ and Christ to people.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s start, as we should always, with the Word. In this case, the Book of Matthew 5:43-45:

Don&amp;rsquo;t take this lightly.¬†Father Richard Heilman and folks at the Holy League have asked Christians to pray the Lorica of St. Patrick for Justice Kavanaugh, substituting &amp;ldquo;Brett Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Justice Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; for the first person pronouns.

A few decades ago, it still applied to the training of young humans, but that&amp;rsquo;s pass√® now.¬†Yet, of all the minor virtues, this one seems the most lacking, the most valuable, and most difficult for libertarians like me.¬†I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of obedience.¬†My Lesson in Obedience Obedience, like many other virtues, is easy to talk about and difficult to execute.</description>

      <description>Stella Is My Teacher This is probably disturbing to theologians and apologists, but it makes sense to me. When I struggle with how to relate personally to Christ, I think of the way my dog relates to me. And when I wonder how God feels about me, I think about how I feel about my dog.¬†Dogs treat their people the way we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to treat God. And we respond to dogs in a way that teaches us how God responds to us.</description>

      <description>A faction in America seems hellbent on destroying the country in order to save it from Donald Trump. What do we owe them?
For many years, I wrote and preached that we owe them contempt and anger. That we must fight them tooth and nail. And that we must prevail.
And we did. And our victories led to bigger battles. The thrill of victory proved fleeting.
Don&amp;rsquo;t you hope for a victory that lasts?</description>

      <description>You might think I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty hard on Pope Francis lately. I&amp;rsquo;ve questioned whether his refusal to deny Archbishop Vigan√≤&amp;rsquo;s accusations. And I&amp;rsquo;ve indicated that, if the allegations are true, the pope&amp;rsquo;s resignation might be the best thing for the Church.
Please understand that my posts are about seeking justice for the many victims of this scandal, includes the many faithful who never directly abused by a priest but, nonetheless, have been harmed by the scandal.</description>

      <description>One week after Archbishop Carlo¬†Vigan√≤ released his bombshell letter, it looks obvious that Pope Francis admits the key allegation: Francis knew McCarrick to be a serial molester, and he returned McCarrick to public ministry anyway. As we&amp;rsquo;ll see later in this post, Pope Francis has a pattern of letting molesters and their protectors off the hook.

We were discussing my plan to become a Catholic Street Evangelist. My first prayer station event is September 16 under the tutelage of a seasoned team leader.
&amp;ldquo;Why do you say it like that?&amp;rdquo; I asked her.
&amp;ldquo;This is kind of a bad time to be out trying to bring people into the Catholic church, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo;
She had a point.

I&amp;rsquo;m talking about his recent series of letters and clarifications regarding how Catholics should express their obedience to the pope. Jim is partially right and partially off base.
What Jim Towey Gets Right Jim is right that that conservative Catholics need to be very gracious and obedient when they challenge the pope&amp;rsquo;s formal teaching on matters like the death penalty.</description>

      <description>One man can confirm or deny the central allegation against Pope Francis. The Catholic Church needs that man to step up now.
In an 11-page letter by former US Nuncio (ambassador) Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan√≤, Pope Francis is accused of ignoring warnings about Cardinal Timothy McCarrick. Vigan√≤ claims he personally delivered the warning to Pope Francis in 2013. The pope allegedly ignored the warning and the dossier on McCarrick in 2013.</description>

 Pope Francis ignored evidence of crimes and overturned punishment imposed by Pope Benedict on the wicked and disgraced Cardinal McCarrick. That&amp;rsquo;s according to a former papal nuncio and corroborated by a former first counselor to the nunciature to the United States speaking on the record. The two men have direct knowledge of the matter.
Pope Francis refused to comment on the allegations that he personally covered up McCarrick&amp;rsquo;s crimes.</description>

The Eastern religions‚ÄîBuddhism and Hinduism‚Äîcompartmentalize faith from daily life. They protect believers from the risks of a leap of faith. Philosopher Mortimer Adler dismissed Eastern religions because of this &amp;ldquo;logic-tight compartmentalization.&amp;rdquo; Religions that segregate faith from action dismiss believers of the need to take a leap of faith.</description>

      <description>Why do you stay a Catholic?
Today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel reading comes from John 6. John chapter 6 is all about the bread of life. In it, Jesus shocks his Jewish followers by announcing that they must eat his flesh and drink his blood to achieve eternal life.
When some of his disciples challenged this formula for immortality, Jesus doubled down, saying:
 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</description>

      <description>I heard a story a long time ago. From a woman who escaped the Soviet Union and came to America.
She told us how lucky we are in America to have priests. She urged us to pray in thanksgiving every day that we have priests.
The communists in Russia outlawed religion. While some religions continued to operate, the government seemed to have a particular hatred of Catholics. Russian communists were familiar with the unique power of priests to consecrate the sacrifice and administer sacraments.</description>

Being a coward, I avoided mass. I was too embarrassed. Week after week, my neighbors would see me not going to communion. I&amp;rsquo;d have to get up and let the communicants through, then kneel back down, often alone.</description>

This morning, I tried to listen in silence for God&amp;rsquo;s answers to my questions.
What do we say about the news out of Pennsylvania? How do we answer those who taunt and ridicule the Church? How do we settle our anger at the priests and bishops and cardinals who protected the pederasts for decades? How do we reconcile the hideous criminality of those men with the uncountable graces God freely gave them through the many sacraments they&amp;rsquo;ve received?</description>

In that workshop, we cite a lot of behavioral science research. We also point out that some behavioral science research is bogus. Up to 60 percent by a recent study (which might have been bogus itself.) So how do you know good science from bad?

So, eventually, God gave up the comforts of heaven and most of the perks of being God to become a man on earth and show us how to do it right. Instead of thanking Him for the tutoring, we ridiculed, tortured, and murdered Him.
Lucky for us, a few guys took notes while Jesus was here. And they published them.</description>

      <description>Last week, Pope Francis approved a change to the Catechism of the Catholic Church.
Longtime readers might recall that my views on the death penalty are a bit nuanced. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t always have the courage to express it.
In 2014, I wrote:
 I don‚Äôt buy the idea that the death penalty is no deterrent. I don‚Äôt buy the notion¬†that the death penalty should be banned. I think the availability¬†of such a punishment serves its purpose.</description>

Neither did I. But when I heard this on EWTN Radio the other day, I remembered there are two translations of the Beatitudes. One version goes with &amp;ldquo;Blessed are . . .&amp;rdquo; and the other with &amp;ldquo;Happy are . . . .&amp;rdquo; So, I guess it&amp;rsquo;s true. The words are interchangeable.
Happiness, then, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean walking around in some lithium-induced state of bliss.</description>

      <description>Many years ago, a company hired a new president.
After several months on the job, this new president learned that most of his employees couldn&amp;rsquo;t pick him out of a line-up. He spent so much time in his office or in meetings or traveling that he rarely met with the people who reported to him.
To fix this problem, he set up a series of lunches. They were off-site at restaurants around town.</description>

      <title>Primary Fasting</title>

      <description>I invite you to join a centuries-old tradition: fasting for a cause.¬†Moses and Jesus fasted for 40 days. But this Primary Fast will last only 14.¬†Some fasts require that you eat nothing during the fast. But this Primary Fast lets you eat one full, wonderful meal a day. Did you know that General Stanley McChrystal has lived on just one meal a day for decades. And one meal a day was enough to drive him through the war against al Qaeda.</description>

Lorica (Breastplate) of St. Patrick I bind to myself today the strong virtue of an Invocation of the Trinity: I believe the Trinity in the Unity the Creator of the Universe.
I bind to myself today the virtue of the Incarnation of Christ with His Baptism, the virtue of His crucifixion with His burial, the virtue of His Resurrection with His Ascension, the virtue of His coming on the Judgement Day.</description>

      <description>My mom and dad have two anniversaries. One anniversary celebrates the day my uncle Bob drove them to Hot Springs, Arkansas to elope. The other celebrates the day about a week later when, having learned of their civil nuptials, my grandfather ordered them to go see Father English and set themselves right with the church.
Like father, like son, I guess. Except, the kid&amp;rsquo;s a lot slower. Fifteen years slower.</description>

      <description>Today was a particularly busy day for me.
I had a series of meetings. Like every hour, another meeting. From 9:00 on.
I saw the text from my wife.¬†I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to click on a video. I was in a room full of people. Important business. Major client and all that. And I completely misunderstood the &amp;ldquo;H/T Gina L.&amp;rdquo; thing. For some reason, I thought Angela was mad at Gina.</description>

      <title>How Do You Justify the Death Penalty?</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not being judgmental or rhetorical with that title. I&amp;rsquo;m curious how other people deal with capital punishment.
Here&amp;rsquo; my story:
Once upon a time, I advocated for the death penalty. Loudly. Shrilly, at times.
In the 1980s and into 1990s, I read a lot. Philosophical. Religious. Legal. Historical. Lots of angles, but few perspectives. You see, I sought out confirming information. I searched high and low for perspectives that would justify my own.</description>

      <title>One Sentence Explains Everything About Pope Francis</title>

      <description>An enduring criticism of the Church over a millennium involves its wealth and opulence. Its cathedrals were often the¬†most expensive and ornate structures in entire nations, save for monarch‚Äôs palaces. Lavish ceremonies mark significant milestones, such as the installation of a new pope.

So Pope Francis‚Äôs instruction to the bishops and faithful of his homeland Argentina says everything about why this pope will be different from all other popes.</description>

      <description>I read today that the Christmas shopping season was off. The writer, or his sources, blamed Sandy: Hurricane Sandy and Sandy Hook. Retailers said that shoppers weren‚Äôt very jolly. They were serious or worried or distracted. Hurried, as if they didn‚Äôt want to be out too long.

I thought of my parents and others at the Christmas of 1941. Americans had endured a decade of economic depression that the planners were impotent to correct.</description>

      <description>Today begins Lent.

Lent prepares us for the cycle of mortality and resurrection, perfected by Christ, without which life has no meaning. It‚Äôs a time of humility. We call to mind our human brokenness in hopes of making ourselves better imitators of Christ.
On Ash Wednesday, we mark ourselves with the sign of the cross in ashes. **‚ÄúRemember, man, that you are dust and unto dust you shall return (Genesis 3:19).</description>

      <description>Marc, at Bad Catholic, rocks.
In this post on Obama‚Äôs continuing jihad against Christianity, he answers a burning question: did human happiness exist before artificial contraception?
Put another way, is chemical birth control a natural state of humanity?
Before you answer, read the post. Think about it.</description>

      <description>Do you know the most persecuted religious group on earth?
History speaks of the massive Roman persecution of Christians. The catacombs of Rome, housing the remains of thousands of Christian martyrs, tell us the story and give voice to the dead.
But the Romans had nothing on we moderns when it comes to persecuting Christians. Today, Christians are the most persecuted religious group on the planet. And the problem grows worse every day.</description>

      <title>Disturbing: United Church of Christ Advancing Islam?</title>

      <description>This is disturbing. A St. Louis area ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù church, Parkway United Church of Christ, on N. Ballas is promoting Islam on its sign.

This photo was snapped today, June 7, 2010 by Marcia Behr of St. Louis.
While it‚Äôs understandable that a Christian church would treat Muslims as children of God, we are obliged to do so in the context of their prayerful conversion to Christ. Tolerance does not require submission.</description>
