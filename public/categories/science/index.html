 It seems that NASA&amp;rsquo;s James Hansen, head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), is at it again. He just can&amp;rsquo;t let the data speak for itself. In yet another egregious display of Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) arrogance, he changed the temperature data from 1910-2008 to reflect what is clearly a cooling trend to reflect a warming trend.

                DailyTech - Sea Ice Ends Year at Same Level as 1979
 Thanks to a rapid rebound in recent months, global sea ice levels now equal those seen 29 years ago, when the year 1979 also drew to a close.
 Let&amp;rsquo;s give credit where it&amp;rsquo;s due: Al Gore.
When Al Gore speaks, the opposite happens. Where Al Gore goes,snow is sure to follow. So when Al Gorefrightened a bunch of German kids by telling them that the North Pole would be gone in 5 years, that Santa Claus would die along with his reindeer, and that Polar Bears would either become extinct or catch the last few ice floes south to Europe where they&amp;rsquo;d &amp;ldquo;eat little kiddies like you,&amp;rdquo; you just knew that the Arctic would grow ice faster than Joe Biden&amp;rsquo;s head grows hair plugs.

                The Huffington Post (of all things) brings us a most cogent, concise, and accurate repudiation of Al Gore and the whole &amp;ldquo;climate change&amp;rdquo; Nazi crowd (h/t ICECAP). Harold Ambler deserves the Nobel Prize for truth stating. Some highlights.
Strike One: How Al Gore (and Hansen and the rest) lie to you about climate change:
 First, the expression &amp;ldquo;climate change&amp;rdquo; itself is a redundancy, and contains a lie. Climate has always changed, and always will.

                The silliness of companies knows no bounds.
The latest act of corporate stupidity comes from the computer maker Dell.
In its attempt to become the &amp;ldquo;greenest technology company on the planet,&amp;rdquo; Dell made much of achieving some farcically theoretical &amp;ldquo;carbon-neutral&amp;rdquo; status. But, like everything associated with AGW, there&amp;rsquo;s really no so thing. WSJ points out in a wonderful examination today:
 In fact, that&amp;rsquo;s only a small fraction of all the emissions associated with Dell.

GDP and Economy: By July, everyone pretty much calls the situation &amp;ldquo;Great Depression II.&amp;rdquo; Unemployment, which declines in the first quarter, increases to more than 12 percent by fall. Gross Domestic Product by quarter:

 First, all over the world, temperatures have been dropping in a way wholly unpredicted by all those computer models which have been used as the main drivers of the scare. Last winter, as temperatures plummeted, many parts of the world had snowfalls on a scale not seen for decades.

                The increased urgency to legislate or judicially impose new, draconian burdens on society to &amp;ldquo;save the planet&amp;rdquo; is not your imagination. Neither is it a response to increasingly rising temperatures. Temperatures have been falling for 8 years now, and have not risen in more than 10. The reason the AGW alarmists need to impose restrictions is: credit. Remember the ozone holes? According to leftists, the holes were caused by chloroflourocarbons like refrigerant used in air conditioning.

                Even as CO2 levels rise, western Lake Superior is freezing over for the first time years.
 The western tip of Lake Superior has frozen over in December for the first time in recent memory, and that could mean a long season of ice angling that hasn’t been seen in years.
 “We were just talking that it’s been something like 17 years since we had a good, long ice fishing season at this corner of Lake Superior,’’ said Russ Francisco, owner of Marine General sporting goods store in Duluth.

                Seth Borenstein seems to have dropped the same Global Warming LSD as Al Gore.
Today, in a news article (not opinion, mind you) Borenstein claims that the 10-year cooling trend we&amp;rsquo;re in proves the seriousness of his personal brand of Global Warming. He also passes along flat out lies about temperatures and, especially, sea ice extent&amp;ndash;making up facts that never existed. Borenstein is a terrible polemicist and lazy researcher.
But Borenstein excels as a writer.

All of the October surface station temperature from Russia was corrupted. So what did Hansen do? He simply copied and pasted Russia&amp;rsquo;s temperatures for September into October and reported that October 2008 was the hottest October on record.

                According to reports, Barack Obama will spend most of the afternoon of January 20, 2009, signing Executive Orders to ban or limit activities that produce CO2. Bankrupting the coal and steel industries apparently can&amp;rsquo;t wait for legislative action.
Why the rush? Why is Obama in such a hurry to put tens of thousands of people out of work?
Obama and the left want to get CO2 laws in place so they can claim the laws stopped and reversed global warming.

                The image below from from University of Illinois shows that Arctic Sea ice nearly matches 1980 levels in area, and far exceeds 1980 in concentration.
    Remember the AGW crowd&amp;rsquo;s hysteria from this time last year until about June of this year? Scientists predicted that the Arctic would be ice-free?
First, this shows nature&amp;rsquo;s ability to heal itself far exceeds man&amp;rsquo;s ability to heal it. Second, it shows that the AGW crowd are liars.

                Senator and VP candidate Joe Biden today broke from the DNC and from Barack Obama declaring his belief that life begins at conception, according to the New York Times.
Biden must have a very difficult time reconciling that belief with his public support of abortion rights. If he truly believes that life begins at conception, supporting abortion under and circumstances is tantamount to advocating murder.
Biden admits that he cannot fully reconcile the two opposing views:

In other words, in the UK, thou shalt not question global warming.

One such appears on the Telegraph today. Christopher Booker (corrected link) notes that Dr. Hansen&amp;rsquo;s GISS center is alone in seeing continued warming throughout the world. Pointing out that laws supported by Hansen, Al Gore, and others will cost tens of trillions of dollars and severely limit freedoms throughout the world for the generations, Booker rightly contends that those proposing such a retreat from liberty be damn well sure they&amp;rsquo;re right.

Unfortunately for Al Gore, the past year saw almost every tenet, speculation, and idea about greenhouse gasses and man-made global warming fall to the scrutiny of science: * The Tree Ring theory upon which Mann relied was proven wrong, as tree leaves maintain a constant internal temperature of 21.

                Do you believe in human-caused global warming? Do you know that the earth wobbles? Do you know that the Antarctic ice shelf is growing and shifting from one side of the earth to the other? If you answered a throaty, certain &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to the first question but a less confident &amp;ldquo;I think so&amp;rdquo; to the next two, you better do some homework. Your prejudice toward human-cause global warming could be in danger.

                Here [DailyTech] and elsewhere I see many greenhouse believers hanging their hats on &amp;ldquo;scientific consensus,&amp;rdquo; as if it were the equal of scientific proof. That&amp;rsquo;s disturbing. (h/t Evan Jones blogging on WattsUpWithThat.)
When Drs. Marshall and Warren discovered that ulcers were primarily caused by bacterial infection, the scientific consensus was to deprive them of their licenses to practice medicine. One hundred percent of gastro-intestinal physicians and researches agreed that over-production of acid caused stomach ulcers.

The high number of referrals from this AOL article (reprinted from the New York Times) led me to reading, and reading revealed an interesting tone coming from the global warming alarmists: their hubris wanes.
Carl Mears, a global warming believer, said, &amp;ldquo;Temperatures are very likely to recover after the La Niña event is over.&amp;rdquo;

                When some people suggested that sun influences earth&amp;rsquo;s climate, the wack0 pseudo-scientists scoffed. &amp;ldquo;How could man possibly influence the sun?&amp;rdquo; they asked.
Now, two prominent climate scientists, Robert Toggweiler of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University and Joellen Russell, assistant professor of biogeochemical dynamics at the University of Arizona, conclude that wind has a larger influence on Arctic ice than man. (h/t Gateway Pundit).
 It&amp;rsquo;s not ice melt but rather wind circulation that drives ocean currents northward from the tropics.

                A staph infection strain that killed 19,000 Americans in 2005 and was formerly contained to hospital is now spreading among gay men in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York. (Reuters via Drudge).
 Sexually active gay men in San Francisco are 13 times more likely to be infected than their heterosexual neighbors, the researchers reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
 &amp;ldquo;Once this reaches the general population, it will be truly unstoppable,&amp;rdquo; said Binh Diep, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco who led the study.

                I have been railing against idiots who think human activity causes global warming for years. I find it interesting, then, that the more evidence we get the I&amp;rsquo;m right, the more people believe that I&amp;rsquo;m wrong.
The latest evidence comes brilliantly from Jeff Jacoby via Boston Globe. Some of the facts:
 * Temperatures have been flat since 2000, even though CO2 in the atmosphere increased 4 percent * 2007, predicted by all alarmist models to be the hottest in recent history, was not * The second half of 2007 was one of the coldest in recent times * Ice in Antarctica is growing rapidly for the first time in 6,000 years * Al Gore is an idiot  There.

                Despite the Nobel committee&amp;rsquo;s best efforts, 2007 turned out to be a bad year for global warming hoaxters. Global, 2007 was the coolest since 2001. The 387 category 5 hurricanes predicted to strike Miami in at the rate of 3 per day until every (non-white) man, woman, and child was dead never happened.
In a glorious NYT op-ed, John Tierney lambastes the leftist, the global warming fearmongers, the idiot soccer moms who accept the non-science of greenhouse effect as readily as they accept their mediocre offspring are genetically superior any other nineteen human beings put together.

                This gem of bad news for environmentalist wackos comes from the U. S. Senate Committee on Environment &amp;amp; Public Works via Drudge: Fewer than half of all peer-reviewed scientists who have written on global warming endorse the idea of man-made global warming.
 Of 528 total papers on climate change, only 38 (7%) gave an explicit endorsement of the consensus. If one considers &amp;ldquo;implicit&amp;rdquo; endorsement (accepting the consensus without explicit statement), the figure rises to 45%.

                From the AP:
 Microorganisms locked in Antarctic ice for 100,000 years and more came to life and resumed growing when given warmth and nutrients in a laboratory.
 Okay, so science has reconstituted microorganisms that haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the light of day since the dinosaurs scoured the earth. And this is good news?
Here&amp;rsquo;s what the left will do with this information:
 * These microorganisms prove that human activity causes global warming, according to Al Gore.
