      <description>American Thinker Blog: Global Warm-mongering: More Silk from a Pig&amp;rsquo;s Ear
 It seems that NASA&amp;rsquo;s James Hansen, head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), is at it again. He just can&amp;rsquo;t let the data speak for itself. In yet another egregious display of Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) arrogance, he changed the temperature data from 1910-2008 to reflect what is clearly a cooling trend to reflect a warming trend.</description>

      <description>DailyTech - Sea Ice Ends Year at Same Level as 1979
 Thanks to a rapid rebound in recent months, global sea ice levels now equal those seen 29 years ago, when the year 1979 also drew to a close.
 Let&amp;rsquo;s give credit where it&amp;rsquo;s due: Al Gore.
When Al Gore speaks, the opposite happens. Where Al Gore goes,snow is sure to follow. So when Al Gorefrightened a bunch of German kids by telling them that the North Pole would be gone in 5 years, that Santa Claus would die along with his reindeer, and that Polar Bears would either become extinct or catch the last few ice floes south to Europe where they&amp;rsquo;d &amp;ldquo;eat little kiddies like you,&amp;rdquo; you just knew that the Arctic would grow ice faster than Joe Biden&amp;rsquo;s head grows hair plugs.</description>

      <description>The Huffington Post (of all things) brings us a most cogent, concise, and accurate repudiation of Al Gore and the whole &amp;ldquo;climate change&amp;rdquo; Nazi crowd (h/t ICECAP). Harold Ambler deserves the Nobel Prize for truth stating. Some highlights.
Strike One: How Al Gore (and Hansen and the rest) lie to you about climate change:
 First, the expression &amp;ldquo;climate change&amp;rdquo; itself is a redundancy, and contains a lie. Climate has always changed, and always will.</description>

      <description>The silliness of companies knows no bounds.
The latest act of corporate stupidity comes from the computer maker Dell.
In its attempt to become the &amp;ldquo;greenest technology company on the planet,&amp;rdquo; Dell made much of achieving some farcically theoretical &amp;ldquo;carbon-neutral&amp;rdquo; status. But, like everything associated with AGW, there&amp;rsquo;s really no so thing. WSJ points out in a wonderful examination today:
 In fact, that&amp;rsquo;s only a small fraction of all the emissions associated with Dell.</description>

      <description>After a 2 year hiatus from annual predictions, here&amp;rsquo;s what I see happening in the precarious Year of our Lord Two-thousand nine:
The Dow: The Dow trades within a range of 1,000 points with a daily average closing of 8,500.
GDP and Economy: By July, everyone pretty much calls the situation &amp;ldquo;Great Depression II.&amp;rdquo; Unemployment, which declines in the first quarter, increases to more than 12 percent by fall. Gross Domestic Product by quarter:</description>

      <title>Global Warming Disproved!?</title>

      <description>Hey, folks, I haven&amp;rsquo;t read the whole thing. But in the second paragraph we seem to find the answer to whole global warming problem: ignore it.
 First, all over the world, temperatures have been dropping in a way wholly unpredicted by all those computer models which have been used as the main drivers of the scare. Last winter, as temperatures plummeted, many parts of the world had snowfalls on a scale not seen for decades.</description>

      <title>Cooling Planet Escalates Global Warming Hysteria</title>

      <description>The increased urgency to legislate or judicially impose new, draconian burdens on society to &amp;ldquo;save the planet&amp;rdquo; is not your imagination. Neither is it a response to increasingly rising temperatures. Temperatures have been falling for 8 years now, and have not risen in more than 10. The reason the AGW alarmists need to impose restrictions is: credit. Remember the ozone holes? According to leftists, the holes were caused by chloroflourocarbons like refrigerant used in air conditioning.</description>

      <description>Even as CO2 levels rise, western Lake Superior is freezing over for the first time years.
 The western tip of Lake Superior has frozen over in December for the first time in recent memory, and that could mean a long season of ice angling that hasn’t been seen in years.
 “We were just talking that it’s been something like 17 years since we had a good, long ice fishing season at this corner of Lake Superior,’’ said Russ Francisco, owner of Marine General sporting goods store in Duluth.</description>

      <description>Even liberals are noticing that [global warming has been reversed](Can you explain the enormous hole in Earth&amp;rsquo;s magnetic field that allowed solar winds to flood our personal space on June 3, 2007? ).
  No doubt Gore and The One will take credit.

      <description>Anthony Watts runs one of the most fascinating web sites on the entire internet. If you don&amp;rsquo;t read it every day, you&amp;rsquo;re missing a great, free education.
Two stories today illustrate his Nobel-worthy work:
* The [Ionosphere](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/16/earths-ionosphere-drops-to-a-new-low/) is encroaching on our atmosphere, perhaps because [the sun seems to be dying](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/14/even-quieter-on-the-solar-front-another-all-quiet-alert-issued/)** The Earth&#39;s [protective magnetic field](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/16/earths-magnetic-field-has-massive-breach-scientists-baffled/) has a massive breach allowing solar winds to bombard us with space stuff  Both stories illustrate our minute understanding of our planet, its atmosphere, our solar system, the universe, and God.</description>

      <description>Seth Borenstein seems to have dropped the same Global Warming LSD as Al Gore.
Today, in a news article (not opinion, mind you) Borenstein claims that the 10-year cooling trend we&amp;rsquo;re in proves the seriousness of his personal brand of Global Warming. He also passes along flat out lies about temperatures and, especially, sea ice extent&amp;ndash;making up facts that never existed. Borenstein is a terrible polemicist and lazy researcher.
But Borenstein excels as a writer.</description>

      <description>Jenn Q Public asked if I&amp;rsquo;d heard that Al Gore&amp;ndash;the man Don Imus described as Evil Incarnate&amp;ndash;told a German audience that the North Pole will cease to exist in 5 years. He held up his hand, fingers splayed, to avoid any possible confusion.
  
Mark the date: according to Gore, on 12/12/2013, there will be zero ice north of the Arctic Circle. This would an amazing change in trends since global sea ice has been growing for 20 years now.</description>

      <description>The massive storm brewing out west will plunge Los Angeles into the 30s, threatening all-time record lows for that city. Seattle is looking at highs in the mid-20s for the week ahead. That&amp;rsquo;s cold. Amazingly, the Ottawa Weather Center predicted this blast last week (here and here).
Meanwhile, to the east and north or Southern California, blizzards will extend from New Mexico to Minneapolis. The cold and snow is forecast to continue for the next 48-72 hours, striking St.</description>

      <description>Since no one else will listen to his lies, half-science, and hysteria, the old man of GISS wrote a long letter to the president-elect.
Luckily for the rational world, Richard Courtney (pdf) excoriated Hansen for the letter and for Hansen&amp;rsquo;s continued crusade to end freedom as we know it. Courtney&amp;rsquo;s summary of Hansen&amp;rsquo;s conclusion may go down in annuls of the AGW debate as a masterpiece:
 That &amp;ldquo;conclusion&amp;rdquo; may be correct if it were based on evidence and reasoned argument, but - as explained above - it is not.</description>

      <description>Dr. Hansen apparently believes the world is as stupid as, well, as stupid as the world seems to be.
All of the October surface station temperature from Russia was corrupted. So what did Hansen do? He simply copied and pasted Russia&amp;rsquo;s temperatures for September into October and reported that October 2008 was the hottest October on record.
Why isn&amp;rsquo;t James Hansen in prison? The AGW argument has lost so much steam that he&amp;rsquo;s resorted this level of lying, fraud, and deceit.</description>

      <description>According to reports, Barack Obama will spend most of the afternoon of January 20, 2009, signing Executive Orders to ban or limit activities that produce CO2. Bankrupting the coal and steel industries apparently can&amp;rsquo;t wait for legislative action.
Why the rush? Why is Obama in such a hurry to put tens of thousands of people out of work?
Obama and the left want to get CO2 laws in place so they can claim the laws stopped and reversed global warming.</description>

      <description>The image below from from University of Illinois shows that Arctic Sea ice nearly matches 1980 levels in area, and far exceeds 1980 in concentration.
    Remember the AGW crowd&amp;rsquo;s hysteria from this time last year until about June of this year? Scientists predicted that the Arctic would be ice-free?
First, this shows nature&amp;rsquo;s ability to heal itself far exceeds man&amp;rsquo;s ability to heal it. Second, it shows that the AGW crowd are liars.</description>

      <description>Senator and VP candidate Joe Biden today broke from the DNC and from Barack Obama declaring his belief that life begins at conception, according to the New York Times.
Biden must have a very difficult time reconciling that belief with his public support of abortion rights. If he truly believes that life begins at conception, supporting abortion under and circumstances is tantamount to advocating murder.
Biden admits that he cannot fully reconcile the two opposing views:</description>

      <description>Steve McIntyre tears to shreds an anti-speech ruling by the British equivalent of the FCC, Ofcom. Ofcom ruled that a documentary &amp;ldquo;The Great Global Warming Swindle&amp;rdquo; violated rules, essentially, because the producers presented evidence contrary to the party line of the United Nations and the Labor government. In other words, in the UK, thou shalt not question global warming.

      <description>While my flaming headline (&amp;quot;Dr. James Hansen of GISS is a Liar and Fraud&amp;quot;) received a fair amount of attention, people a lot smarter than I are carefully documenting the facts that led to my unavoidable conclusion.
One such appears on the Telegraph today. Christopher Booker (corrected link) notes that Dr. Hansen&amp;rsquo;s GISS center is alone in seeing continued warming throughout the world. Pointing out that laws supported by Hansen, Al Gore, and others will cost tens of trillions of dollars and severely limit freedoms throughout the world for the generations, Booker rightly contends that those proposing such a retreat from liberty be damn well sure they&amp;rsquo;re right.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised to catch Obama in a lie; I am surprised that people continue to lie about global warming despite all scientific evidence (not doctored byJames Hansen) to the contrary.</description>

      <description>Brian Sussman writing on American Thinker, for one.
In an article titled, &amp;ldquo;James Hansen: Abusing the Public Trust,&amp;rdquo; Sussman writes:
 Topping it all, Hansen has allegedly received hundreds of thousands of additional dollars to further politicize the issue of global warming. According to Investors Business Daily, &amp;ldquo;How many people, for instance, know that James Hansen, a man billed as a lonely ‘NASA whistleblower&amp;rsquo; standing up to the mighty U.S. government, was really funded by [George] Soros&amp;rsquo; Open Society Institute (OSI), which gave him ‘legal and media advice&amp;rsquo;?</description>

      <description>Dr. Hansen purposely and with malice aforethought manipulates actual temperature observations in order to perpetuate a global warming hoax.
If I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, he can sue me. But he won&amp;rsquo;t, because he&amp;rsquo;s a fraud.</description>

      <description>It took the nanny-staters to more than a minute to scream at low-carb dieters like me about the Mediterranean Diet study released today.
The study shows that Atkins-like, low-carbohydrate diets are the most effective kind for both weight loss and good health. That joys me, because the only way I can lose and keep of weight is with low carbs. Even when I was running half marathons, I was well over 200 lbs on a 6-1 frame.</description>

      <title>Antarctic Ice Anomaly At All-Time High</title>

      <description>According University of Illinois&amp;rsquo;s Cryosphere Today, Antarctic sea ice is at an all-time high. (Yeah, I know &amp;ldquo;all-time&amp;rdquo; is relative, since records go back only 30 years. But the alarmists have no issue with treating 30 years as the sum of recorded history; why should I?)
   
On the other hand, Arctic sea ice had a bad week. Mounting evidence points to underwater volcanoes pumping superheated water toward the bottom of the ice as the major problem, but the hysteriacs will blame my cigarette smoke.</description>

      <title>The Greenhousers--At Least They Have Pluck</title>

      <description>Despite all scientific evidence now denying the greenhouse hypothesis, the greenhousers stand by their story. That story: global temperatures will continue to rise in direct proportion to the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere and for many years after CO2 emissions stop altogether resulting mass famine, flooding, death, and the Cubs winning the World Series.
Unfortunately for Al Gore, the past year saw almost every tenet, speculation, and idea about greenhouse gasses and man-made global warming fall to the scrutiny of science: * The Tree Ring theory upon which Mann relied was proven wrong, as tree leaves maintain a constant internal temperature of 21.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s something we&amp;rsquo;re doing right: growing more plants!
As CO2 levels increase in the atmosphere, so does vegetation. Why? Plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. WattsUpWithThat

      <description>Part I
The sun is the source and cause of all weather. The aggregate of weather is climate. When the sun changes, climate changes.
These are irrefutable truths of science, even though Dr. Mann, Al Gore, and the global warming hysteriacs skipped that chapter in their science books.
Part II
The downside of global cooling, or ice ages, is far worse for humanity and most species of fish, plants, and animals than the worst predictions of global warming.</description>

 Dutch researchers at the Technical University of Delft have developed what they say is the world&amp;rsquo;s first solar-powered speedboat, and it&amp;rsquo;s got all the luxurious trimmings one would expect.

      <description>The global warming hoax of the past decade, which reached a climax in 2006-2007, is in rapid decline. I&amp;rsquo;m no longer the only one noticing it. Add to that the news of a couple weeks back that no one in an ABC News poll of 1,197 US adults named Global Warming as an issue in this year&amp;rsquo;s elections. No one. Nada. Zip. Ain&amp;rsquo;t huntin&amp;rsquo;.
In desperation, then, Al Gore today pronounced the Myanmar Hurricane a result of non-existent global warming.</description>

      <description>The much ballyhooed link between hurricanes and global warming appears to have snapped.
A Houston Chronicle story describes the findings published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (a GW alarmist pub):
 One of the most influential scientists behind the theory that global warming has intensified recent hurricane activity says he will reconsider his stand.
The hurricane expert, Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, unveiled a novel technique for predicting future hurricane activity this week.</description>

      <description>Do you believe in human-caused global warming? Do you know that the earth wobbles? Do you know that the Antarctic ice shelf is growing and shifting from one side of the earth to the other? If you answered a throaty, certain &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to the first question but a less confident &amp;ldquo;I think so&amp;rdquo; to the next two, you better do some homework. Your prejudice toward human-cause global warming could be in danger.</description>

When Drs. Marshall and Warren discovered that ulcers were primarily caused by bacterial infection, the scientific consensus was to deprive them of their licenses to practice medicine. One hundred percent of gastro-intestinal physicians and researches agreed that over-production of acid caused stomach ulcers.</description>

      <description>When some people suggested that sun influences earth&amp;rsquo;s climate, the wack0 pseudo-scientists scoffed. &amp;ldquo;How could man possibly influence the sun?&amp;rdquo; they asked.
Now, two prominent climate scientists, Robert Toggweiler of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University and Joellen Russell, assistant professor of biogeochemical dynamics at the University of Arizona, conclude that wind has a larger influence on Arctic ice than man. (h/t Gateway Pundit).
 It&amp;rsquo;s not ice melt but rather wind circulation that drives ocean currents northward from the tropics.</description>

      <description>I have been railing against idiots who think human activity causes global warming for years. I find it interesting, then, that the more evidence we get the I&amp;rsquo;m right, the more people believe that I&amp;rsquo;m wrong.
The latest evidence comes brilliantly from Jeff Jacoby via Boston Globe. Some of the facts:
 * Temperatures have been flat since 2000, even though CO2 in the atmosphere increased 4 percent * 2007, predicted by all alarmist models to be the hottest in recent history, was not * The second half of 2007 was one of the coldest in recent times * Ice in Antarctica is growing rapidly for the first time in 6,000 years * Al Gore is an idiot  There.</description>

 Of 528 total papers on climate change, only 38 (7%) gave an explicit endorsement of the consensus. If one considers &amp;ldquo;implicit&amp;rdquo; endorsement (accepting the consensus without explicit statement), the figure rises to 45%.</description>

 Okay, so science has reconstituted microorganisms that haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the light of day since the dinosaurs scoured the earth. And this is good news?
Here&amp;rsquo;s what the left will do with this information:
