      <description>American Thinker Blog: Global Warm-mongering: More Silk from a Pig&amp;rsquo;s Ear
 It seems that NASA&amp;rsquo;s James Hansen, head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), is at it again. He just can&amp;rsquo;t let the data speak for itself. In yet another egregious display of Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) arrogance, he changed the temperature data from 1910-2008 to reflect what is clearly a cooling trend to reflect a warming trend.</description>

      <description>DailyTech - Sea Ice Ends Year at Same Level as 1979
 Thanks to a rapid rebound in recent months, global sea ice levels now equal those seen 29 years ago, when the year 1979 also drew to a close.
 Let&amp;rsquo;s give credit where it&amp;rsquo;s due: Al Gore.
When Al Gore speaks, the opposite happens. Where Al Gore goes,snow is sure to follow. So when Al Gorefrightened a bunch of German kids by telling them that the North Pole would be gone in 5 years, that Santa Claus would die along with his reindeer, and that Polar Bears would either become extinct or catch the last few ice floes south to Europe where they&amp;rsquo;d &amp;ldquo;eat little kiddies like you,&amp;rdquo; you just knew that the Arctic would grow ice faster than Joe Biden&amp;rsquo;s head grows hair plugs.</description>

      <title>Gloriously Goring Gore</title>

      <description>The Huffington Post (of all things) brings us a most cogent, concise, and accurate repudiation of Al Gore and the whole &amp;ldquo;climate change&amp;rdquo; Nazi crowd (h/t ICECAP). Harold Ambler deserves the Nobel Prize for truth stating. Some highlights.
Strike One: How Al Gore (and Hansen and the rest) lie to you about climate change:
 First, the expression &amp;ldquo;climate change&amp;rdquo; itself is a redundancy, and contains a lie. Climate has always changed, and always will.</description>

      <description>The silliness of companies knows no bounds.
The latest act of corporate stupidity comes from the computer maker Dell.
In its attempt to become the &amp;ldquo;greenest technology company on the planet,&amp;rdquo; Dell made much of achieving some farcically theoretical &amp;ldquo;carbon-neutral&amp;rdquo; status. But, like everything associated with AGW, there&amp;rsquo;s really no so thing. WSJ points out in a wonderful examination today:
 In fact, that&amp;rsquo;s only a small fraction of all the emissions associated with Dell.</description>

      <description>After a 2 year hiatus from annual predictions, here&amp;rsquo;s what I see happening in the precarious Year of our Lord Two-thousand nine:
The Dow: The Dow trades within a range of 1,000 points with a daily average closing of 8,500.
GDP and Economy: By July, everyone pretty much calls the situation &amp;ldquo;Great Depression II.&amp;rdquo; Unemployment, which declines in the first quarter, increases to more than 12 percent by fall. Gross Domestic Product by quarter:</description>
