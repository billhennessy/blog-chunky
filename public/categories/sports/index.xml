      <description>Jack Kemp is on the top of my wall of heroes. Literally. An autographed Kemp card sits on top of my bookshelf housing the works and images of my heroes.
As the NFL self-destructs, it&amp;rsquo;s worth reading about Jack Kemp&amp;rsquo;s work for civil rights. And for the Republican Party. And for conservatism.
Jack Kemp&amp;rsquo;s Activism Kemp did it all. And, thanks to Jeffrey Lord, we can remember Kemp&amp;rsquo;s finest moments of civil rights activism:</description>

      <description>By now you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the photo. The iconic photo. One lone Army Ranger veteran defying his team to salute the flag during the Star-Spangled Banner.

You know that Alejandro Villanueva&amp;rsquo;s jersey and t-shirt immediately became the best-selling merchandise from the NFL&amp;rsquo;s store.
Villanueva served three tours of combat duty as an Army Ranger. He&amp;rsquo;s authorized to wear the Bronze Star. He stood for his country. In Afghanistan with the Army and in Pittsburgh alone.</description>

      <description>Brain damage. They all have brain damage. And they&amp;rsquo;ll likely die from it. Like Aaron Hernandez.
99 out of every 100 football players have serious brain damage.
Kneeling for CTE NFL players and owners decided to show their disrespect to the flag, law enforcement, and the USA by kneeling during the national anthem. In a foreign country.
The president responded by saying the NFL (and the TV networks) would be in big trouble if people stopped watching or attending games.</description>

      <description>You might not know about Franco Harris. You might wonder why he&amp;rsquo;s so unhappy, like many of us are, with the NFL&amp;rsquo;s anti-American antics lately. But his wonderful heritage tells a lot about why my favorite running back respects America.
His dad was an Army soldier. His dad met his mom in Italy during World War II. They married and returned to New Jersey.
[Read this fantastic 1996 Baltimore Sun biography of Franco Harris.</description>
