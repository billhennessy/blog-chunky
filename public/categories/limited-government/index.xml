      <title>Does Missouri Need Another State Commission?</title>

      <description>Usually, I’m against any government adding anything to its list of functions. But our friend Carl Bearden points out a novel and needed commission proposed by Missouri State Senator Gary Nodler. If enacted, Senate Bill No. 587 would require Missouri to establish a 10th Amendment Commission.
Here’s language directly from the proposed bill:
 The commission shall examine actions of the federal government toward the state, and refer cases to the attorney general when the federal government takes steps that require the state or a state officer to enact or enforce a provision of federal law that lies outside Congress&amp;rsquo;s enumerated powers and intrudes on the sovereignty reserved to the states by the tenth amendment to the United States Constitution.</description>

      <title>Obama&#39;s New Era of Secrecy</title>

      <description>As a candidate, Barack Obama swore he would throw open the activities of government to light of public scrutiny. In his inauguration, he swore to disclose everything. As President, he has instituted strict rules of secrecy on White House actions&amp;ndash;except those of his predecessors.
Now, Newsweek&amp;rsquo;s Michael Isikoff, no friend of the right, notices the incongruity between Obama&amp;rsquo;s promises and his actual openess.
He finds that Obama&amp;rsquo;s openess executive order contains loopholes that the media have ignored until now.</description>

      <title>The Anti-American Presidency</title>

      <description>Barack Obama’s shameful and anti-American behavior this past weekend in Europe deserves the kind of scorn reserved for degenerate traitors like Benedict Arnold, the Rosenbergs, and Alger Hiss.
On Thursday in London, the President of the United States transferred America’s economic sovereignty from we, the people, to a small group of European central bankers.
In the words of former Clinton staffer Dick Morris, Obama “nullified the Declaration of Independence.” Specifically, Obama signed an agreement to create the Financial Stability Board comprised of European central banks and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.</description>

      <title>Obama To Control Banks Permanently</title>

      <description>The Obama administration has no intention of relinquishing dictatorial control of the banks according to financial expert Stuart Varney.  The government wants to control the banks, just as it now controls GM and Chrysler, and will surely control the health industry in the not-too-distant future. Keeping them TARP-stuffed is the key to control. And for this intensely political president, mere influence is not enough. The White House wants to tell &amp;lsquo;em what to do.</description>

      <description>MoveOn.org is the perfect advocate for big government; neither takes responsibility for the results of its positions. In fact, they don&amp;rsquo;t even review the results. They merely congratulate themselves on victory and seek a new horror to reign down upon the world. When it comes to MoveOn&amp;rsquo;s attack on President Bush, we&amp;rsquo;re lucky that RedState is watching.

      <title>Why Focus on Government Spending?</title>

      <description>The mounting government debt&amp;ndash;$2.98 trillion in recent bailouts and stimuli alone&amp;ndash;is an oppressive anchor around the neck of every American. Currently, every family of 3 is obliged to pay over $118,000 in the next 30 years. That&amp;rsquo;s a house payment with a variable-rate. In other words, the government has done exactly what helped cause the mess for individuals by borrowing beyond its means at a teaser rate of 0.8 percent. That Teaser Rate Will Skyrocket</description>

      <title>Obama Exercises Dictatorial Power by Firing GM CEO</title>

      <description>Barack Obama has asserted his dictatorial powers by firing GM CEO Rick Waggoner. The firing of a company’s chief executive by a US president should send chills down the spine of every American. This is totalitarianism defined.
While Hennessy’s View has been critical of Waggoner’s leadership at GM, we oppose illegal and unconstitutional dictatorial powers in the hands of any US president.
Nothing in the Constitution permits a sitting president to direct a private company.</description>

      <description>Obama to Give Gitmo Terrorists Welfare and Home in the USA
From The Weekly Standard:
 Some of the detainees, deemed non-threatening, may be released into the United States as free men, Blair confirmed.
That would happen when they can&amp;rsquo;t be returned to their home countries, because the governments either won&amp;rsquo;t take them or the U.S. fears they will be abused or tortured.
Blair said the former prisoners would have [to] get some sort of assistance to start their new lives in the United States.</description>

      <description>The parish or congregation that’s most generous at the collection basket is not necessarily the church that sends the most souls to heaven. Nor is the best attended church the one that saves the most. Yet the purpose of every Christian congregation is to put souls through the Pearly Gates, not to put butts in pews.
Michael Steele’s GOP made much, last week, of the fact that his party raised more money in February than did the Democrats.</description>

      <description>I won’t write much: I’m too angry.
He has not answered a single question without blaming Bush and the Republicans. He’s blamed the Republicans for the Democrat Congress!
He claims that “no one disputes” his prediction of the fastest economic growth in the American&amp;rsquo; history beginning THIS YEAR! Of course no one disputes it! Rational people don’t argue with insanity.
Finally, he’s a Marxist bent on destroying American liberty! We don’t need to know anything else.</description>

      <description>The House, which is unabashedly authoritarian, has passed the GIVE Act, requiring national-socialist indoctrination for your children.
That’s right. Obama is going to turn your kids into spies working against you and your elderly parents. Why? Because Marxists like Obama hate liberty. Liberty is their enemy. And you support liberty, then you&amp;rsquo;re the enemy, too.
Now, before you say I’m reaching, read the language.
Think Obama’s goal isn’t a totalitarian, Marxist state?</description>

      <description>Today, leftist Congressman Barney Frank (D-MA) called Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia a &amp;ldquo;homophobe.&amp;rdquo; But this isn&amp;rsquo;t about gay rights or homophobia. It&amp;rsquo;s about the many, many people like Barney Frank who believe that everything they don&amp;rsquo;t like about life is someone&amp;rsquo;s fault. It&amp;rsquo;s about the entitlement pandemic currently ravaging common sense.
Remember when you were a kid and your dad gave you a dollar (or, in my day, a quarter) for the Ice Cream Man?</description>

      <description>I did not watch America&amp;rsquo;s Toxic Asset on 60 Minutes for the same reason I&amp;rsquo;ve never read &amp;ldquo;Mein Kampf.&amp;rdquo; Some people&amp;rsquo;s words do not deserve my ear.
I find it interesting, though, that Mr. Obama&amp;rsquo;s 90 minute interview on a program called &amp;ldquo;60 Minutes&amp;rdquo; so eerily parallels his budget: he consumed 150 percent of what was available.
To those who watched our dictator-in-the-making, I ask a question, the answer to which should demonstrate that watching the propaganda piece was useles: what did you learn that you didn&amp;rsquo;t know before?</description>

      <description>The Missouri Information Analysis Center produced a report for Jay Nixon which was leaked by Missouri law enforcement officers. Perhaps the motivation for leaking was the chilling content of the report. The report classifies almost every conservative as a terrorist or potential terrorist. It encourages law enforcement to profile me and everyone like me.
Any of these &amp;ldquo;warning signs&amp;rdquo; could cause Missouri police officers to pull you over and handle you as a suspected terrorist: * A Pro-Life bumper sticker * A Ron Paul bumper sticker * A flag with &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t Tread on Me&amp;rdquo; * Anti-Tax bumper stickers * Owning a gun * Supporting any 3rd party in any election * Belonging to conservative organizations</description>

      <description>The speed with which Barack Obama has seized—is seizing—private enterprise amazes even radical conservatives like me. Quite honestly, I am losing confidence in anyone’s ability to stop him from making the United States into a hip version of the old Soviet Union. In his first 100, Barack Obama will have transformed the US government, completely erasing Ronald Reagan’s presidency—as it the 80s never happened.
The New York Times piece gives a great example.</description>

      <description>Read this.
THE MAGAZINE&amp;rsquo;S CREDENDA
Among our convictions: 1. It is the job of centralized government (in peacetime) to protect its citizens&amp;rsquo; lives, liberty and property. All other activities of government tend to diminish freedom and hamper progress. The growth of government(the dominant social feature of this century) must be fought relentlessly. In this great social conflict of the era, we are, without reservations, on the libertarian side. 2. The profound crisis of our era is, in essence, the conflict between the Social Engineers, who seek to adjust mankind to conform with scientific utopias, and the disciples of Truth, who defend the organic moral order.</description>

      <description>We’ve launched stlouisteaparty.com to keep non-facebookers up-to-date on the Tea Party movement in St. Louis.
The Tea Party is a grassroots movement that will overthrow Congress in a ballot box revolution in 2010. It gives voice to the silenced conservatives who have been told “shut up and pay your taxes” by administrations and Congresses R and D.
We’ve found our voice.

      <description>The Freedom of Choice Act, the most sweeping suppression of religious dissent ever considered in the United States, is poised to pass in Congress. This legislation will put the U. S. government on a collision course with the Catholic church that could fundamentally alter the relationship of the government to religions forever.
The Freedom of Choice Act would make it a crime for a hospital, nurse, doctor, or technician to refuse to take part in abortions.</description>

UPDATE: The eminent domain story appears to be a hoax. My apologies. I found it on several blogs that are generally reliable, so I assume the hoaxter is good at his craft

      <description>My light blogging owes to our efforts to change the world in a week. My role is, appropriately, miniscule.
When Congress listens, it will repeal the trillions of waste, fraud, and abuse it has produced over the past 4 months, it will stop proposed borrowing and bailouts, it will stop rewarding bad behavior in corporations and citizens, or it will retire. This time, there are no two ways.
 Using tools like Twitter, email, and Facebook, TCOT has provided at least 163 patriots a forum to voice its discontent on Friday, February 27 at 11:00 a.</description>

      <description>Great coverage of the St. Louis Tea Party on KMOV Channel 4 by reporter Matt Sczesny. Channel 4 has not posted the video (that I can find). I&amp;rsquo;ll link or embed it as soon as it&amp;rsquo;s available.
Please say &amp;ldquo;thanks&amp;rdquo; to Matt and KMOV for a fair report.
 Amy at Top Conservatives on Twitter has put together a convenient list of the Tea Parties across the country. This list is NOT exhaustive, as not all cities have a Facebook Event page.</description>

      <title>Uncle Barry’s Adding Machine Stimulator Regulation Gimmick</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago, shortly after his inauguration, Barry “The President” Obama panicked: the Republicans might talk the people out of the stimulus bill.
Barry moved quickly. But Barry is an organizer, not an engineer. He’s the cheerleader, not the quarterback. He moves mobs, not nations. And when panicked, he fell apart.
Barry decided to announce that life as we know it would economically end the Day After The Stimulus Bill Is Defeated.</description>

      <title>Obama Loses Support Faster Than Any President in Modern History</title>

      <description>From his inauguration to the end of his first month in office, President Obama has dropped between 5 and 7 percentage points in approval according to Fox News and Rasmussen, respectively. That&amp;rsquo;s the largest first month drop in approval rating of any president since polling began. Barring a major plebiscitory reversal in 2010, Obama will go into the 2012 election with no scapegoats and no Congressional help. The Democrat Congress under Reid and Pelosi is the least popular since polling began, and Reid and Pelosi promise to deliver more of what made them so unpopular.</description>

      <description>Yesterday it seemed that Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s principal goal in China was to detach human rights from . . . well, from everything. Today&amp;rsquo;s Washington Post reveals the real purpose of her trip: sales.
Barack Obama has, in a month, made George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s deficits look like surpluses. And he or his cabinet members promise about another $1.5 trillion in direct debt before the fiscal year ends in September.
To finance this socialist expansion of government, Obama must sell bonds and lots of them.</description>

      <description>In the polite political banter between liberal and conservative co-workers this fall, a liberal friend trotted out that tiresome, perennial Democrat litmus test: “They say the first act of a president is picking a vice-president; look how well Obama handled that.”
Okay.
Obama’s First Decision Was Disaster
During the campaign, Joe Biden was a laughing stock, relegated to the safe, blue states where—Obama hoped—the press would ignore him. They did not.</description>

      <description>Former eBay CEO—and conservative—Meg Whitman has had enough.
She’s watch liberalism turn California into America’s Iceland.
She’s running for governor.
Maybe she’s the next Reagan. Or Thatcher.
 Whitman built eBay from a tiny start-up to the dominant online auctioneer. She will face at least one other Republican tech exec in the battle for the party nomination &amp;ndash; Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner.
 Run, Meg, run.

      <description>Barack Hussein Obama might be the dumbest man ever to stand behind a podium bearing the Official Seal of the President of the United States of America.
No, wait. He is the dumbest man. And the whiniest. This is like listening to my kids complain about homework. Obama has no understanding of basic economics. He lacks any knowledge of the Great Depression. He seems to actually believe that the New Deal significantly reduced unemployment.</description>

      <description>The Constitution enumerates certain powers to the US government. Chief among them is national defense. Barack Obama, in his campaign and in his first two weeks as president, has demonstrated a callous disregard for that duty. His actions threaten to place Americans in grave danger. Safe Since September 11, 2001
Like many, I assumed that Islamofascist terrorists would strike the US within a month or two of 9/11. The reasons were obvious at the time: we were woefully unprepared, panicked, and confused.</description>

      <description>We on the right chided Obama supporters who claimed The One was ready for the Oval Office. Clearly, we were wrong: Only a seasoned, veteran politician could assemble a team of liars, frauds, cheats, hypocrites, and criminals as broad and deep as Obama’s cabinet.
Daschle’s Hubris
First, let’s set up some context. Here’s what your soon-to-be Health Socializer said about tax cheats on the floor of the Senate in 1998:</description>

      <description>Well, at least communism’s brightest symbol: piles of mattresses.
In this case, Obama’s politburo wants to buy and crush new cars and trucks. Yes, GM and Chrysler and Ford can produce all the cars and trucks they want. Since the public won’t buy them, the government will—and crush them. Crush them. I kid you not. This from Gateway Pundit:
Democrats want to include a new car crushing plan in the &amp;ldquo;stimulus&amp;rdquo; bill where the government would buy new cars and trucks that obtain less than 18 mpg and crush them</description>

      <description>The Democrat National Congressional Committee has launched an online petition calling forsanctamony directed at radio giant Rush Limbaugh. Why not me? I wrote &amp;quot; I, for one, hopehis presidency is a miserable failure but that the country somehow survives&amp;rdquo; before Limbaugh spoke similar sentiments. I started the Campaign to Hope Obama Fails; Rush is a Johnny-come-lately. A fair-weather fan. He&amp;rsquo;s probably a big Steeler fan all of a sudden, too. The next the Democrats feel the need to decry divisiveness, please send them to me.</description>

      <description>In 2005, I blogged about the fact that expert consensus is usually wrong. For instance:
 * More than half of the studies published in medical journals are later proven wrong. * Most experts predicted that oil prices would continue to rise to $200 a barrel as recently as last August, but gas prices have fallen more than 50 percent since. I based[ my prediction of oil in the $30s](https://hennessysview.com/2007/11/13/oil-price-collapse-coming/) on the simple fact that the experts agreed we&#39;d never see oil below $100.</description>

      <description>On Friday, US Premier Barack Hussein Obama tipped his hand on his plans of banning dissent. He told reporters that Republicans must “stop listening to Rush Limbaugh.”
Were Obama an ordinary politician, we’d take this comment as a harmless, oral wish. Limbaugh is an effective advocate for conservatism, limited government, lower taxes, freedom, and peace-through-strength—all things Obama hates.
Obama’s not a typical politician in the American sense; he’s a communist. He’s a totalitarian.</description>

      <description>Bill Clinton began his presidency in a recession, promising to make a middle class tax cut and more jobs his laser-beam focus. But first, he let gays into the military and sent his wife off to socialize medicine. Barack Obama began his presidency during a borderline depression, promising to save the country from economic collapse, lowering the seas, and scripting quality endings to Stephen King&amp;rsquo;s movies. But first, he symbolically flipped off everyone affected by Islamofascist terrorists,snubbed military heroes, andredifined ethics as the way one behaves when the whole world&amp;rsquo;s watching.</description>

      <description>One of Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s first actions as president will likely involve a series of executive orders ensuring that as many abortions as possible happen. Good government protects its most vulnerable citizens; bad government kills them. Nazi Germany killed the weak, the halt, the improvident. Of course, the Nazis trained specialist to carry out these grim and evil tasks. In America, we rely on ordinary citizens to do the killing for us.</description>

Americans hold hundreds of billions of dollars in credit card debt alone. To this add automobiles, student loans, mortgages, medical, and myriad personal loans and you arrive at the staggering figure of$2.55 trillion with a &amp;lsquo;t&amp;rsquo;. 
This massive debt&amp;ndash;encouraged and backed by the US Government&amp;ndash;makes us miserable. Seriously. Are you happy? If the debtor is slave to his lender, then the US Government is slave to China and Japan.</description>
