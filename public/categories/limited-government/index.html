                Usually, I’m against any government adding anything to its list of functions. But our friend Carl Bearden points out a novel and needed commission proposed by Missouri State Senator Gary Nodler. If enacted, Senate Bill No. 587 would require Missouri to establish a 10th Amendment Commission.
Here’s language directly from the proposed bill:
 The commission shall examine actions of the federal government toward the state, and refer cases to the attorney general when the federal government takes steps that require the state or a state officer to enact or enforce a provision of federal law that lies outside Congress&amp;rsquo;s enumerated powers and intrudes on the sovereignty reserved to the states by the tenth amendment to the United States Constitution.

                As a candidate, Barack Obama swore he would throw open the activities of government to light of public scrutiny. In his inauguration, he swore to disclose everything. As President, he has instituted strict rules of secrecy on White House actions&amp;ndash;except those of his predecessors.
Now, Newsweek&amp;rsquo;s Michael Isikoff, no friend of the right, notices the incongruity between Obama&amp;rsquo;s promises and his actual openess.
He finds that Obama&amp;rsquo;s openess executive order contains loopholes that the media have ignored until now.

                Barack Obama’s shameful and anti-American behavior this past weekend in Europe deserves the kind of scorn reserved for degenerate traitors like Benedict Arnold, the Rosenbergs, and Alger Hiss.
On Thursday in London, the President of the United States transferred America’s economic sovereignty from we, the people, to a small group of European central bankers.
In the words of former Clinton staffer Dick Morris, Obama “nullified the Declaration of Independence.” Specifically, Obama signed an agreement to create the Financial Stability Board comprised of European central banks and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.

                The Obama administration has no intention of relinquishing dictatorial control of the banks according to financial expert Stuart Varney.  The government wants to control the banks, just as it now controls GM and Chrysler, and will surely control the health industry in the not-too-distant future. Keeping them TARP-stuffed is the key to control. And for this intensely political president, mere influence is not enough. The White House wants to tell &amp;lsquo;em what to do.

                The mounting government debt&amp;ndash;$2.98 trillion in recent bailouts and stimuli alone&amp;ndash;is an oppressive anchor around the neck of every American. Currently, every family of 3 is obliged to pay over $118,000 in the next 30 years. That&amp;rsquo;s a house payment with a variable-rate. In other words, the government has done exactly what helped cause the mess for individuals by borrowing beyond its means at a teaser rate of 0.8 percent. That Teaser Rate Will Skyrocket

                Barack Obama has asserted his dictatorial powers by firing GM CEO Rick Waggoner. The firing of a company’s chief executive by a US president should send chills down the spine of every American. This is totalitarianism defined.
While Hennessy’s View has been critical of Waggoner’s leadership at GM, we oppose illegal and unconstitutional dictatorial powers in the hands of any US president.
Nothing in the Constitution permits a sitting president to direct a private company.

From The Weekly Standard:
 Some of the detainees, deemed non-threatening, may be released into the United States as free men, Blair confirmed.
That would happen when they can&amp;rsquo;t be returned to their home countries, because the governments either won&amp;rsquo;t take them or the U.S. fears they will be abused or tortured.
Blair said the former prisoners would have [to] get some sort of assistance to start their new lives in the United States.

                The parish or congregation that’s most generous at the collection basket is not necessarily the church that sends the most souls to heaven. Nor is the best attended church the one that saves the most. Yet the purpose of every Christian congregation is to put souls through the Pearly Gates, not to put butts in pews.
Michael Steele’s GOP made much, last week, of the fact that his party raised more money in February than did the Democrats.

                The speed with which Barack Obama has seized—is seizing—private enterprise amazes even radical conservatives like me. Quite honestly, I am losing confidence in anyone’s ability to stop him from making the United States into a hip version of the old Soviet Union. In his first 100, Barack Obama will have transformed the US government, completely erasing Ronald Reagan’s presidency—as it the 80s never happened.
The New York Times piece gives a great example.

THE MAGAZINE&amp;rsquo;S CREDENDA
Among our convictions: 1. It is the job of centralized government (in peacetime) to protect its citizens&amp;rsquo; lives, liberty and property. All other activities of government tend to diminish freedom and hamper progress. The growth of government(the dominant social feature of this century) must be fought relentlessly. In this great social conflict of the era, we are, without reservations, on the libertarian side. 2. The profound crisis of our era is, in essence, the conflict between the Social Engineers, who seek to adjust mankind to conform with scientific utopias, and the disciples of Truth, who defend the organic moral order.

The Tea Party is a grassroots movement that will overthrow Congress in a ballot box revolution in 2010. It gives voice to the silenced conservatives who have been told “shut up and pay your taxes” by administrations and Congresses R and D.

                The Freedom of Choice Act, the most sweeping suppression of religious dissent ever considered in the United States, is poised to pass in Congress. This legislation will put the U.

The Freedom of Choice Act would make it a crime for a hospital, nurse, doctor, or technician to refuse to take part in abortions.

When Congress listens, it will repeal the trillions of waste, fraud, and abuse it has produced over the past 4 months, it will stop proposed borrowing and bailouts, it will stop rewarding bad behavior in corporations and citizens, or it will retire. This time, there are no two ways.

                A few weeks ago, shortly after his inauguration, Barry “The President” Obama panicked: the Republicans might talk the people out of the stimulus bill.
Barry moved quickly. But Barry is an organizer, not an engineer. He’s the cheerleader, not the quarterback. He moves mobs, not nations. And when panicked, he fell apart.
Barry decided to announce that life as we know it would economically end the Day After The Stimulus Bill Is Defeated.

                From his inauguration to the end of his first month in office, President Obama has dropped between 5 and 7 percentage points in approval according to Fox News and Rasmussen, respectively. That&amp;rsquo;s the largest first month drop in approval rating of any president since polling began. Barring a major plebiscitory reversal in 2010, Obama will go into the 2012 election with no scapegoats and no Congressional help. The Democrat Congress under Reid and Pelosi is the least popular since polling began, and Reid and Pelosi promise to deliver more of what made them so unpopular.

Barack Obama has, in a month, made George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s deficits look like surpluses. And he or his cabinet members promise about another $1.5 trillion in direct debt before the fiscal year ends in September.
To finance this socialist expansion of government, Obama must sell bonds and lots of them.

Okay.
Obama’s First Decision Was Disaster
During the campaign, Joe Biden was a laughing stock, relegated to the safe, blue states where—Obama hoped—the press would ignore him. They did not.

No, wait. He is the dumbest man. And the whiniest. This is like listening to my kids complain about homework. Obama has no understanding of basic economics. He lacks any knowledge of the Great Depression. He seems to actually believe that the New Deal significantly reduced unemployment.

                The Constitution enumerates certain powers to the US government. Chief among them is national defense. Barack Obama, in his campaign and in his first two weeks as president, has demonstrated a callous disregard for that duty. His actions threaten to place Americans in grave danger. Safe Since September 11, 2001
Like many, I assumed that Islamofascist terrorists would strike the US within a month or two of 9/11. The reasons were obvious at the time: we were woefully unprepared, panicked, and confused.

Daschle’s Hubris
First, let’s set up some context. Here’s what your soon-to-be Health Socializer said about tax cheats on the floor of the Senate in 1998:

                Well, at least communism’s brightest symbol: piles of mattresses.
In this case, Obama’s politburo wants to buy and crush new cars and trucks. Yes, GM and Chrysler and Ford can produce all the cars and trucks they want. Since the public won’t buy them, the government will—and crush them. Crush them. I kid you not. This from Gateway Pundit:
Democrats want to include a new car crushing plan in the &amp;ldquo;stimulus&amp;rdquo; bill where the government would buy new cars and trucks that obtain less than 18 mpg and crush them

                The Democrat National Congressional Committee has launched an online petition calling forsanctamony directed at radio giant Rush Limbaugh. Why not me? I wrote &amp;quot; I, for one, hopehis presidency is a miserable failure but that the country somehow survives&amp;rdquo; before Limbaugh spoke similar sentiments. I started the Campaign to Hope Obama Fails; Rush is a Johnny-come-lately. A fair-weather fan. He&amp;rsquo;s probably a big Steeler fan all of a sudden, too. The next the Democrats feel the need to decry divisiveness, please send them to me.

                In 2005, I blogged about the fact that expert consensus is usually wrong. For instance:
 * More than half of the studies published in medical journals are later proven wrong. * Most experts predicted that oil prices would continue to rise to $200 a barrel as recently as last August, but gas prices have fallen more than 50 percent since. I based[ my prediction of oil in the $30s](https://hennessysview.com/2007/11/13/oil-price-collapse-coming/) on the simple fact that the experts agreed we&#39;d never see oil below $100.

                On Friday, US Premier Barack Hussein Obama tipped his hand on his plans of banning dissent. He told reporters that Republicans must “stop listening to Rush Limbaugh.”
Were Obama an ordinary politician, we’d take this comment as a harmless, oral wish. Limbaugh is an effective advocate for conservatism, limited government, lower taxes, freedom, and peace-through-strength—all things Obama hates.
Obama’s not a typical politician in the American sense; he’s a communist. He’s a totalitarian.

                Bill Clinton began his presidency in a recession, promising to make a middle class tax cut and more jobs his laser-beam focus. But first, he let gays into the military and sent his wife off to socialize medicine. Barack Obama began his presidency during a borderline depression, promising to save the country from economic collapse, lowering the seas, and scripting quality endings to Stephen King&amp;rsquo;s movies. But first, he symbolically flipped off everyone affected by Islamofascist terrorists,snubbed military heroes, andredifined ethics as the way one behaves when the whole world&amp;rsquo;s watching.

                One of Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s first actions as president will likely involve a series of executive orders ensuring that as many abortions as possible happen. Good government protects its most vulnerable citizens; bad government kills them. Nazi Germany killed the weak, the halt, the improvident. Of course, the Nazis trained specialist to carry out these grim and evil tasks. In America, we rely on ordinary citizens to do the killing for us.
