      <description>John is a Vietnam veteran and retired business executive. He loves America and hates to see what’s happened in Washington the past few years. He believes in liberty and Constitutional limitations on government growth.
He called the Tea Party just to vent and to see if it’s just him.
Recently, John had called Senator Kit Bond’s (R-MO) office in Washington. He wanted to know whether stories that Bond had signed off a $659 million earmark for soy bean farmers were true.</description>

      <title>Overwhelm the Nazis</title>

      <description>The American Nazis are holding a rally on the Arch grounds at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, April 18. The Anti-Defamation League is sponsoring a counter-rally in Forest Park at the same time.
I will be at Forest Park.
So I have some strong disagreements with some of the sponsoring organizations of the counter-rally. Big deal. If the point of the counter-rally is to oppose Nazism, then I can easily look past those differences for a couple of hours.</description>

      <description>I just checked my spam filter and found more than a dozen comments that were not spam. I have released them all.
I apologize to anyone who posted a comment that did not appear in a timely fashion. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to be more diligent about checking the filter.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I read somewhere that the sun&amp;rsquo;s getting hotter every year,&amp;rdquo; said Tom genially. &amp;ldquo;It seems that pretty soon the earth&amp;rsquo;s going to fall into the sun&amp;ndash;or wait a minute&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s just the opposite&amp;ndash;the sun&amp;rsquo;s getting colder every year.&amp;rdquo;

      <title>Apologies for Ill-informed Link</title>

      <description>Several weeks ago, I linked and blogged about an organization headquartered in St. Louis. I had never heard of it. The name of the outfit&amp;ndash;Council of Conservative Citizens&amp;ndash;sounded like something useful. After reading a few entries on the blog, I thought it sounded pretty good.
Today, though, I received their quarterly newsletter. I was a bit surprised by the number of stories about &amp;ldquo;blacks.&amp;rdquo; As I continued to read, it was obvious that the editors of the paper hold racial views that I have no desire to be associated with.</description>
