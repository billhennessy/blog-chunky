      <description>Donald Trump just had another one of those weeks for which he&amp;rsquo;s become famous.
 There was the week hit bombed Syria while dining with President Xi of China at Mar a Lago. There was Easter Week 2019 when the Mueller Report exonerated and the economy hit new highs. There was the week of the State of the Union Address that included his exoneration in the Senate.  But, this week&amp;rsquo;s outbreak of liberty and its commensurate exposure of Trump&amp;rsquo;s enemies as pure scum is the best so far.</description>

      <title>Did Andrew Cuomo Intentionally Kill the Elderly of New York?</title>

      <description>It would be the most sinister murder plot in US history. Imagine a governor conspiring to thin the population of elderly people, using a pandemic as both cover and weapon.
As unimaginable as it would be, evidence is mounting New York Governor Andrew Cuomo did just that: culled the herd in nursing homes by weaponizing Coronavirus.
Dumped Off With Their Own Body Bags New York Governor Andrew Cuomo implemented an emergency declaration that required nursing homes to accept active Coronavirus patients regardless of their ability to care for or isolate the infected patients.</description>

      <description>The leaked Five Eyes dossier on China&amp;rsquo;s nefarious Coronavirus pandemic provides all the pieces to figure out what happened and why. The dossier doesn&amp;rsquo;t connect the dots for you, but they&amp;rsquo;re now easy to connect. So easy, even I can do it. The story goes something like this.
 China was playing around with dangerous natural microbes in order to prove that it was as good as the USA at studying and neutralizing infectious diseases.</description>

      <description>The only thing more dangerous than a man with unlimited resources is a man with nothing to lose.
Thanks to tyrannical and unlawful restrictions on liberty and commerce by a few governors, mayors, and county executives, 30 million Americans have nothing left to lose except their dignity and freedom.
Millions of American feel threatened by stupid and tyrannical policies that have no basis in science or evidence. Only the will to power drives governors like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer.</description>

      <description>Agents of the FBI plotted to frame and destroy General James Flynn for politic purposes according to handwritten notes released today.
General Flynn, a 30-year Army veteran and 3-star General, pled guilty to false charges in order to protect his family from further harassment by the FBI in 2017.
Now, the law firm that once represented Flynn has release thousands of documents it previously illegally refused to turn over. One of those documents is a handwritten note.</description>

      <description>In the past 48 hours, the World Health Organization has spread misinformation about the Coronavirus intended to keep economies closed for good.
On Saturday, the WHO, through its propaganda tools like the New York Times, Twitter, Facebook, and CNN, released a statement that Coronavirus antibodies offered no protection against catching the disease a second time. This statement was factually wrong, but the media quickly broadcast the false statement.
On Sunday, after an outcry by physicians and researchers, the WHO amended its statement to say &amp;ldquo;there is no evidence&amp;rdquo; that Coronavirus antibodies protect people from the disease.</description>

      <description>Why would YouTube and Twitter executives attack an innovative biotech company?
Hatred. Pure, unadulterated hate.
Nothing but raging emotion can explain why both YouTube and Twitter went on the offensive against the biotech company AYTU Healight this weekend, banning the company from their platforms.
What AYTU Healight did to earn deplatforming: it found favor with the man the China-controlled World Health Organization hates.
Donald Trump merely asked his mecical experts about the possibilities of AYTU Healight&amp;rsquo;s Far-UVC catheter technology.</description>

      <description>The Congressional Budget Office release a report yesterday (April 24, 2020) that expects our response to Coronavirus will wipe out 40 percent of the US economy and throw 27 million Americans into long-term unemployment. We could see unemployment rates of 20 percent or more for a decade.
The Last Depression My parents were born in 1925. Their understanding of the world was shaped by the Great Depression and World War II.</description>

      <description>Governors, mayors, and county executives are drunk with power, and it&amp;rsquo;s our job to sober their asses up.
Thanks to Josh Schisler and the Reopen Missouri movement, protests are a comin&amp;rsquo;. We&amp;rsquo;re gonna pull good ol&amp;rsquo; fashioned 2009 on a new crop of autocrats in a two-part protest to get Missouri Working Again.
Part One: Reopen Missouri @ State Capitol at Noon Jefferson City, Missouri. Noon to 1:00 vehicle protest at the State Capitol.</description>

      <description>If you pay attention to certain sources, you&amp;rsquo;ll know exactly what to do. One of these sources is the Francis Vatican. Whatever the Francis Vatican says, do the opposite.
Francis&amp;rsquo; Vatican recently called China the best example of Christianity in the world. Thinking people immediately treated China like the incarnation of Satan, which it is.
When Francis defiled St. Peter&amp;rsquo;s Basilica with demonic idols, thinking Christians canceled their planned trip to the Vatican</description>

      <description>If I asked you, &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s the perfect act of love and humility?&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;d likely answer, &amp;ldquo;to give one&amp;rsquo;s life for his neighbor.&amp;rdquo;
If I asked your for the second greatest, you might say, &amp;ldquo;to sacrifice one&amp;rsquo;s life&amp;rsquo;s greatest work for his neighbor.&amp;rdquo;
Now, if I asked you, &amp;ldquo;what is Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s greatest work?&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;d probably say, &amp;ldquo;the US economy.&amp;rdquo;
Objectively, the incredible US economy since January 2017 is the greatest accomplishment in Trump&amp;rsquo;s life.</description>

      <description>Today, President Trump nailed it.
 âWhat we did was we closed everything down. That was our public health strategy. Just close everything, all businesses, old workers, young people, old people, short people, tall people. Every school closed, everything.â
  âIf you rethought that or had time to analyze that public health strategy, I don&amp;rsquo;t know that you would say quarantine everyone. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know that that was the best public health policy.</description>

      <description>Democrats are bent on plunging America into an economic depression. Democrats love misery.
While I&amp;rsquo;ve been in favor of &amp;ldquo;overreacting&amp;rdquo; to the coronavirus pandemic, we will have no choice but to simply return to status quo ante without immediate economic relief.
I urge President Trump to give 24 hours to pass the Republican Senate emergency relief bill. If it hasn&amp;rsquo;t passed, end the national emergency, rescind all disaster declarations declared on behalf of states, and order the DOJ and the National Guard to guarantee freedom of speech, movement, religion, and commerce in every state.</description>

      <description>If the world has listened to Trump in 2015, the coronavirus pandemic might have happened, but it would have been a lot less severe. I say this with absolutely no fear of error.
President Trump become an enemy of the left for just one policy proposal: controlling national borders. Trump not only wanted to restore US border controls that were left to decay since the 1960s, he also encouraged other nations to treat their borders like the front doors of their homes.</description>

      <description>The thing that most rankled the left and crony-capitalist &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; about Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s Magic Escalator Ride were his statements on illegal immigration. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re not sending their best.&amp;rdquo;
The left sees open borders as a means of finally reducing the United States to a pauper nation, a dream long shared by socialists and communists in the US and Europe.
Crony capitalists are less prosaic in their aims. They see open borders as a source of cheap labor.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been trained to believe newer is better and high tech beats analog. Nassim Taleb labeled this cognitive error neomania. Neomania is a pathological preference for the new over the old. Or preference of the untested over the proven. (Later, we will see an extended quote from Taleb&amp;rsquo;s awesome book Antrfragile which explains the value of the proven.)
Iowa Democrats tried to use the latest neomanic technology for their caucuses. It was an Obamacare.</description>

      <description>They say that time heals all wounds. But some wounds don&amp;rsquo;t heal. They fester and metastasize until pain demands the intervention of a surgeon&amp;rsquo;s scalpel.
Two years have passed since Eric Greitens was carried from the Missouri Governor&amp;rsquo;s Mansion by a toxic cocktail of lies, false allegations, and prosecutorial misconduct.
For two years, Missouri&amp;rsquo;s media and establishment Republicans pretended it never happened. They never liked Greitens, and they wanted him to go away.</description>

      <description>Last week, the Missouri Ethics Commission fined former Governor Eric Greitens for nothing. Literally, they fined him for doing nothing wrong.
Even CNN finds the Missour Ethics Commission unethical and repulsive:
 A Missouri panel &amp;ldquo;found no evidence of any wrongdoing&amp;rdquo; by former Gov. Eric Greitens following a nearly 18-month investigation into allegations of misconduct by his 2016 gubernatorial campaign, according to a report released Thursday (CNN)
 Political pressure from the current Missouri governor undoubtedly weighed on the MEC.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard that the Democrat Iowa Caucuses were a humiliating and laugh-out-loud disaster. Apparently, the same idiots who built the Obamacare website (aka Harvard) also built a voting app for the caucuses. Like Obamacare, the app didn&amp;rsquo;t work. At least, that&amp;rsquo;s the official story.
But it&amp;rsquo;s never uncharitble to presume the Democrats are cheating. Because Democrats are cheaters by nature and practice.
The nightmare scenario for Democrats is Bernie Sanders.</description>

      <description>What is &amp;ldquo;rent-seeking?&amp;rdquo;
Here&amp;rsquo; a brief description from David John Marotta, What Is Rent-Seeking Behavior in Forbes
 Rent-seeking doesn&amp;rsquo;t add any national value. It is coerced trade and benefits only one side. Rent-seeking can include piracy, lobbying the government or even just giving away money.
 There are two kinds of lobbyists.
One kind of lobbyist is necessary to keep legislators and executive-branch bureaucrats informed and on notice. These lobbyists protect the interests of special interest group, but often their special interest needs protection because it is at the mercy of the government.</description>

 When the media, crooked businessmen, and corrupt politicians were in the midst of their coup against Eric Greitens, a friend told me, &amp;ldquo;If they get rid of Greitens, Parson will sell everything that isn&amp;rsquo;t nailed down.&amp;rdquo;
My friend was wrong. Governor Mike Parson (who may or may not have been a conspirator in the coup) is selling everything in Missouri, but he isn&amp;rsquo;t stopping at the loose items.</description>

      <description>IG Report: Obama Out-Dicked Nixon
Nixon resigned. He resigned after a half-dozen Republican Senators told him, in the Oval Office, that a majority of Senators would vote to remove him from office if the House impeached him.
So Nixon resigned.
Nixon&amp;rsquo;s crimes were limited to covering up a break-in and wiretapping by employees of his re-election committee.
Baraka Obama did worse. And he got by.
Obama out-dicked Nixon.
The IG Report Department of Justice Inspector-General Michael Horowitz released his report on Monday.</description>

(This will be very short.)
The conservative tide continues. People around the world are fed up with the failed ideas of the 1960s and 1970s. Maybe it was nostalgia that drove world leaders to dig up all the political crap I remember from my childhood. It failed then, and it&amp;rsquo;s failing us now.</description>

      <description>You can deplatform Twitter and damage their business model. You don&amp;rsquo;t need money or special skills or lawyers. But deplatforming Twitter requires two things:
 Commitment. Friends.  Friends can be strangers, as long as they use Twitter. Twitter followers are perfect friends for this action.
What Is &amp;ldquo;Deplatforming&amp;rdquo; and Why Should We Do It? Deplatforming is one of these new words that irritate me. But new words have the virtue of universality.</description>

      <description>A friend commented on a recent blog of mine that he misses my political analysis. So I need to make this clear: my political analysis is that all problems in the world are demonic in nature.
I&amp;rsquo;ll write that again so no one&amp;rsquo;s confused: all problems, including all political problems, are demonic. Stop inviting Satan and the demons out of the abyss God made for them, and problems go away.</description>

      <title>The Mueller Prophecy</title>

      <description>Friends,
Let me begin by saying &amp;ldquo;I am sorry&amp;rdquo; to Robert Mueller and his family.
I have been critical of Mr. Mueller and his sham &amp;ldquo;investigation.&amp;rdquo; I have been uncharitable to him. And I am sorry.
It became clear today that Mr. Mueller wasn&amp;rsquo;t a hostile actor. Obviously, Mueller is seriously impaired. What we saw in his selection of lawyers, in his handling of the investigation, in his management of partisan and criminal conduct by senior Justice Department officials under his command resulted not from malice toward the president but from incompetence.</description>

      <description>For a few weeks in June and July, Nancy Pelosi was doing a good job of isolating the Hate Squad. Pelosi realizes that the Hate Squad is bad for Democrats. She saw the Hate Squad growing in media attention, and she worked hard to stop that trend.
Then, like a genius, Donald Trump did what Trump does best: he stuck out his chin to let his opponent (Pelosi) punch herself out.</description>

      <description>New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman today asked a rhetorical question: Trump&amp;rsquo;s Going to Get Re-elected, Isn&amp;rsquo;t He?
The headline reflects the question he hears from his Democrat friends. They seem resigned to defeat. And the answer is: Yes. President Trump will win re-election in 2020.
The reasons Trump will get re-elected:
  The Hate Squad. Four radical communist freshmen Representatives are the face of the new Democrat party. They are anti-Semitic, anti-Christian, and anti-American.</description>

Rex left St. Louis and became a billionaire by inventing stock market indexing or something. I went the Navy and still thank God every day that I have roof over my head.

      <description>Just a quick warning. On break from Lenten retreat, but this is bugging me.
Many conservatives are celebrating the Mueller report even though they have no idea what it says.
That&amp;rsquo;s dangerous, as I pointed out in my post on loving Rachel Maddow:
 Finally, we still donât know the details of the Mueller report. It could contain information that sends conservatives to Twitter to express our rage and anger. We donât know.</description>

Snowstorm Humanitarian Crisis on I-44 Last night, hundreds of people (maybe thousands) were trapped in their cars on I-44 eastbound near Eureka, Missouri for 7, 9, 12 hours. Some even longer. According to police scanners, a baby was born on the highway. It was a humanitarian crisis.
Now, St. Louis billionaire Rex Sinquefield wants to make every aspect of your St. Louis County life a humanitarian crisis.</description>

Retire that wicked witch of the swamp McCaskill so you can walk with a little pride, Missouri.Â I am 100% voting proudly for Josh Hawley for US Senate, and you will too.Â No need to say more. Vote for Hawley all the way and silently wonder what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t. (There&amp;rsquo;s something wrong. Say a prayer for them.)

 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.

      <description>Even his supporters say President Trump&amp;rsquo;s speech is sometimes inelegant. Intentional or accidental, the president&amp;rsquo;s word choice often triggers his enemies and sometimes confuses his many supporters. But on Friday President Trump had the best words for sure.
Talking about the possibility of Democrats seizing control of the US House of Representatives, he said, &amp;ldquo;could happen . . . could happen.&amp;rdquo;
But the killer line we all must remember came next: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it.</description>

      <description>WARNING: College-educated suburban women should not read this article because it will punch holes in their unicorn-and-rainbows delusions.
Democrats use refugees like pawns in their perverted and wicked quest for power.
Once upon a time, nearly all asylum seekers were turned away by the United States. These were times when Democrats ran the White House or both Houses of Congress.
Most recently, the Obama administration banned all asylum seekers from Cuba.</description>

      <description>If you read a lot of business and personal improvement blogs, you know they feed a lot of tips for living a better life. By &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; they mean making more money, getting a promotion, being more productive, whatever.
Are those things really what makes life better? If so, why do so many successful people burn out? John Belushi, River Phoenix, Amy Winehouse, Janice Joplin, Michael Jackson. Is it show business? Well, look what&amp;rsquo;s happening to Elon Musk.</description>

      <description>Amendment 1 would turn over Missouri&amp;rsquo;s state and federal gerrymandering to an unelected demographer. This means there&amp;rsquo;s an 8 to 1 chance (87.5%) that the demographer will be a Democrat.Â Demography is a social science.Â Social science majors are mostly far left or liberal. Only a handful of social science majors call themselves conservative:
 A 2015 study by psychologist JosÃ© Duarte, then at Arizona State University, and his colleagues inÂ Behavioral and Brain Sciences, entitled âPolitical Diversity Will Improve Social Psychological Science,â found that 58 to 66 percent of social scientists are liberal and only 5 to 8 percent conservative and that there are eight Democrats for every Republican.</description>

What went wrong?Â I underestimated the courage and fortitude of three Senators: Republicans Jeff Flake and Susan Collins, and Democrat &amp;ldquo;Lonely&amp;rdquo; Joe Manchin.Â I truly believed Flake would put his hatred of Donald Trump before the good of the country and vote nay.</description>

      <description>A faction in America seems hellbent on destroying the country in order to save it from Donald Trump. What do we owe them?
For many years, I wrote and preached that we owe them contempt and anger. That we must fight them tooth and nail. And that we must prevail.
And we did. And our victories led to bigger battles. The thrill of victory proved fleeting.

      <description>Dottie Bailey defeated Rockwood School Board President Matt Doell in the Republican primary for Missouri House District 110. Dottie now faces Democrat Cody Kelley in November.
Dottie is a phenomenal campaigner. She knocked on over 4,000 doors between April and August. Her efforts resulted in an enormous 19 percentage-point win despite being outspent by her opponent. Making Dottie&amp;rsquo;s more impressive is the fact that Doell had been elected to the Rockwood board three times while this was Dottie&amp;rsquo;s first race ever.</description>

      <description>You made it.Â If you began the Fast with me, today is the last day of skipping breakfast and lunch. (Unless you decide to makeone-meal-a-day a permanent habit.)
What Fasting Can Do Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened to you during the fast (if you followed the prescription):
 You probably lost about five pounds. Your pants feel looser. You pull your belt a notch tighter. You saved money. (I saved $98.)Â  You learned that food is an option most of the time.</description>

      <description>We need poll sitters. Poll workers for Dottie Bailey for Missouri House District 110. Eureka, Pacific, and Wildwood.
The job is easy. Wear a Dottie Bailey t-shirt in front of a polling place. As voters approach, say &amp;ldquo;Thank you for coming out to vote today, and we appreciateÂ your support for Dottie Bailey.
Why Dottie Dottie is the true conservative, grassroots activist in the race. Her primary opponent is an old nemesis of the Tea Party.</description>

      <description>Matt Doell pretending to be a Republican is the greatest display of cross-dressing since the Broadway premiere of La Cage Aux Folles.1
If you live in Missouri House district 110 (Eureka, Pacific, Wildwood), Matt Doell has been molesting your mailbox with personal attacks on his opponent, Dottie Bailey. (Read voter reactions to Doell&amp;rsquo;s dirt campaign here and here.)
You might have noticed that Doell (I call him Droopy) never attacks Dottie&amp;rsquo;s positions on issues like jobs, education, the Second Amendment, taxes, crime, etc.</description>

      <description>Personally, I like Jeff Roe, the political consultant.
He called me the night before Ted Cruz announced his run for president. I was honored, frankly. As Senator Cruz&amp;rsquo;s campaign manager, Mr. Roe had much bigger fish to fry that night. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that Jeff holds no grudges. He genuinely cares about the opposing candidates even while he viciously destroys their careers. I have no doubt Mr. Roe has many great qualities as a person, and I know he has amazing talents as aÂ political operative and strategist.</description>

Voters in House District 110 are asking why they received such a &amp;ldquo;disgusting&amp;rdquo; flyer from candidate Matt Doell.
Answer: Probably because he&amp;rsquo;s losing badly.
Matt Doell has decided to get dirty. And personal. And mean. (Horrible internals?)
While Dottie Bailey has knocked doors, attended coffees, and generally met with voters, Matt Doell rubbed elbows with hot-shots and union bosses and avoided anything that looks like an &amp;ldquo;ordinary person.</description>

      <description>Matt Doell made a desperate attempt to sick the MEC on Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View. Makes me so happy.
But the MEC shot Doell down like a hovering duck.
From the MEC&amp;rsquo;s official &amp;ldquo;Wah-wah&amp;rdquo; letter to the Doell campaign:
 Therefore, the Commission is not accepting this complaint.
 Doell&amp;rsquo;s failed complaint centers on my blog posts that criticize his performance as a member of the Rockwood School Board. For your convenience, here&amp;rsquo;s the list of my blogs criticizing Rockwood during Doell&amp;rsquo;s seven-year tenure:</description>

      <description>Everyone remembers the horrible audit of the Rockwood School District.
** $1.2 million wasted in double payments ** Contracts awarded to a construction company that had one of its executives on the board ** Feeble, &amp;ldquo;arrogant&amp;rdquo; response to the audit from board members ** Bad management!
But the worst example of cronyism and arrogance went largely unreported. (The great Elliott Davis caught it, though. Video to follow.)
Rockwood Board&amp;rsquo;s Secret Response The late auditor Tom Schweich released Rockwood&amp;rsquo;s horrible audit on February 28, 2013.</description>

      <description>Many years ago, a company hired a new president.
After several months on the job, this new president learned that most of his employees couldn&amp;rsquo;t pick him out of a line-up. He spent so much time in his office or in meetings or traveling that he rarely met with the people who reported to him.
To fix this problem, he set up a series of lunches. They were off-site at restaurants around town.</description>

      <description>One of the candidates for Missouri House District 110 (Eureka, Wildwood, and Pacific) sent out a mailer to voters today.Â The mailer talks about &amp;ldquo;local control&amp;rdquo; of education, and many other fine platitudes that poll well.Â In other news,** while this candidate was on the Rockwood School District board of directors** (the district that serves most of Eureka, Wildwood, and Pacific), **bad things happened**.

      <description>I invite you to join a centuries-old tradition: fasting for a cause.Â Moses and Jesus fasted for 40 days. But this Primary Fast will last only 14.Â Some fasts require that you eat nothing during the fast. But this Primary Fast lets you eat one full, wonderful meal a day. Did you know that General Stanley McChrystal has lived on just one meal a day for decades. And one meal a day was enough to drive him through the war against al Qaeda.</description>

      <description>One of the candidates running for the state House of Representatives in District 110 has been on the Rockwood School Board since 2011.Â In a campaign mailer, this candidate claims he&amp;rsquo;s cut taxes in the district. Is that true?
Well, it&amp;rsquo;s true that the property tax rate in Rockwood has been reduced twice during his tenure. But that&amp;rsquo;s not even close to the whole picture.Â Since the 2010-2011 school year, when this candidate joined the board, Rockwood has raised taxes 5 times.</description>

back in high school

Make you look like a fool boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
but all he kept talking about was Glory Days

&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s this Faughn guy&amp;rsquo;s role in the Greitens&amp;rsquo; investigation?&amp;rdquo; someone asked.
Faughn is the publisher of Missouri Times and a former mayor of Poplar Bluff, Missouri. Papers call him a &amp;ldquo;power broker.&amp;rdquo; Others call him the &amp;ldquo;Candy Man.&amp;rdquo;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the question. &amp;ldquo;Not sure,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;His paper hates Grietens, but that&amp;rsquo;s as much as know. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been to his weird, hidden party pad in Jefferson City.</description>

Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve answered, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the limits of data science in 2018.
The best data scientists in the world agreed with nearly absolute certainty. These scientists determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hillary Clinton would be the 45th President of the United States. That was in 2016.

In the 1980s, leftist professors, leftist news media, and leftist entertainers were angry. For years, they&amp;rsquo;d preached that Ronald Reagan was a neo-Nazi buffoon whose incompetence and malice would destroy America. Maybe even wipe out the human species. &amp;ldquo;I believe Ronald Reagan can turn America back into what it once was,&amp;rdquo; said comedian Steve Martin on Saturday Night Live in 1980, &amp;ldquo;a vast wasteland covered with ice.</description>

      <description>Forgive me. I say &amp;ldquo;liberal&amp;rdquo; sometimes when I mean something else.
My mistake is habit, not irony. (Irony would require some intent on my part.)
I grew up disparaging liberalism. I grew up reading and watching William F. Buckley Jr., for whom liberalism was the enemy.
In the post-WWII era, the liberalism of the day was a problem. But it was neverÂ the problem.
The problem in Western Civilization was a faction that used liberalism as cover.</description>

Nancy Pelosi, former swimsuit model, laughing at The Donald&amp;rsquo;s off-color jokes. About Mitch McConnell. Or Paul Ryan. While Chuck fills color of his own, about deals he helped The Donald put together back in New York. Stuff that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it intoÂ The Art of the Deal orÂ The Art of the Comeback.</description>

      <description>Eight months into the Trump Administration, one cabinet appointment stands out as a flop: Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
 We all had a lot of hope. Back in January. Hope.
Hope for the Trump administration. Hope for American greatness. And hope for justice. If you&amp;rsquo;re a Tea Partier, you had a lot of hope.
Jeff Sessions looked like the ultimate pick for Attorney General. Conservatives berated Mitch McConnell to accelerate Sessions&amp;rsquo; confirmation by the Senate.</description>

      <description>Many people say, &amp;ldquo;you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t punish children for sins of the parent.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s something we firmly believe as Americans. The US Constitution even prohibits &amp;ldquo;corruption of blood.&amp;rdquo; Corruption of blood refers to laws that pass guilt genetically from generation to generation.
I think we can all agree that punishing children for their parents&amp;rsquo; crimes is un-American. But what about children whoÂ profit from their parents&amp;rsquo; crimes? Should they be allowed to keep the booty?</description>

      <title>Paul Ryan&#39;s Spokesperson Renounces Support for Antifa</title>

      <description>It was probably a coincidence.
One day after Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View reported Speaker Paul &amp;ldquo;Dumbbell&amp;rdquo; Ryan as a member of the Antifa caliphate support team, Speaker Ryan&amp;rsquo;s office renounced his membership in the terrorist group&amp;rsquo;s fan club.

As reported by The Gateway Pundit:
 Social media was set ablaze after Paul Ryan attacked President Trump for condemning âboth sidesâ for the violence in Charlottesville. Trump supporters hammered Paul Ryan for refusing to condemn Antifa.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I explained the military strategy behind Antifa&amp;rsquo;s remarkable growth.
In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it, Antifa has effectively shut down grass roots conservative speech. You cannot hold a public rally, march, or carnival if your views conflict with Antifa&amp;rsquo;s.
Antifa has established a small caliphate in North America. Just like ISIS did in Syria and Iraq.
And the government&amp;rsquo;s doing absolutely nothing about it. You should read my military strategy post and all the links.</description>

      <description>If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal, we can flee from him.
    If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.</description>

      <description>You know this blog rarely criticizes President Trump. There&amp;rsquo;s a simple reason for that. That reason is the thousands of fraudulent journalists who create and repeat lies about President Trump every day. Like Jake &amp;ldquo;The Fake&amp;rdquo; Tapper. Those fake journalists don&amp;rsquo;t need my help.
You also know that I have criticized President Bush, Republican candidates for president, and many, many other Republicans and conservatives. I just adopted a simple rule last year: until the fake news media treats President Trump honestly and fairly, I won&amp;rsquo;t criticize my president.</description>

      <description>Elections have consequences.
One consequence that we&amp;rsquo;ve all experienced: when you elect a street fighter, you get street fights.
Another consequence that terrorists are experiencing: when you elect a street-fighter patriot, terrorists die.
President Trump tonight reminded so many of us why we elected him. Because he&amp;rsquo;s a street fighter. Because he&amp;rsquo;s a patriot. Because there are bad people who wish us harm, and Donald Trump is okay with killing them.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s easy to say, &amp;ldquo;I hate racists and Nazis. I&amp;rsquo;m glad somebody&amp;rsquo;s taking the initiative and beating them with clubs.&amp;rdquo;
Many people feel that way. Many people feel it&amp;rsquo;s good and just to beat and maim wicked people. Especially people who hold wicked beliefs.</description>

      <description>Angry texts.
I got a bunch of very angry texts this morning.
My friends are fired up. Because of Governor Greitens&amp;rsquo;s executive order. **An executive order that implements a novel approach to prescription drug databases.Â **
In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, Governor Greitens signed an executive order on July 17. The EO made Missouri the 50th state to establish some sort of prescription drug tracking.
Most states track everything about prescriptions.</description>

News broke this weekend that Kid Rock is LEADING challenger, Dem Debbie Stabenow in a new pollÂ 30% to 26%! Everyone who wrote this off as a joke, then as a publicity stunt, then asÂ impossible, then asÂ improbable will be forced to say &amp;ldquo;Senator Rock&amp;rdquo; soon. Very soon.

They worry about this trend toward &amp;ldquo;unserious&amp;rdquo; politicians getting elected.
They worry about &amp;ldquo;what it says about voters&amp;rdquo; who elect Sarah Palin, Donald Trump, and (very soon) Kid Rock.

If we take attack North Korea militarily, over a million South Koreans will die. Along with a lot of Americans on ships and on land over there. Nobody wants that. It might come to that, but nobody wants it.
Now, North Korea has ICBMs that can drop a nuke on Alaska.</description>

The budget is horrible. Republicans are spinning a few &amp;ldquo;wins&amp;rdquo; in the budget, but that&amp;rsquo;s a terrible argument. It&amp;rsquo;s like telling a terminal cancer patient, &amp;ldquo;but your blood pressure&amp;rsquo;s pretty good.&amp;rdquo;

Pretty soon, you&amp;rsquo;d stop leaving those kids to their own devices, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you? If you had to leave town, you&amp;rsquo;d find a sitter. Maybe a retired Marine uncle. Or a friendly cop to send a car by the house every half hour during the dark hours.</description>

Instead of going to tax reform next, President Trump should work on that big-league infrastructure bill. Now. Fast.
President Trump needs a big win because power is in perception. He also needs to put Democrats in a bind. Plus, he needs to prove he can pass big legislation without all GOP factions on board.
The solution is infrastructure.
During the campaign, Trump spoke of a massive building project to rejuvenate our roads, modernize our airports, and more.</description>

That same thing happened to Obamacare over the years. It&amp;rsquo;s now untouchable.
** Obamacare survived the election of Scott Brown in Massachusetts. So it was born in a toxic environment. ** Then, Obamacare survived two Supreme Court rulings, each time by a single vote from the chief justice. ** Finally, Obamacare survived seven years of Republican promises to repeal it immediately upon winning the White House and Congress.</description>

      <description>General George S. Patton arrived in North Africa with a single mission: lead the Allied forces to victory over the Hun.
But Patton&amp;rsquo;s assignment was also in response to a miserable and deadly failure of leadership. The failed leadership of General Lloyd Fredendall.
 Fredendall was a Francophobe and an Anglophobe ill-suited to wage coalition warfare; a micromanager who bypassed the chain of command â giving orders as far down as company level; a coward, he allowed animus with subordinates to affect his judgment and undercut their authority; and finally, staring defeat in the face at Kasserine, he tried to pin the blame on others.</description>

      <description>Today, President Trump changed the game. He changed the Prisoner&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma (coordination) into a game of Chicken (competition).
Lifer Republicans have no experience with games of chicken. They were raised on coordination games.
By changing the game to Chicken, Donald Trump greatly increased the chances that phony Paul Ryan&amp;rsquo;s healthcare will PASS.
Here&amp;rsquo;s why briefly.
Psychologically, people always think they have more time. Republicans, in particular, believe time is limitless. Lifelong Republicans think they can delay any decision until the decision they want is a given.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump delivered his budget and a message for Congress.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m lazy, I&amp;rsquo;ll quote Time magazine.
First, the President&amp;rsquo;s message to Congress:
 &amp;ldquo;I urge the members of Congress to remember that last November the American people&amp;rsquo;s message was loud and clear. The mandate for change, expressed by the American people, was not my mandate; it was our mandate.&amp;rdquo;
 Then, the analysis:
 The President&amp;rsquo;s meaning was unmistakable: the public wants deep cuts in both spending and taxes, and any legislator who tries to keep the ax from falling risks putting his own neck under an ax at the polls.</description>

      <title>BACKFIRE: Psychological Tricks Used to Advance Russian Conspiracy Theory</title>

      <description>Newspapers lie. And by &amp;ldquo;newspapers,&amp;rdquo; I mean the whole mainstream media.
Yesterday I told you how Donald Trump punked the media by pulling a Crazy Ivan maneuver. A critic on Twitter thinks I&amp;rsquo;m lying. He thinks I&amp;rsquo;m lying because he read a news article. He read it in the New York Times.
This Twitter critic thinks it&amp;rsquo;s okay for the New York Times to lie (&amp;ldquo;Wiretapped Data Used In Inquiry of Trump Aides&amp;rdquo;), as long as they only lie in their headlines.</description>

      <description>Cold War submarine lore. I can&amp;rsquo;t go into all of it here, but I can tell you about one bit of that lore: the Crazy Ivan.
Modern submarines have incredible passive sonar arrays. They can hear everything in the ocean for hundreds of miles around. Everything.
Everything except something directly behind them. Behind a submarine is a big propeller or &amp;ldquo;screw.&amp;rdquo; It turns. It pushes water abaft. The noise and the motion combine to prevent sound waves from reaching the sensors.</description>

      <description>You had to laugh. Claire McCaskill jumped on Twitter to announce she&amp;rsquo;d never met the Russian ambassador to the US. Before that, she jumped on Twitter to brag about being so damned important and vital that the Russian ambassador sought her oracle-like guidance.
After people mocked and scorned her silly lie, Claire McCaskill made up more lies to cover the first lie. You know, like a liar.
Senator McCaskill believes Jeff Sessions should resign for not telling a lie.</description>

      <description>Have you ever found yourself in the midst of a riot? Even if youâve only seen riots on television, you can probably imagine how it feels to be inside one.
Imagine yourself surrounded on all sides by angry faces dressed in shabby clothes, some faces covered with bandanas or ski masks. People are chanting something you can&amp;rsquo;t quite understand,Â like a private joke you&amp;rsquo;re not allowed to get. Or maybe they&amp;rsquo;re chanting at you.</description>

      <description>Trump&amp;rsquo;s enemies took refuge in the self-created narrative that his campaign was 100% American showmanship. The crooked press and the corrupt establishment, while dissing Trump publicly, scoffed privately. They &amp;ldquo;knew&amp;rdquo; his supporters were idiots and yahoosâmarginally functional Neanderthals from America&amp;rsquo;s unreconstructed backwoods whose ability to think, handicapped by genetics, was further crippled by the moonshine distilled in the shed behind their putrid outhouse for personal consumption by their incest-ridden family of knuckle-dragging racist homophobes.</description>

      <description>A lot of well-connected St. Louis Democrats like to say &amp;ldquo;everything&amp;rsquo;s fine&amp;rdquo; with the city and the St. Louis region. You know, though, that St. Louis is a mess. A hot, simmering mess covered with rot. (Check out StLouisPatina&amp;rsquo;s photo essay of St. Louis decay.) But the people responsible for St. Louis&amp;rsquo;s decay want you to pretend there are no problems. Of course, they do.
And it&amp;rsquo;s getting worse. You might find yourself wondering how bad things are in St.</description>

      <description>Jim Durbin called me this evening. &amp;ldquo;Are you excited?&amp;rdquo; he asked.
Jim was in the crowd at the very first Tea Party in St. Louis, February 27, 2009. A cold Friday. He and more than a thousand other folks took off work and school to see what this protest was all about. Like so many others, Jim knew America needed a change. A big one. A change built on the hopes and dreams and fierce independence of ordinary people.</description>

      <description>How will history remember the Tea Party movement of 2009 to 2016? The answer to that question depends on what we do next.
The Tea Party movement was an antagonistic movement. We opposed bad stuff. We sought punishment for bad actors. We saw that the experts were wrong, and we pointed out their folly. Like William F. Buckley&amp;rsquo;s charter for National Review, we stood athwart history, yelling &amp;ldquo;STOP!&amp;rdquo; At its heart, the Tea Party movement opposed a corrupt and insulated establishment class.</description>

      <description>Jill Stein has raised nearly $7 million in an effort to overturn election results in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. She has no chance of winning any of those states, and Hillary Clinton has joined Team Stein.
So what&amp;rsquo;s the point?
Apparently,Stein and Clinton want the recounts to miss their December 19 deadline. December 19 is the Constitutionally mandated Electoral College vote. If the recounts are incomplete on the 19th, voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania will be disenfranchised, no candidate will have 270 electoral votes, and the election will be thrown to the US House of Representatives.</description>

      <description>Every Constitutional conservative knows there&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as &amp;ldquo;states&amp;rsquo; rights.&amp;rdquo; Only people have rights. Governments have powers. People have the right to grant government powers. Governments have no power to assume powers not granted by the people. Anyone who says &amp;ldquo;states&amp;rsquo; rights&amp;rdquo; needs a basic course in political philosophy.
For years, a few conservatives mistakenly defended &amp;ldquo;states&amp;rsquo; rights&amp;rdquo; when they meant to say &amp;ldquo;federalism.&amp;rdquo; When conservatives made this error, the left jumped all over them.</description>

And the anti-trumpets better change. Fast. Or there will be hell to pay.
People will put up with harassment and violence only so long.

      <description>Guest Post by Lee A. Presser
My friend Bill Hennessy wrote an excellent 11-12-16 blog analysis of Anglo-American history and how it relates to Mr. Trumpâs victory (https://hennessysview.com/2016/11/12/how-the-second-born-twin-can-be-older-than-the-first/).Â After reading that blog I phoned him to add a tangential thought.Â Bill suggested I share the thought with you.
It took 561 years (from the Magna Carta to the Declaration of Independence) for the idea of limited government and political equality to infuse itself into Anglo-American culture.</description>

      <description>Have you ever noticed that twins have a pecking order? Even identical twins born minutes apart show a subtle seniority complex. Usually the first-born twin leads the second-born.
Makes you wonder how these Peterson twins will relate to each other, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?
Because of the time change at the end of daylight saving time, the second-born twin is officially older than the first. That&amp;rsquo;ll be interesting to watch. And if you find yourself pondering the oddness of those twins&amp;rsquo; birth order, you can easily find yourself pondering America&amp;rsquo;s little sister relationship to the UK.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I forget what originally drove me to call for a tea party protest in St. Louis.
One motivation was fear of missing out because a dozen other cities were planning protests. Another driver was a desire change the direction of the country. And at least some of it was the frustrated actor in me looking for an outlet.
Since two-thirds of those motivations appeal only to me, letâs focus on the middle one: change the country.</description>

But my friends opened my eyes.

      <description>You might be stressing out when you learn that James Comey sent another letter to Congress. In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t hear, he did. And he said that the emails found on Huma Abedin&amp;rsquo;s computer did not change his earlier conclusion about Hillary Clinton.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to panic or get mad or dejected. Totally understandable. But that&amp;rsquo;s totally counterproductive, too. And being mad or acting dispirited is just what the elites want us to do.</description>

If an athlete you despise makes a horrible error but the hated team he plays for wins the championship, how do you feel?
In several races across Missouri, some people seem willing to lose the war if it means they can win their private battles. Thatâs pretty sad, isnât it?</description>

Remember August 2015? It was hot, of course, but everybody was talking about when Trump would fade. For example, here&amp;rsquo;s the RCP Afternoon Edition from August 7, the day after the first GOP debate:
 Whose Party Is It, Anyway? - Molly Ball, The Atlantic The Republican Debate Was Awesome - David Harsanyi, The Federalist You Cannot Embarrass Donald Trump - Ezra Klein, Vox The Beginning of the End for Trump - Ed Rogers, Washington Post Martin O&amp;rsquo;Malley, the Dems&amp;rsquo; Fallback?</description>

A lot of people thought I was nuts, that I was reading too much into the White House statement that discredited Hillary&amp;rsquo;s primary talking point aboutÂ James Comey.
But today the Gateway Pundit reports that Michelle Obama has scrubbed all references** to Hillary Clinton from both of her Twitter timelines**.</description>

      <description>Since its revelation in WikiLeaks two weeks ago, Donna Brazile has been justly excoriated for cheating on behalf of Hillary Clinton by passing along a debate question.
However, an important aspect to this story has been overlooked. As the saying goes, it takes two to tango. Yes, Donna Brazile sent a critically beneficial piece of information - but Hillary Clinton accepted it.
Mrs. Clinton accepted it (stealing), used it (cheating), and said nothing (lying).</description>

Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s on a weekend trip. Or, God forbid, when you move in together. Then you realize looks aren&amp;rsquo;t everything.
The same thing can happen in political &amp;ldquo;marriages.&amp;rdquo; That surface quality that attracted youâdonors, influence, contacts, whateverâsometimes isn&amp;rsquo;t worth the price.

      <description>You never expect a candidate&amp;rsquo;s surrogates to tell you their candidate is a crook. But that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what Hillary&amp;rsquo;s surrogates are telling you now.
From Bill Richardson to Robby Mook, Clinton surrogates are reciting a strange and disturbing talking point: Voters have &amp;ldquo;baked in&amp;rdquo; Clinton&amp;rsquo;s life of crime.
[FLASHBACK: I gave James Comey the benefit of the doubt in July]
The talking point seems meant to keep Democrats from panicking over theÂ FBI&amp;rsquo;s re-opened criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.</description>

      <description>Everyone knows that the White House is interfering with the FBI&amp;rsquo;s investigation of Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s criminal conspiracies. We know this because the Justice Department is stonewalling the FBI&amp;rsquo;s request for a warrant to search the hard drive Huma Abedin shared with her ex-husband Anthony Weiner.
For those of us too young to remember those black-and-white days of Watergate, here&amp;rsquo;s a brief timeline via Watergate.info:

      <description>As I pointed out last Saturday, a tiny faction of Missouri conservatives prefers Missouri&amp;rsquo;s pathetic status quo to true leadership and positive change. Those people apparently approve of Missouri&amp;rsquo;s horrible economy, weak schools, and declining stature in the country. And nowhere does Missouri&amp;rsquo;s decline stand out like San Diego, California.
Last week, I spent a few days bumming around San Diego with my son. He is stationed there in the US Navy.</description>

      <description>My phone was vibrating like a like a sex toy all afternoon. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t look. I was with a client and teammates working on serious business.
When I got a break, after the client left, I locked myself in a bathroom stall and looked at the messages.
 Comey is reopening Hillary investigation
 New emails have been found
I didn&amp;rsquo;t believe it, so I looked at The Gateway Pundit:</description>

Donna Brazile colluded with Hillary&amp;rsquo;s campaign and Roland Martin to feed debate to questions to Hillary before a debate.
Hillary personally ordered violent protesters to disrupt Trump events.
Hillary, Brazile, and PACS broke the law by colluding on disrupting Trump events.
Hillary Clinton trashed and intimidated the women her husband raped.
Hillary Clinton stole classified material and her minions offered bribes the FBI to help cover up the crimes.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s play a little thought experiment.
Suppose you read that a scientific study proved dark blue socks look best with a gray suit. Then someone known for his remarkable sense of style shows up wearing purple striped socks with a gray suit. What would you do?
Before you answer that, consider this.
You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard that a handful of conservative activists are supporting the Democrat running for governor. Those misguided conservatives think the GOP nominee isn&amp;rsquo;t conservative enough.</description>

      <title>Democrats Rig Every Election</title>

      <description>Donald Trump is taking exactly the right approach on the upcoming rigged election.
Every election since 1960 has involved massive election rigging by Democrats. They laugh about it privately and act all offended by the accusation in public.
Republicans let it happen. Republicans like John McCain believe they have a &amp;ldquo;duty&amp;rdquo; to concede even if an election is rigged. They called &amp;ldquo;honorable.&amp;rdquo; But conceding a rigged election is actually a moral failing.</description>

      <description>Some people on the right say they won&amp;rsquo;t vote for Trump. Those people list various reasons, mostly about his demeanor and things he&amp;rsquo;s said in the past. They think who gets the credit is more important than what gets done. We all know people like that, don&amp;rsquo;t we?
Most of those NeverTrumpers were okay with Trump&amp;rsquo;s policies. They all love his Supreme Court list. Most of them liked Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s ideas, and Cruz&amp;rsquo;s weren&amp;rsquo;t far from Trump&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Outcomes.
NeverTrumpers seem to believe that the act of voting is a sort of magic spell that can right all past wrongs. Psychologists call this &amp;ldquo;magical thinking.&amp;rdquo; Children do it. Magical thinking is the belief that we can change the outside world with our thoughts. Think of rain dances and crossed fingers. Or, as Dr. Ben Hunt explains, Fed policy.
Father Christopher J. Pollard, writing in Catholic News Agency, destroys the NeverTrump argument in his essay &amp;ldquo;On Voting.</description>

      <description>If Hillary Clinton wins, Barack Obama will take Antonin Scalia&amp;rsquo;s seat on the Supreme Court.
You NeverTrump cowards need to go read everything you&amp;rsquo;ve written about Barack Obama. Read what you said about his sick dream to fundamentally transform America. Read everything you&amp;rsquo;ve written about his hatred of American exceptionalism.
But go deeper. Stop being cowards for ten minutes and recall what you&amp;rsquo;ve said and thought about Barack Obama. In private conversations.</description>

      <description>Some people have already decided which candidate to vote for. According to polls, slightly more people favor the psychopath over the braggart.
For the undecided, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d create a simple quiz that will tell you whether you&amp;rsquo;re more comfortable with a President who says ugly things and brags about accomplishments or a president who gets people killed and gives away national secrets for cash. I know, it&amp;rsquo;s a tough call.</description>

      <description>Have you ever met someone who&amp;rsquo;s just nasty? Mean? Self-centered? Treats &amp;ldquo;little people&amp;rdquo; like dirt?
If you answered &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to any of these questions, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably met Hillary Clinton. Hillary is likely a psychopath according to official FBI documents released Friday.
What is psychopathy? For the answer, let&amp;rsquo;s go to the bookÂ Almost a PsychopathÂ (h/t Eric Barker):
 Psychopathy is a psychological condition in which the individual shows a profound lack of empathy for the feelings of others, a willingness to engage in immoral and antisocial behavior for short-term gains, and extreme egocentricity.</description>

      <description>CNN is so afraid people will find out they&amp;rsquo;ve been lied to that CNN is lying harder than ever.
It is perfectly legal to visit the Wikileaks.com website. You can even copy information found on the site. Yet CNN&amp;rsquo;s paid liars are telling viewers it&amp;rsquo;s against the law. Plus, they&amp;rsquo;re saying the only way you are allowed to learn the content of the Wikileaks documents is to have it filtered through CNN&amp;rsquo;s official state-sponsored Department of Truth.</description>

      <guid>https://hennessysview.com/2016/10/13/the-art-of-lying/</guid>
      <description>Lying is tough business.
People believe lies with more details. Time, date, people, exact words, what people were wearing, sequences of events. All that. So liars usually provide some gripping details to make their lies more believable.
In casual conversation, this works. Once some sucker buys your lie, you&amp;rsquo;re pretty much in the clear. The problem comes when you broadcast your lie for maximum coverage. The more people who hear the lie, the more people try to verify those details.</description>

      <description>I really want to go to bed, but my brain won&amp;rsquo;t sleep until I type this out.
Hillary Clinton told us Trump won the debate with her final answer. Final answer.
An audience member asked the closing question. He challenged the candidates to say something nice about their opponents. Hillary went first.
The right way to answer those screwball questions is to say something nice and sit down. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why in a moment.</description>

I realize CNN bought a poll that said Clinton won the debate. But CNN has a history of lying, cheating, and hiding facts. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bet a wooden nickel on anything I heard on CNN.
I watched most of the debate at a bar in South St.</description>

      <description>People in the media and the GOP are acting like they learned something on Friday. That&amp;rsquo;s when the Washington Post released an audio (later conjoined with video) of Donald Trump talking lewd about his exploits with women.
I say media people and Republicans are &amp;ldquo;acting&amp;rdquo; like they learned something, because they didn&amp;rsquo;t. We didn&amp;rsquo;t. Everybody who&amp;rsquo;s paid attention to the race (or pop culture) already knew how Trump is. Everybody knows Trump brags about his sexual prowess and how women melt around him.</description>

      <description>Today, Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) abandoned her party&amp;rsquo;s nominee to support a rape accomplice for President. Ann Wagner has lost her moral authority on all matters outside of her own home. I call on Mrs. Wagner to resign from the House of Representatives and to retire gracefully from public life.
Mrs. Wagner seems to believe that being a woman gives her some unique moral vantage point. She forgets that she&amp;rsquo;s not the only woman in America.</description>

      <description>You might have heard that the Clinton campaign released the 2005 audio of Donald Trump on Friday to affect Sunday&amp;rsquo;s debate.
Maybe, but not likely. It&amp;rsquo;s more likely that the story dropped to cover up the latest Hillary email scandal. Gwen Ifill agrees (via Breitbart):
 we would have been paying attention a lot more tonight to some revelations from WikiLeaks about Hillary Clintonâs email â her latest email tranche from the State Department.</description>

      <description>Your life is in danger. At this moment, a Chinese nuclear warhead sits in a missileÂ silo. Its guidance, if launched, instructs the warhead to detonate a mile or two above your home. And this was all made possible by extortion, murder, and illegal campaign contributions to Bill and Hillary Clinton.
Remember Ron Brown? Brown was Clinton&amp;rsquo;s Secretary of Commerce.
Ron Brown ran the Clintons&amp;rsquo; extortion racket in the 1990s.</description>

Yesterday he made a prediction of how we&amp;rsquo;ll kill ISIS. It isn&amp;rsquo;t pretty. He&amp;rsquo;s not advocating what will happen. He&amp;rsquo;s just telling us what will happen.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to offer an alternative end to ISIS. It&amp;rsquo;s one I&amp;rsquo;ve advocated for attacking radical Islam since 2001.</description>

Well, Lester Holt gave it a try.
I want the statements back.
Last night, the debate began with a question and ended with an answer. No opening or closing. Without those framing statements, the whole thing felt like middle musicâa name my colleague gave to the music in upscale hotel lobbies that just goes on and on.</description>

      <description>Donald Trump missed numerous opportunities to use humor to destroy Hillary Clinton Monday night.
The clearest example was on Lester Holt&amp;rsquo;s question on cyber security. Hillary went first and gave a long, robotic answer, hitting all the buzzwords her handlers made her memorize.
Trump countered with a similar answer. But Trump could have crippled Hillary with a single line:
 If you&amp;rsquo;re worried about cyber security, don&amp;rsquo;t elect a woman who runs an email server out of her basement.</description>

First, I&amp;rsquo;d close off any open loops that arose during the debate. Then:
 American children under 10 have never known a year with three-percent GDP growth. Americans under 40 have no memory real wages going up. And American people of every age, from infant to elderly, never knew a time of greater threat from foreign terrorist attack.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re getting close, folks. So close you can feel it. Close your eyes and feel the soft, warm breath on the back of your neck. (Now open your eyes and continue reading. You&amp;rsquo;re such a good reader.)
As you watch the polls shift rapidly toward Trump, you might wonder what&amp;rsquo;s happening. What&amp;rsquo;s happening is completely natural, but it&amp;rsquo;s not normal. Elections don&amp;rsquo;t usually go this way. And two psychological phenomena are working to deliver the Trump landslide I predicted long ago.</description>

      <description>After the Phillies beat the Dodgers on September 20, they owned a 6.5-game lead over the Reds and Cardinals, who were tied for second place. Philadelphia then hosted Cincinnati for three games, and the visiting Reds won all three. Then the Phillies hosted Milwaukee for four, and the visiting Braves won all four. At the end of that series, the Reds were in first place, a game ahead of the Phillies and 1.</description>

      <description>You might wonder why I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about magic so much. What if you let yourself think about magic for a moment? Your mind can make all kinds of connections. It&amp;rsquo;s as if your mind takes you on a journey inside when you think about magic. When you hear &amp;ldquo;magic,&amp;rdquo; you instantly feel like a kid, don&amp;rsquo;t you? Perhaps you can remember when magic was as real to you as your favorite pillow or a treasured blanket.</description>

      <title>More 1980 Election Parallels: Passing Out and Falling Down</title>

      <description>The more you think about it, the more you realize 2016 gets more and more like 1980 every day.
As you ponder Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s fall from grace (even David Axelrod is trashing her now), you might remember Jimmy Carter&amp;rsquo;s collapse.
I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about his collapse on election night. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about one of the two incidents that psychologically destroyed Carter&amp;rsquo;s image as a leader. In a moment, I&amp;rsquo;ll remind you of the collapse.</description>

      <description>Earlier I said the press has covered up Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s horrible health problems. The press (or media as some call it) now admit as much. But they&amp;rsquo;re trying to weasel out of their culpability. See this line from an otherwise sound article on Commentary:
 Â While most serious people dismissed the rumors about Clintonâs health that were being circulated by Donald Trumpâs supporters, what happened Sunday morning will deepen suspicions both about her health and whether her campaign has been telling the truth about it.</description>

      <description>Maybe you felt a twinge of pity when you saw that video of Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s scary collapse today. In a moment you&amp;rsquo;ll see who&amp;rsquo;s to blame, and it&amp;rsquo;s not Hillary. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the disturbing video, here it is, h/tÂ thegatewaypundit.com:

You could write off your emotions to the emotions of the day. It&amp;rsquo;s the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Your nerves are probably a bit frayed as you remember what you were doing when you realized that America was under attack.</description>

      <description>You might find yourself freaking out that NRA endorsed the Democrat for Missouri Governor instead of Republican Eric Greitens. If you think about it, though, the endorsement makes perfect sense from the NRA&amp;rsquo;s perspective.
You realize that the NRA is a lobbying firm, and lobbyists have an easier time working with anÂ established asset like Koster than cultivating an outsider like Greitens. Recruiting and cultivating an asset is to a lobbyist as finding and selling a new customer is to a business.</description>

      <description>Politico announced Tuesday: Clinton&amp;rsquo;s Advisors Tell Her to Prep for a Landslide
Inquisitor said the same day: Hillary Clinton Campaign Preparing for a Landslide
The stories beneath those headlines spoke of the intense hubris inside the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign. Their &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo; declared the race over on Tuesday. Assured of a landslide, Clinton stopped campaigning and turned to what the Clinton&amp;rsquo;s do best: extorting money from the ultra-rich.</description>

      <description>Nobody likes confrontation and conflict, am I right? But who doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind being lost in pretend for a little? So let&amp;rsquo;s just pretend it&amp;rsquo;s September 20, one week before the Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump appear at a joint press conference. (It&amp;rsquo;s not a debate. Hillary&amp;rsquo;s health won&amp;rsquo;t be up to a debate that soon.)
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s pretend that Trump&amp;rsquo;s outreach to Hispanics and blacks worked because Trump&amp;rsquo;s ahead in the polls.</description>

      <title>BREAKING: FBI Report Confirms Hillary&#39;s Guilty Mental Problems</title>

      <description>The FBI dumped its Clinton criminal investigation report today, and it&amp;rsquo;s full of bombshells. Bombs are exploding like the 4th of July, especially the way Clinton lied about Gen. Colin Powell.
Clinton has maintained that Powell advised her to use a private email and cell phone instead of using secure systems provided by the US government.
Hillary lied.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what the FBI found:
 Clinton contacted former Secretary of State Colin Powell via e-mail to inquire about his use of a BlackBerry while he was Secretary of State .</description>

      <description>Donald Trump will land in Mexico City. He&amp;rsquo;s there for a summit meeting with Mexico&amp;rsquo;s President Pena Nieto.
Before Trump even woke up this morning, the Washington Post declared the future meeting a complete disaster that Trump will never recover from. The Post predicted a complete visual and verbal disaster even though there&amp;rsquo;s no historical evidence on which to base such a prediction.
The WaPo is probably projecting its wishes, not its beliefs.</description>

      <description>If this shocks you, you&amp;rsquo;re probably a racist. I probably am, too.
Blacks want the same things whites want. Well, blacks want the same things non-elitist whites want. And it&amp;rsquo;s been quantified. By a Jew. Here&amp;rsquo;s what he found, as reported by Business Insider:
 His report (featured below) found that black voters care most about lowering taxes in their community, having a strong leader, creating jobs, changing the tax code to help workers and small businesses, making college affordable, and improving the financial health of the US.</description>

      <description>Admit it: words trump action. And words trump results.
No one really cares what you do or the consequences of your actions. They care about what you say.
That&amp;rsquo;s what we learned in school, right? That action is cheap but words are priceless. You probably memorized this nursery rhyme:
 Verbs and nouns Can break our crowns But deeds can never hurt us.
 There was another nursery rhyme with the same meter and opposite meaning.</description>

      <description>If you enjoy this post, you have to thank your fellow reader, Tony, for reading the whole TIME article from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post. He pointed out more similarities between 1980 and 2016. Especially Reagan&amp;rsquo;s gaffes and Democrats&amp;rsquo; complacency.
First, the gaffes.
You hear about Trump stepping on his own applause lines. He announced Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway the day after the best speech of his life (until then). He wondered aloud (via Twitter) what Mr.</description>

      <description>You probably remember that in September 1980 voters couldnât wait to cast a vote for Reagan.
If you remember it like that, you remember wrong. At least a little wrong.
TIME magazine examined voter sentiment in its September 15, 1980, issue. Voters that year sounded a lot like voters this year. Hereâs how TIMEâs Ed Magnuson summarized the voters of 1980:
 Disenchanted, but not apathetic. Caring about issues, although much more concerned about character.</description>

Americaâs fiscal year is October 1 to September 30.Â With two month left in FY16, the U.S. Treasury has already paid creditors $380,925,428,211.67 in interest costs.Â (Thatâs $381 Billion)Â https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm
The average interest rate was just over 2%.Â https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/pd/avg/2016/2016_07.htm
Â It is expected that the last two monthâs of this fiscal year, interest costs will increase another $45 to $66 Billion.Â The total FY16 interest cost may be between $426 and $447 Billion.</description>

      <description>You might be wondering why the Missouri Farm Bureau endorsed Democrat Chris Koster instead of Republican Eric Greitens. The Farm Bureau endorses Republicans about 99% of the time.
If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking it had to do with policy or personality, you&amp;rsquo;re thinking wrong. (And, no, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t because of Koster&amp;rsquo;s hair, Mark Reardon.)Â This was all about the establishment vs. the people.Â It&amp;rsquo;s about power and control. Greitens threatens the establishment.</description>

      <title>Purpose Trumps Policy and PrinciplesâVideo</title>

      <description>Why did Trump beat Ted Cruz?Â Probably the biggest reason is that Trump talks purpose while Cruz talks policy and principles.
When people hear Trump, they hear a purpose that aligns with their purpose. I know I do. And it&amp;rsquo;s similar to the purpose Arthur C. Brooks explained in his great book, The Conservative Heart.
Ted Cruz never seemed to have a purpose, just policies and principles. Cruz spoke of abstract principles and left it to the people to figure out if those principles would make their lives better or worse.</description>

      <description>I was a guest of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM channel 125 yesterday. Dan Riehl wrote this very nice story about my appearance on Breitbart News:
   Tea Party activist BillÂ Hennessy chronicled his transition from Donald Trump opposition to Trump supporter in theÂ bookÂ Turning on TrumpÂ and shared some of his insights with_Breitbart News Daily_ SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon Wednesday.  âI started off very anti-Trump,â said Hennessy, âand over the course of the primary season, I did a complete one-eighty.</description>

      <description>Navy SEAL Eric Greitens won the first political race of his life. Few first timers win a major party&amp;rsquo;s nomination for governor of a state. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably hear just how rare Greitens&amp;rsquo;s feat was. But not tonight. I want to tell some stories.
Eric Greitens gave up a morning of this campaign to talk to one of my kids. That kid is a man now. He&amp;rsquo;s in the Navy at a helo combat squadron in San Diego.</description>

      <description>This was supposed to be a longer post, so I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you why I&amp;rsquo;m voting for Eric Greitens in a minute. First, why I have to cut it short.
I got home from door knocking for Eric at about 6:30 and walked straight to my laptop to write. Just as I sat down, my wife called me to dinner. She&amp;rsquo;d already eaten, but she heated up my dinner, called to me, then walked into our living room and shrieked.</description>

      <description>From Dr. Ben Carson:
   President Obama and his allies are trying to hijack the Republican primary in Missouri by attacking my good friend Eric Greitens.
    Like me, Eric is a conservative outsider, and that means the political establishment is terrified of him. Obama and his allies are now spending a million dollars falsely attacking Eric Greitens and trying to fool the people of Missouri.</description>

      <description>Do you want to help Democrats win? You can, and the Democratic Governors Association just told you how.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a Republican and you follow the advice of the Democratic Governors Association, you won&amp;rsquo;t vote for Eric Greitens. The DGA wants Democrat Chris Koster to win, so Democrats are telling Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Republicans not to nominate Greitens. Democrats believe Greitens beats Koster in November.
Smart people know that you watch what people do, not what they say.</description>

Why Now? Why did Holzer choose last week to out himself? Why show himself now, putting his old boss, John Brunner, in such a bad light? And right before the August 2 primary?
**Holzer has damaged Brunner&amp;rsquo;s reputation and credibility.Â **And Brunner spent a ton of his own money in the process, including paying $100,000 to the guy who made the video, then squealed about it.</description>

      <description>This is part II of a three-part series. Here&amp;rsquo;s part__I.
That Shadowy Paul Holzer Paul Holzer is a former Navy SEAL Lieutenant Commander and a medical student at Dartmouth in New Hampshire. (Oddly, his bio shows MD, MBA, even though is still in medical school and simultaneously working toward an MBA.) Holzer also runs a biotech 501c3 and a political consulting firm, Draper Sterling LLC. He did some work for Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign, and he was John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s chief of staff last year.</description>

      <description>Why in the world would a political operative who once worked for John Brunner out himself and expose Brunner as either a liar or a patsy two weeks before an election?
 Reggie Lampert: Of course, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to lie on your back for a while but then you can lie from any position, can&amp;rsquo;t you? &amp;ndash;Charade, 1963
 Things just got weirder in Missouri. After the stunning revelation that people associated with John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s campaign did, in fact, produce a false, negative video attacking Eric Greitens, you might be wondering what&amp;rsquo;s going on?</description>

      <description>Contrasts.
Two Politico stories, just weeks apart, demonstrate the remarkable contrasts between the two candidates for president.
The headline of the Trump story tells it all:
 Trump raised $32 million with RNC, but kept only a fraction.
 And the Hillary story:
 Leaked emails show officials tried to obscure the fact that Clinton allowed states to keep only a tiny fraction of proceeds from joint fundraising.
 Trump is on Team America.</description>

      <description>Now it makes so much sense. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I missed it. Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign is so perfectly consistent, it&amp;rsquo;s almost scary. No, it is scary. It means we&amp;rsquo;re down to our last hope.
When I Turned On Trump I put this in my book, Turning On Trump. I remember the night. I wrote late. Something hit me like wolves howling in the distance. Telling me something had changed. Or some ancient truth, long buried, had been uncovered.</description>

      <description>Another terrorist attack is going on in Munich, Germany right now. At least 3 people are dead, but police can&amp;rsquo;t get into the shooting sites to find out how bad it is. Shooters are still at large. All public transportation has been shut down because terrorists are shooting up subways, too. There&amp;rsquo;s a 99% chance the terrorists are Muslim immigrants. This is what Hillary&amp;rsquo;s immigration plan looks like.
Two days ago, a Muslim immigrant went on an ax-hacking spree on a German train.</description>

So many myths dispelled.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying to put my finger on exactly why I found Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s remarks Wednesday night so incredibly distasteful.
The Pledge thing is a goodly part of it.
Simply put, the parties to the Pledge Ted Cruz signed were only Ted Cruz and the RNC (by extension, you can probably include the delegates and voters, too).
The Pledge promised support, including data, from the RNC in exchange for Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s endorsement of the eventual nominee.</description>

      <description>Parts pulled from comments to this post:
Today Cruz proved himself to be Lyin&amp;rsquo; Ted again.
After swearing that his non-endorsement was all about &amp;ldquo;freedom and the Constitution,&amp;rdquo; he admitted today that he broke his oath of support solely because Trump insulted his wife and his father. For Ted, this was personal, not business.
Ted could have told us it was personal last night. But he lied instead. He could have said something else, too.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking that Ted Cruz made Donald Trump look bad last night. And he did. Ted Cruz had a prime time speaking slot and he failed to endorse his party&amp;rsquo;s nominee for president. Hillary Clinton will use it.
A lot of people are saying Trump shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have invited him to speak unless Cruz agreed to endorse Trump. But Trump didn&amp;rsquo;t even ask for Cruz&amp;rsquo;s endorsement. Trump just offered Ted the prime time spot, and Ted took it.</description>

      <description>In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t hear, Donald Trump invited Ted Cruz to speak at the RNC in prime time with no expectation that Cruz would keep his word by endorsing Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz immediately accepted the prime time speaking spot.
In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t hear, Donald Trump waived his right to review Senator Cruz&amp;rsquo;s speech in advance, the first time that&amp;rsquo;s happened in our lifetimes according to Tucker Carlson. Mr. Trump respects Senator Cruz enough to let the senator say whatever he wants.</description>

Now, Hillary and Obama have lost control of the fire they started. Crazed, racist murderers all across the country have declared war on police officers. From Dallas, Texas, to Ballwin, Missouri, to Baton Rouge, Louisianna, Hillary has sent a message that says it&amp;rsquo;s okay to kill a cop.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t look at Facebook too often. I have been on Facebook lately because it&amp;rsquo;s a great vehicle for book sales, but I really don&amp;rsquo;t like it.
One problem with Facebook is that I can see what people are thinking. And so many people I know and respect think some really dumb things.</description>

      <description>Good morning.
One of the reasons Trump will win in a landslide is safety. Trump has warned for years that we are weak and political correctness makes us weaker. Everybody knows he&amp;rsquo;s right. NeverTrumpers were saying this until Trump said it.
Last night,** a Muslim terrorist killed at least 84 people in Nice, France**. They were ordinary people lined up to watch fireworks, the same way you did on the 4th of July.</description>

      <title>Why I&#39;m Voting for Eric Greitens Governor</title>

      <description>I believe the greatest threat to human freedom and thriving is the political class. That smirking political class infects both Washington, DC, and Jefferson City, Missouri. And I believe only one candidate has the courage, the brains, and the commitment to destroy that political class in Missouri. That candidate is Eric Greitens.
Do you want to live as a slave to that smirking political class? Or do you want to live free and thrive?</description>

      <description>You know how this game goes. You make a wish, I&amp;rsquo;ll do my damnedest to grant it. Because I am just that kinkkind of guy.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, aka Notorious RBG, made aÂ wish last week. Being a lawyer, her wish came with a contingency.
I just launched a GoFund.Meproject to grant her that wish. And why not?
Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a true Horatio Alger story. Born to Russian-Jewish immigrant parents, raised in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, RBG rose the highest legal position in the United States: Supreme Court Justice.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;sÂ possible that some NeverTrumper has already gone there, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it.
Up until now, one complaint of the NeverTurmpers has been that Mr. Trump will hurt Republicans running for Senate, the House, and state offices. They make this claim knowing full well that Trump is ahead of Romney in every poll and with every demographic group. I predict that, come October, people will be saying Trump is virtually running unopposed.</description>

Now, in this foul year of our Lord twenty-sixteen, just over 300,000 people call the city home. A 70 percent decline!
And I&amp;rsquo;m not one of them. For several reasons that no reasonable person could argue with.</description>

      <title>Caution: Identifying as &#39;NeverTrump&#39; Changes Your Brain</title>

      <description>When a person declares himself &amp;ldquo;NeverTrump,&amp;rdquo; he thinks he&amp;rsquo;s making a political statement. Or a moral one. But he&amp;rsquo;s not. He&amp;rsquo;s making a psychological commitment that&amp;rsquo;s very difficult and painful to break.
Identity is the highest, most powerful form of persuasion. Identity also drives our decisions in parts of the brain we don&amp;rsquo;t really have conscious control over. I realize many conservatives reject brain science, but, for those of you who are open to learning, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain as best I can in a moment.</description>

      <description>NeverTrumpers who don&amp;rsquo;t cross over stand to get a lot of blood on their hands. I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one noticing. If anything, I&amp;rsquo;m understating the case. Now we know: to be anti-Trump is to be pro-abortion and pro-race war.Â To be anti-Trump is to support violence against police officers, especially white police officers. That&amp;rsquo;s because Hillary is all those things, and to be anti-Trump is,Â logically, to be pro-Hillary. (If they both live until January 20, either Clinton or Trump will be the next president.</description>

      <description>His argument shocked me. I needed more time to think about it, so my response was weak. Maybe that was his intention. To knock me off my game. It worked, but for a very bad reason. I bet he&amp;rsquo;d like to take it back now, so pay close attention.
You, like me, probably know you&amp;rsquo;re not responsible for what anyone else does, and other people&amp;rsquo;s behavior doesn&amp;rsquo;t excuse your behavior. You agree with that, don&amp;rsquo;t you?</description>

      <description>Imagine if you posted on Facebook, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to the store,&amp;rdquo; and someone replied, &amp;ldquo;How come you&amp;rsquo;re going to buy the world&amp;rsquo;s largest vibrating dildo?&amp;rdquo;
That other person would deny he&amp;rsquo;s lying, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t he? If you accused him of lying, he&amp;rsquo;d fire off a series of defenses:
** It was a question, not a statement ** You didn&amp;rsquo;t say you weren&amp;rsquo;t going to buy the world&amp;rsquo;s largest dildo, did you? ** Can you prove you weren&amp;rsquo;t planning to get the world&amp;rsquo;s largest vibrating dildo?</description>

      <description>A lot of people are mad at FBI Director James Comey. Comey read a list of crimes committed by Hillary Clinton, then announced he couldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend prosecution for those crimes. On its face, it sounds like Comey caved.
Let&amp;rsquo;s play the imagine game. Imagine Comey decided to refer Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s crimes to the Department of Justice for prosecution. What would happen?
First, you&amp;rsquo;d never hear about it. The FBI and the DOJ don&amp;rsquo;t discuss active criminal investigations.</description>

      <description>Many people grew up with dogs and backyards. If you are such a person, you probably remember being to told to make sure the gate&amp;rsquo;s shut and locked. Or maybe you were told not to use the gate at all because the dog might get out.
A lot of people who grew up with dogs suffered emotional trauma when something bad happened to their dog. Imagine how you&amp;rsquo;d feel if you were seven or eight and you left the gate open and the dog got out and got hit by a car.</description>

Where did you get news of this latest terrorist attack? Facebook? Television? Radio?
Do you remember what you were doing when you heard the news? Take a moment to think back to when you first heard the news.</description>

      <description>Some people say they&amp;rsquo;re afraid of Donald Trump for bizarre reasons. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard he&amp;rsquo;s a dictator, a fascist, a genocidal maniac, and a lousy businessman. If any of that is true, there&amp;rsquo;s no evidence of it, so he must also own all the media already. And the internet. In fact, if Trump is a lousy businessman who managed to bungle his way to a $10 billion fortune, he must really bad at dictatoring, because he hasn&amp;rsquo;t even conquered his home country in 70 years.</description>

      <description>You knew it would happen, didn&amp;rsquo;t you?
Corey Lewandowski, the obscure, small-potatoes political operative from a tiny state couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly run a presidential campaign from start to victory, could he?
But this isn&amp;rsquo;t about Corey Lewandowski. It&amp;rsquo;s about the next the president of the United States, Donald Trump. And you&amp;rsquo;ll want to read it all because it&amp;rsquo;s so true. So true.
I read a summary of what happened at Lewandowski&amp;rsquo;s dismissal meeting, and it sounded exactly like an episode of The Apprentice.</description>

      <description>You likely heard about the letter of the girl who was sexually assaulted on Stanford&amp;rsquo;s campus. Two passers-by saw a man molesting an unconscious woman. The man was sentenced to six months in jail and three years&amp;rsquo; probation. Many people were outraged by the sentence, but no one told the woman she needs to do some soul searching,Â did they?
But why not? Why not ask the woman to reflect on her actions and things she might have said.</description>

      <description>With the Islamic massacre at a gay club in Orlando, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of talk about jihad and guns. The Gateway Pundit does a great job of keeping you informed. So you don&amp;rsquo;t need me adding noise. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about statistics, which everybody loves.
There are about 320 million people in the United States. About one percent are Muslims. By comparison, about 2.5 percent of Americans are Jewish. It&amp;rsquo;s safe to say, then, that there are about 2.</description>

      <description>Trump is now running unopposed for president because his only opponent is an empty pantsuit.
Hillary Clinton uses other people&amp;rsquo;s money to surround herself with nearly 1,000 paid staff. Direct paid staff. That a HUGE support team for a crooked sexist like Hillary.
Donald Trump spends his own money, so he hires only enough people to get the job done. Trump understands money and people, while Hillary understands comfort.
Tonight, Hillary Clinton exposed herself as an amateur in the world of communication.</description>

      <description>A lot of people are mad at Paul Ryan. Millions of people want Mr. Ryan to step down as Speaker of the House. I am not mad at him. Paul Ryan is a victim of his circumstances, just like a lot of other Republicans.
Paul Ryan stepped up to a microphone this week and said what he was programmed to say. Essentially, Mr. Ryan said he&amp;rsquo;s not happy with Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s statements about a La Raza judge who started issuing anti-Trump rulings after Trump called on America to enforce its immigration laws.</description>

      <description>Republicans hate race.Â RaceÂ has been bad for the GOP ever since Republicans passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See, Lyndon Johnson was a Democrat, and he proposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Most Democrats violently opposed the bill. But most Republicans supported it. The bill passed, of course, and it survived many Supreme Court challenges.
The Civil Rights Act&amp;rsquo;s aim was to wring racist behavior out of American life.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard the news that Donald Trump believes it&amp;rsquo;s possible for a Muslim judge to treat him unfairly. Do you think Trump is wrong about this?
When asked by a reporter if Trump believed it would be possible for a Muslim judge to treat him unfairly, Trump answered, &amp;ldquo;Itâs possible, yes. Yeah. That would be possible, absolutely.&amp;rdquo;
Notice that Trump didn&amp;rsquo;t say, &amp;ldquo;all Muslim judges are unfair to me.&amp;rdquo; Nor did he say all Hispanic judges are unfair.</description>

      <description>Do you want to know what Trump supporters are thinking? Many people do.
If you supported Ted Cruz, you might not understand how the guy who wrote The Conservative Manifesto in 1993 could support Trump.
If you supported Marco Rubio or Ben Carson last year, how do you reconcile your convictions with Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s bizarre life?
Is Donald Trump a conservative or not?
I&amp;rsquo;ve written a new book about all these things, and you can buy your copy soon.</description>

      <description>I admire David French, David French is running for president, but you probably have no idea who he is, right?
No, it&amp;rsquo;s not Buffy and Jody&amp;rsquo;s man-nanny from the 1960s sitcom Family Affair. That was Mr. French played by Sebastian Cabot, and I forget the character&amp;rsquo;s first name.
Nor is it the guy who publishes most stage play scripts. That&amp;rsquo;s Samuel French. (OnlyÂ theatre people will know that name.)
If you&amp;rsquo;re a hard-core conservative or you read National Review for any reason, you might have heard of David French.</description>

      <description>Try not to imagine the worldwide television audience for the Trump vs. Sanders debate. Super Bowl ratings would look skimpy by comparison. Trump vs. Sanders would be the most watched political event ever. And I&amp;rsquo;m including the future in &amp;ldquo;ever.&amp;rdquo; And a Trump vs. Sanders debate would effectively kill Democrats&amp;rsquo; chances in November. This is huge.
Yesterday, I wrote about Trump&amp;rsquo;s remarkable honesty at his press conference, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the big story of the day.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s what the press refuses to tell you: The man in the picture is the next President of the United States. You might as well start calling him &amp;ldquo;President Trump.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Say what you want about Donald Trump, the customer service at his properties is insanely great. And The Donald personally sets the standard for that service. He also inspects it, and he has a sick level of attention to detail. Donald Trump doesn&amp;rsquo;t miss a thing when it comes to providing a perfect environment for his guests and residents.
The opposite is true of the TSA. Like most government-run operations, the TSA sucks at customer service.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed a lot of people are saying &amp;ldquo;President Trump&amp;rdquo; lately. And reading &amp;ldquo;President Trump&amp;rdquo; online, haven&amp;rsquo;t you?
If not, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably notice it later today or tomorrow.
[Tweet &amp;ldquo;CatchÂ yourself saying &amp;lsquo;President Trump&amp;rsquo; now? @realDonaldTrump&amp;rdquo;]
It&amp;rsquo;s common during election years for pundits to occasionally say &amp;ldquo;President So-and-so,&amp;rdquo; usually sarcastically. And some &amp;ldquo;President Trump&amp;rdquo; talk is sarcastic. But most of this President Trump talk is subconscious prediction. People thinkÂ President Trump isÂ a thing, so their brains are warming up.</description>

      <title>How Conservatives Abandoned Principles Over Trump</title>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably been hearing a lot about &amp;ldquo;principles&amp;rdquo; lately. Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s entire campaign centered &amp;ldquo;conservative principles&amp;rdquo; and being a &amp;ldquo;principled conservative.&amp;rdquo;
Lately, though, most of that &amp;ldquo;principles&amp;rdquo; talk is about how Donald Trump has caused good conservatives to abandon their principles.
Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s true. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to believe it.
The one principle that many conservatives have abandoned and encouraged others to abandon: keeping your word.
The lead advocate for abandoning this principle of keeping one&amp;rsquo;s word is Jonah Goldberg of National Review and the American Enterprise Institute.</description>

      <description>You mightÂ have noticed that my predictions have been remarkably accurate lately, have you not?
For example, on Sunday, May 1, I predicted Ted Cruz would suspend his campaign after getting trounced in Indiana. Two days later, Cruz lost the Indiana primary to Donald Trump 53 to 36. At the time I wrote, many pundits and pollster still believed Cruz could win that Indiana race, and everyone believed Cruz was telling the truth when he said repeatedly he was staying in the race to Cleveland unless Trump reached 1,237 delegates before then.</description>

      <description>Nothing happens in politics by accident. Every move has an angle. Some players are better than others. Paul Ryan and Donald Trump are two of the best players alive, but one is better than the other. We&amp;rsquo;ll see that tomorrow.
House Speaker Paul Ryan has set aside Thursday for meetings with his party&amp;rsquo;s nominee for President. Every nominee for president meets with the senior members of his party&amp;rsquo;s Congressional caucus, so there&amp;rsquo;s nothing odd about the meeting.</description>

      <description>Some pro-life activists like Erick Erickson are plotting ways to sabotage Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s candidacy for president. They probably haven&amp;rsquo;t stopped to think. If they succeed in defeating Trump, they will be culpable in many, many abortions. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of guilt for a guy like Erickson to carry around, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?
Chances are Congress won&amp;rsquo;t introduce any major abortion laws in the next four years. That means the abortion battle will remain in the courts.</description>

      <description>People think they&amp;rsquo;re rational, but we&amp;rsquo;reÂ not. For example, on manyÂ issues,** Trump&amp;rsquo;s positions are almost identical to Ronald Reagan&amp;rsquo;s.** When it comes to abortion, trade, taxes, foreign policy and the military, and entitlements like Social Security, you can&amp;rsquo;t fit a dime between Reagan and Trump.
So why do people see Trump as far to the left of Reagan?
Contrasts and comparisons.
Reagan ran against George Bush and John B. Anderson.</description>

      <description>Every prediction about Trump has been wrong. Except for two. Ann Coulter and Scott Adams predicted Trump would win the nomination and, eventually, the White House in a landslide. They were right.
World leaders expect Trump to win, and they are lining up to make all his crazy assertions look like brilliant predictions.
Former Mexico president Vicente Fox apologized to Trump, and Trump graciously accepted. That&amp;rsquo;s a sign that Mexicans expect Trump to become the next US president.</description>

For me, I&amp;rsquo;m for Trump. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit he wasn&amp;rsquo;t my first choice, but he was far from my last choice. My first choice, Ben Carson, endorsed The Donald.</description>

      <description>I have no idea who will win the Indiana primary 72 hours from the time I write. But the people inside Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s campaign seem to have an idea. And it&amp;rsquo;s not good for them. Cruz&amp;rsquo;s top team expects their candidate to lose. And Senator Cruz seems to have accepted that outcome.
Expectations Matter More Than Preferences Regular readers know that polls that ask &amp;ldquo;who do you think will win&amp;rdquo; trump polls that ask &amp;ldquo;who do you intend to vote for&amp;rdquo; or even &amp;ldquo;who did you vote for?</description>

      <description>That was a strategic kill-shot, to borrow Scott Adams&amp;rsquo;s word. And it changes everything for conservatives.
After a so-so debate performance and in the middle of a 16-hour verbal assault from Marco Rubio, Trump went nuclear. But not the way everyone would expect Trump to go nuclear.
Trump didn&amp;rsquo;t need to invent a brilliant new put-down line to counter Marco. Instead, he calmly introduced Chris Christie to 10,000 fans in Texas.</description>

      <description>The world is about to end.
Or civil war is about to break out in Dayton, Ohio.
Believe it?
Glenn Beck, Erick Erickson, and other Republicans have convinced a lot of people that we are doomed ifÂ Donald Trump wins the Republican nomination. I know some people who are nearly incapacitated with fear and grief after last night&amp;rsquo;s Nevada caucuses. Because they listen to Glenn Beck. Sad!
Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: **nothing is as bad as you think it will be while you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about it.</description>

      <description>You might have heard that State Senator Dave Schatz gutted ethics reform in Missouri. According to Ryan Johnson of Missouri Alliance for Freedom:
 Cleaning up the practice of Jefferson Cityâs revolving door is the reason for Rep. Caleb RowdenâsÂ House Bill 1979Â (carried in the Senate by Sen. Bob Onder). It puts in place a one year cooling off period that will make legislators sit out for at least a year before lobbying.</description>

      <description>Ted Cruz has a powerful strategy available to him. This strategy could not only determine the winner of the Republican convention but put Cruz in position to influence policy for generations.
But it&amp;rsquo;s probably not what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to lay out some assumptions, many of which you could disagree with. That&amp;rsquo;s okay. But for the purposes of this post, let&amp;rsquo;s stipulate:
*1. Ted Cruz believes, like Glenn Beck, thatÂ Donald Trump would make a worse president than Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, or Bernie Sanders.</description>

I put a lot of stock into generational history. I am a big fan of Howe and Strauss, a pair of historians whose works includeÂ Generations: The History of America&amp;rsquo;s Future,Â 13ers: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?,Â MillennialsÂ Rising, and, my favorite,Â The Fourth Turning.
As someone born in the 13th generation of Americans, more commonly called Generation X after the book by Douglas Coupland, I am overly captivated byÂ that generation.</description>

      <description>The government wants Apple to build a back door into the iPhone. Apple has refused.
Iâm with Apple on this one.
This back door would allow the FBI to access the content of the San Bernardino terroristsâ phone, possibly exposing more terrorists. That would be a good thing.
But Apple never built a back door to the iPhone because no one can control the keys to such portals. If Apple builds it, every government spy agency in the world will be able to read your texts, see where youâve been, and listen to your phone calls.</description>

      <description>Pope Francis said today that Donald Trump is not a Christian.
I can only assume the Pope has secretly cut a deal with The Donald.
&amp;ldquo;Pope. Donald here. I need you to give me some crap about the wall.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Si.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Just, uh, call me a Muslim or something. Make it look sincere, ya know?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Si.&amp;rdquo;
So the Pope stands at the U.S.-Mexico border and says anyone who wants to build a wall &amp;ldquo;is not a Christian.</description>

      <description>How people responded to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post, Maybe he&amp;rsquo;s not a conservative, varied. But there were two dominant types.
Surface thinkers ignored most of the content. I warned you about this early on. I decided against a deep examination of conservatism because people don&amp;rsquo;t care. Instead, I wrote a rather tongue-in-cheek story about why definitions of conservatism don&amp;rsquo;t matter.
Deep thinkers got the tongue-in-cheek shtick. Maybe they rolled their eyes at my cheap attempt at being clever.</description>

      <description>As far as I can tell, the number one reason a few conservatives give for hating Eric Greitens is that he might not be a conservative. He&amp;rsquo;s probably not. But that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t make any difference.
Figuring out whether Greitens is a conservative or not requires a lot of thinking, a lot of writing, and a lot of clear analysis from readers. I won&amp;rsquo;t waste time on the first two because I won&amp;rsquo;t get the last no matter what.</description>

I also learned that Eric Greitens has some really stupid opponents. Cowardly, stupid weasels. Cowardly because Greitens&amp;rsquo;s opponents funded, produced, and promoted an anonymous video, packed with lies. Stupid because that video so infuriated Missouri&amp;rsquo;s 500,000 military veterans that Greitens is picking up new supporters.</description>

      <description>[Stream of consciousness. Please forgive errors and craziness.]
The human brain is very bad at looking to the future.
It&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to imagine a living person not being here. We naturally assume the future will be a linear progression of the recent past.
Then one of five conservative Supreme Court justices dies. And everything&amp;rsquo;s thrown into chaos.
We have only eleven months until a new president takes the oath of office.</description>

The American people get to decide who moves into the United States.Â If immigrants are coming for a free meal, we donât need them.Â If immigrants are coming for free healthcare, we donât need them.Â If immigrants are coming for free housing, we donât need them.Â If immigrants are coming and their presence in the United States increases the public debt, we definitely donât need them.
If immigrants come here to improve their lives and the lives of their family members WITHOUT becoming a burden on American society, we will seriously consider their application.</description>

      <description>I am Catholic.
I believe in and trust the magisterium of the church.
Nothing distinguishes me from Protestants more profoundly than that concept: the magisterium, or the teaching authority, of the church.
For me, the church is like Locke and Jefferson and Madison. They were learned men who read Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, Cato, Epictetus, Epicurus, and other Greek and Roman philosophers, often in the original languages.
Those philosophical and political founders interpreted and organized ancient philosophy for England and America.</description>

      <description>Leverage: donât make deals without it.
 &amp;ndash;Donald Trump, The Art of the Deal, 1987
It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to go Machiavellian during primaries. Even during general elections after primaries. But there&amp;rsquo;s a great danger for the grassroots.
**If we don&amp;rsquo;t hold candidates accountable during the race when we have all the leverage, how can we possibly hold office-holders accountable?Â **
Check out this paragraph from the Washington Post:
   Cruz offered a lawyerly defense of his campaignâs actions, blaming media reporting for the mistake.</description>

      <description>The polls were wrong. But that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the biggest shock.
The big shock was . . . who was that guy pretending to be Donald Trump?
Millions and millions of people waited to watch The Donald melt down after finishing second behind Ted Cruz.
But it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. Instead, Trump managed to show humility and graciousness without giving up his signature bravado. Pretty brilliant. As Romney and Rove learned in 2012, though, air power will not win many races.</description>

I was in Washington, DC, over the weekend when it dawned on me that we on the right were probably wrong about Obama&amp;rsquo;s thirst for dictatorial power. Or maybe we were right, but seven years of near-dictatorial power have exhausted the would-be autocrat. He certain looks worn down, as this Time magazine side-by-side shows:

      <description>This &amp;ldquo;VOTING VIOLATION&amp;rdquo; controversyÂ says bad things about the Cruz campaign.
(BTW, Rubio&amp;rsquo;s campaign sent a similar, but less creepy, mailer, too. So far, I have not seen a large number of complaints about the Rubio mailer.)
And I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the ethics of publicly shaming people who vote sporadically. I&amp;rsquo;m talking two gross electioneering violations from a campaign that markets itself as the most scientifically advanced in history. With the mailer Team Cruz showed a lack of strategic understanding of the science and compounded their ignorance by apparently making up numbers.</description>

I gotta tell ya, the people at Fox News are stupid. Dumb. Ignorant. Pliable. Oafish. Any word you want you to use that means cognitively challenged (for the politically correct).
But the Fox Newsmorons have a lot of company at National Review.
Trump is playing these media elites like a fiddle.

National Review has entered dangerous territory: they have inadvertently made the case for Trump.
An angry screed by Kevin Williamson titled &amp;ldquo;Our Post-Literate Politics&amp;rdquo; (later renamed to &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s a Book?&amp;quot;) makes the case that Trump supporters are illiterate, uneducated, dim-witted, racist, homophobes.

      <description>Reading two excellent articles by Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight (here and here), I remembered a thought that passed through my mind last Friday.
After reading some of National Review&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Against Trump&amp;rdquo; issue,I wroteÂ blog post. To me the NR issue showed the magazine is out of touch with voters. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about traditional, reliable, motivated, and informed primary voters.** I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the broader pool of voters who vote in general elections every four, eight, or twelve years** and occasionally in local elections.</description>

      <description>**Expectations matter most in how undecided voters decide.Â **
It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand how late-deciders tend to vote. This knowledge (especially in Iowa and New Hampshire) could decide the outcome.
Primary voters tend to decide whom to for at the last minute.
In 2008, 16 percent of voters said they made their choice on election day. Which means we have a long way to go to know how Iowa will turn out.</description>

      <description>_UPDATE: Originally I mentioned &amp;ldquo;apparently fake twitter account.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve learned (after lots of research) that I was mistaken. I&amp;rsquo;ve removed that statement. Please continue reading. My carelessness wasÂ completely my own.Â _
I agree with Ted Cruz. And welcome Big Government readers.
Senator Cruz said,Â &amp;ldquo;Katrina Pierson is an utterly fearless principled conservative.&amp;rdquo;
That was just two years ago. Katrina Pierson was challenging Pete Sessions for Congress.
I also agree with Ted&amp;rsquo;s dad, Rafael Cruz, who said of Katrina, &amp;ldquo;Sheâs a strict constitutionalist.</description>

      <description>They. Don&amp;rsquo;t. Care.
The conservative war against Trump won&amp;rsquo;t work.
I get why National Review and The Weekly Standard devote whole issues of magazines to Trump&amp;rsquo;s lack of conservative bonafides. I appreciate it. Their work is important. **But theirÂ tactic will prove completely useless in defeating Trump.Â **In fact, the fight is already over, and the cover story proves it.
Conservative magazines&amp;ndash;online or on paper&amp;ndash;are supposed to weigh events and people against conservative principles and pass judgment.</description>

Conspiracy theories satisfy a psychological need to blame others for our problems or explain why the world doesn&amp;rsquo;t work the way we wish it worked.
Maybe two nuns in Peoria found a cure for cancer in 1954 and Big Pharma really did pay J. Edgar Hoover to seize the formula to keep the multi-billion dollar oncology pharmaceutical money-printer cranking out the bucks at full speed.</description>

      <description>When I was a kid (thought I felt kind of old at the time) disaster movies were the thing.
Before Star Wars, the 1970s were about killer sharks, towering infernos, earthquakes, and capsized cruise ships.
Psychologists and sociologistsÂ attributed the genre&amp;rsquo;s popularity to the people&amp;rsquo;s need to assimilate nuclear holocaust.
I think the movies were just good, cathartic entertainment.

They didn&amp;rsquo;t use guns and bombs. They used their bodies. On women.
This created a political-correctness nightmare for Europe&amp;rsquo;s leaders. On the one hand, the victims were women, and no means no, and we must always believe a woman who accuses a man of sexual predation (unless the man is Bill Clinton in which case we destroy the woman).
On the other hand, the assailants .</description>

      <description>You have another chance to improve government and fight petty tyranny by supporting Senator Eric Schmitt&amp;rsquo;s latest bill to hold local government accountable.
Last year, Senator Schmitt became the champion of responsible local government with SB-5, a bill designed to end &amp;ldquo;taxation by citation&amp;rdquo; in local governments.
This year, Senator Schmitt is back to close a loophole that some cities are exploiting to suck more money out of residents who can least afford it.</description>

      <description>I figured it out about the same time Ben Hochman of the Post Dispatch did: Stan Kroenke wrote a letter designed to force the owners to move the Rams to Los Angeles right now.
The acrimony created by Kroenke&amp;rsquo;s relocation request letter makes the situation in St. Louis untenable for the team and its owner. In short, Kroenke calls St. Louis a second-rate, economically depressed, crime-infest toilet of a city full of people so obsessed with baseball that no other sports franchise has the ability to compete for entertainment dollars.</description>

      <description>Five for five.
The first five people who told me they supported Trump in 2015 also supported Ross Perot in 1992.
I realize it&amp;rsquo;s a tiny sample size. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that Donald Trump is the reincarnation of H. Ross Perot. Conservatives&amp;ndash;all conservatives and all center-right voters&amp;ndash;need to come to terms with that fact. We must also deal with the realities of the 2016 election and chooseÂ a strategy.</description>

If the free marketers neglect their duties to feed, protect, teach, and discipline capitalists, some well-meaning but inept government agency will impose itself into the parenting role, destroying the lives of everyone involved and wasting trillions of tax dollars (borrowed from future generations) in the process.</description>

Syed Farook and four or five others worked long hours in Farookâs San Bernardino garage for months leading up to a deadly Islamic terror attack last week.
Neighbors knew. They knew Farook and his Pakistani wife, Tashfeen Malik, were up to no good. But the neighbors said nothing until after the massacre at a center for the developmentally disabled.

      <description>Thanksgiving celebrates the Pilgrims&amp;rsquo; break from socialism.
Schools and textbooks avoid the topic, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth remembering. The Plymouth and Jamestown plantations were dying under &amp;ldquo;common store&amp;rdquo; approach. Only by establishing a free market did the settlers thrive.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of Kent Dillon&amp;rsquo;s excellent story of Thanksgiving, which you can continue reading in its entirety at The Mises Institute:
By Kent Dillon
 The celebration of Thanksgiving is a celebration of plenty and appreciation of the abundance that has characterized the free enterprise, individualistic, capitalistic systems of the US.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Lee Presser made a great point in this guest post, The Only Rule of Engagement Will Be Victory. As one commenter noted:
 This is the best analysis of the war on terror that I have read. If we do not fight to win, we shouldnât be in the fight. Winning the war on terror starts with 1) admitting there is a war on terror, 2) being willing to confront the enemy with force, 3) fighting to win the war rather than appease the enemy, and 4) do whatever it takes to protect Americans and their homeland.</description>

      <description>Guest Post by Lee Presser
When FDR sent the troops to fight World War 2, he sent them to win.Â Since 1945, the political class has not given Americaâs military that clear instruction when being sent to war.Â Political considerations have modified the goal of winning.Â In Korea, it was fight but do not anger the Chinese.Â In Viet Nam, it was fight but do not attack the enemy if they are standing on the other side of line drawn on a map.</description>

      <description>In the war on terror, youâre on our side or theirs.
Barack Obama announced that he will veto any attempt by Congress to require background checks of Syrian refugees in an attempt to weed out ISIS terrorists. The President&amp;rsquo;s allegiances are now clear.
I heard Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) say that we must ensure proper screening in the wake of last Fridayâs Islamic terrorist attack in Paris.
The House of Representatives is working on legislation to do just that: increase the likelihood that we will catch terrorist infiltraters before they reach American soil.</description>

Concerned Student 1950, the group that seized public ground for private use at the University of Missouri has a new concern today. It seems the kiddos are upset that ISIS deigned to steal the headlines by killing 120 to 150 people in Paris, wounding 200 others.</description>

      <description>When Jim Cramer asks a question, you know everything&amp;rsquo;s all boogered up.
The first hour of the GOP Presidential Debate from Colorado will go down as the first official event of the post-journalism world. The debate ended with John Harwood lying about the debate&amp;rsquo;s length. Having been an occasional guest of Larry Kudlow, I&amp;rsquo;m being nice. But the CNBC reporters couldn&amp;rsquo;t write a story for my high school newspaper.
On the substance of what the candidates said, this was the best debate so far.</description>

      <description>Maybe Ann Wagner&amp;rsquo;s the problem.
Rep. Ann Wagner (HA-64) is the House Majority Whip. Her job is to know how every GOP member will vote on bills and to cut deals until House leadership gets the numbers it wants.
It&amp;rsquo;s unfathomable that a majority whip would not have seen the Kevin McCarthy meltdown coming long before the House Republican caucus met to nominate a candidate for speaker. But many accounts suggest that the Republican House leadership thought McCarthy had the votes up to the moment he withdrew.</description>

Maybe I just want people to think I&amp;rsquo;m the kind of person who hates electoral politics. (We are all capable of being wrong about ourselves.)
I have to say, briefly, that this was the most encouraging Republican debate since . . . 1980? These are all serious people, and I&amp;rsquo;m including Trump. They all love America, and not just what they might get from America.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I missed this.
It&amp;rsquo;s the story of Marienthal Austria.
Marienthal was a town in Austria that thrived thanks to a single employer. When the flax millÂ went out of business in 1932, Marienthal&amp;rsquo;s population became mostly unemployed.
Thanks to Austria&amp;rsquo;s liberal unemployment programs that replaced up to 90 percent of income, no one in Marienthal plunged into economic poverty as a result of the mill&amp;rsquo;s closing. But spiritual poverty was another story.</description>

      <description>Why is government involved in marriage at all? Taxes.
Brian Bollmann makes an excellent point about same-sex marriage.
Brian points out in this post that marriage is not a matter for government; contract law is. Government&amp;rsquo;s only concern in the case of a marriage is with its contractual implications:
 At some point in the short history of the United States (and certainly after the Civil War), state governments stepped onto the wall of separation and began getting involved in the religious institution of marriage in the appropriate area of protecting the rights to property â especially that of women.</description>

I hear she&amp;rsquo;s losing a lot of support from Democrat Party insiders, at least in private. The DNC is meeting this week, and talk will likely surround an alternative Democrats can vote for.
While Republicans enjoy the Clinton meltdown, we might want to be careful what we wish for.
One of the GOP&amp;rsquo;s best hopes for the White House is voter enthusiasm. Republicans can&amp;rsquo;t wait to vote, Democrats dread it.</description>

      <description>A couple weeks ago, I published a simple game for political nerds. Assuming the next president must build a cabinet from current candidates for the Republican nomination for president, how would you assign candidates to cabinet positions.
This was meant to be a fun exercise for people who spend too much time thinking about politics. Like the leaders-eat-last poll, this required hide, often dissatisfying choices. As a result, only six people completed the exercise which took up to a half hour.</description>

      <description>If you lack a unique, differentiating value, your only play is price.
In business, you command the price play by being very, very big and very, very efficient. In presidential politics, you&amp;rsquo;re unique or you close up shop and go home. Commodities don&amp;rsquo;t win executive offices. Usually.

It&amp;rsquo;s 117 pages of Ronald Reagan&amp;rsquo;s humor.Think of that. A US president who could fill a book with jokes.
My cursory review shows that about 60 percent of the jokes are on Reagan himself. And another 20 percent are on Republicans.
Ronald Reagan knew that life is too short and too precious to waste it on anger and pride. Better to spend your days getting laughs.</description>

      <description>Note: This was written in August, 2015, during the Obama administration. Lamentations about the current state of affairs pertain to an era now past. Hope for the future, though, burns eternal.
 We yearn for civic character but satisfy ourselves with symbolic gestures and celebrity circuses. We perceive no greatness in our leaders, a new meanness in ourselves. Small wonder that each new election brings a new jolt, its aftermath a new disappointment.</description>

      <description>My friend ScottÂ OppeltÂ mentioned his complaint that the GOP has so many great candidates all at once. Why can&amp;rsquo;t they be spread out over 20 years?
Great question. History being what it is, we can&amp;rsquo;t spread them across time, only across government. So this week&amp;rsquo;s poll is a little fun.
The rules:
You must fill the next White House cabinet using only the current candidates for President. You do not know who the President or Vice President is, so assume it&amp;rsquo;s none of the current candidates.</description>

Did you know that a lot of other people are tired of your anger?
Did you know that 70 percent of Americans donât like politics?
Did you know that the 70 percent of Americans who donât like politics wonât vote for anything an angry person tells them to vote for?
Go look it up. Itâs totally true.
So many conservatives want another Reagan, but they want an angry, vengeful, belligerent Reagan.</description>

      <description>Thereâs a huge, important fiinding in a new pollâone I believe will affect a lot of elections nationally and in Missouri in 2016. In fact, 2016 will come down to one word.
Write down what you think that word is before reading on.
STLTPC vs. USA on President First, letâs look at some polls.
St. Louis Tea Party members see the GOP Presidential race a little differently than the country at large.</description>

The Empty See is in St. Louis.
The Metropolitan Taxicab Commission (MTC) is a racket to protect incumbent taxicab companies. They use their power to keep St. Louis in the stone age of transportation.
Itâs time to dissolve the MTC. It has served its purpose and outlived its usefulness. Like the riverboat commission of the 1850s.
Until then, I will do everything in my power to avoid taxis in St.</description>

      <description>The Transportation Empowerment Act gives states control and funding for their roads. It is a far superior to the Highway Trust Fund, which is slush fund for pork projects.
Transportation Empowerment Act (TEA) from Senator Mike Lee would gradually shift federal gasoline taxes from Washington back to the states where they were collected without a Washington DC handling fee and without strings attached.
TEA embodies an idea I first heard from Ronald Reaganwhen he was governor of California.</description>

This was not a controlled survey, so be careful what you read into it. Instead of using the poll as a measure of breadth, I recommend looking at from a few other angles.
Suspicious Voting Yes, there was a lot of suspicious voting. At least one candidate received his or her strongest support from a single data center in India.</description>

      <description>Greece&amp;rsquo;s parliament just signed its surrender to Germany. The country signed over virtually all of its national assets and all its future income for 30 years. No one believes Greece will make good on the agreement, and Greece didn&amp;rsquo;t want the deal. Germany demanded it, and Greece surrendered. But Greece will default at some point. Then what? Will Germany send its army? Probably.
In Washington, Barack Obama berated a skeptical press for questioning the agreement he reached with the world&amp;rsquo;s largest exporter of Islamic terrorism.</description>

 Good old Clausewitz. Best book on war ever written. (The Art of War was about something else.)
But the 21st century has reversed his famous line. Politics has become war by other means.
Germany has a history of waging wars of conquest. World War I. World War II. The Greek bailout. As Stratfor&amp;rsquo;s George Friedman explains:</description>

I was.
Sure, Iâd heard the rumors. The whispers spread by some Republican campaign operatives. But Iâve learned to trust those campaign operatives about as far as I fund the national debt.
Then, Senator John Lamping sent me a link to this Fox News story:

      <description>So how to reenergize the innovation diffusion machine? This is key: âA level playing field that does not favour incumbents over entrants. Many policy measures, from environmental to fiscal measures, are designed to favour incumbents.â More entry through startups and more exit by uncompetitive incumbents.
 &amp;ndash;JAMES PETHOKOUKIS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE
The Metropolitan Taxicab Commission is a crony club for taxi company executives and their hospitality friends, and its primary purpose is to kill transportation innovation and thwart price competition.</description>

Apparently, the politicians in St. Louis felt their duty was to protect the riverboat industry, at that time their life and blood, from any and all competition.</description>

      <description>Washington (APP) âIn a Rose Garden press conference today, President Barack Obama introduced Art Vandelay as his choice to head the troubled Export Import Bank for a five-year term, pending approval by the Senate.
The shake-up comes as Congress debates whether or not to extend the bankâs authorization amid heavy opposition from conservative and libertarian groups led by Heritage Action for America.
Mr. Vandelay brings almost 30 years of experience in the export-import business, where he tradedÂ in commodities as varied as potato chips, diapers, and matches.</description>

But if that step is in the wrong direction, you might end up 2,000 miles from your goal.
Many believe America took a step in the wrong direction long ago&amp;ndash;about the time &amp;ldquo;progressivism&amp;rdquo; became popular among political, business, and academic elites in the early 20th century.
If progressivism was a step in the wrong direction, it&amp;rsquo;s led us at least 2,000 miles from our target.</description>

 I believe this nation hungers for a spiritual revival; hungers to once again see honor placed above political expediency; to see government once again the protector of our liberties, not the distributor of gifts and privilege. Government should uphold and not undermine those institutions which are custodians of the very values upon which civilization is founded &amp;ndash; Faith, education and, above all, family.</description>

People say it like it&amp;rsquo;s a bad thing.
What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with the government not knowing that one bit of information about your private medical life? Can&amp;rsquo;t government keep out of at least this one, extremely personal matter?
The do-gooders and busy-bodies want Missouri to maintain a database (tied into similar databases in all other states) that keeps a permanent record of every prescription a doctor or dentist writes.</description>

Ben deferred to me to tell the Greitens story. I went through the usual, remarkable life of a man, eleven years my junior, a century my senior. I told him about Duke, boxing, Bosnia, Rwanda, Mother Teresa. I told him about boxing at Oxford and becoming a SEAL.

      <description>I was hungover.
I sat in a booth at the Holiday Inn in Quincy, Illinois, with my wife and two friends from St. Louis. The day before was my wife&amp;rsquo;s birthday, which she graciously spent waiting for me to speak at a tea party in Quincy.
Angela and I sat with Jim Durbin and Ben Evans. About four feet away, sitting at the bar, were Andrew Breitbart and editor-in-chief of Andrew&amp;rsquo;s BigGovernment.</description>

      <description>Note: Updated to remove reference to Jeff Roe
Poor Catherine Hanaway.
Her shadowy operatives worked so hard to defeatÂ Tom Schweich, but a new threat to Hanaway&amp;rsquo;s coronation emerged: Eric Greitens. (You can read all about Eric Greitens, here.)
The GOP establishment&amp;rsquo;s inept, new whisper campaign against Greitens is so amateurish and sad it evokes the kind of sympathy one feels toward the ignorance of animals (to paraphrase William F. Buckley).</description>

Leftist donors flooded Texas with money for two years.
Wendy Davis was the poster-child in 2014, but she was only a candidate of convenience. Leftists know that turning Texas purple would mean leftist dominationÂ in America. In 2013 &amp;ldquo;purple Texas&amp;rdquo;Â was all the talk. From Huffington Post:
 Last week,Â PoliticoÂ reportedÂ that national Democrats are creating a &amp;ldquo;large-scale independent group&amp;rdquo; aimed at turning Texas into a legitimate electoral battleground.</description>

      <description>Fate moves in mysterious ways.
Just days before State Auditor and Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Schweich died, Eric Greitens announced an exploratory committee. Greitens wants to test the water of a possible run for Missouri Governor as a Republican.
Greitens would be, perhaps, the most remarkable human being ever to pursue the office of Governor of Missouri. Hereâs a sampling of Greitensâs achievements:
 Humanitarian whoâs worked in Rwanda, Bosnia, Central America, India and other disaster zonesâusually man-made disaster zones Boxer who won championships in England Rhodes Scholar who completed the program at Oxford Navy SEAL who earned the Bronze Star among other accolades in four tours in Iraq Founder of The Mission Continues to give wounded veterans a mission and a purpose in life Time Magazineâs 100 most influential people in the world Forbesâ Magazineâs 50 greatest leaders in the world  Purpose Over Party Greitens is no ideologue.</description>

Did you know that?
(I probably knew it and forgot. Sorry.)
But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: THEY WON!!!!
Wait. YOU won. You won because Fred, Gretchen, and Anne stuck their necks out for you. And for me.
So Thank You! to Fred, Gretchen, and Anne. And this case seems really, really big.</description>

      <description>The last two years of Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s presidency will see the rise of a new Russian empire.
This new empire will resemble the Soviet Union in shape, the Czars in style.
We looked at this subject over the summer (here and here). To summarize those blogs:
 The US-led coup of Ukraine convinced Putin to reassert safer borders Russia wants to build a buffer between itself and NATO Putin wants to re-establish a Russian Empire to revitalize Russian pride and influence Western debt and war-weariness make NATO impotent Putin knows the next US president might be more of a manÂ than Obama, even if its Hillary Putin will want to complete his expansion by January 20, 2017 Ukraine is as good as done and Poland will fall under Russian influence  I still believe all of that.</description>

I hemmed and hawed and told her a story she probably didn&amp;rsquo;t want to hear. The best I could come up with was:
 I don&amp;rsquo;t trust the FCC or the Obama Administration to do anything honest I don&amp;rsquo;t trust the Republican establishment to do anythingÂ right  First, the Obama Administration would love to get control of internet content. They can already read every message, every keystroke anyone types anywhere.</description>

      <description>Why have conservatives and right-leaning libertarians made so little progress since 2009?
Consider that the GOP was written off for dead following the 2008 election. Republicans disappeared from the press. When a Republican popped up on a Sunday talk show, he was talking about compromise and getting along.
Then the Tea Party happened, and all of a sudden the GOP&amp;rsquo;s testes descended. But after two off-year wave elections that gave the GOP their largest majorities since Hoover, the GOP seems poised to double down on the crony capitalist, elitist policies and candidates that got them tossed out of Washington in 2006 and 2008.</description>

      <description>Do people become cops just so they can write speeding tickets?
According to the National Sheriffsâ Association, writing speeding tickets is a police officerâs noblest calling. People and technologies that help drivers drive more safely and obey the law interfere with that noble mission of revenue generation, and the NSA isÂ out to stop it.
According to the Associated Press,the National Sheriffsâ Association wants to crack down onÂ the popular traffic navigation app Wazeâ¢ so that people will drive faster and cops can write more tickets.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s some perspective:
 St. Louis County accounts for 22 percent of Missouri&amp;rsquo;s population and over 50 percent of traffic tickets St. Ann&amp;rsquo;s traffic court revenue exploded from about $500,000 in 2009 to over $3.5 million last year Traffic court generates 90 percent of the total revenue for one Missouri city Ferguson, Missouri, has three outstanding traffic ticket warrants for every citizen The mayor of Edmundson in North St.</description>

      <description>Work screwed up my plans.
Our annual St. Louis Tea Party / Heritage Action Christmas Party started at 6:00 in the evening on December 17. I knew Auditor Tom Schweich planned to attend, and I looked forward to seeing him.
About 3:00 the problems started. People scurrying to wrap up projects before the Christmas break led to errors, questions, and never-ending email threads.
I finally made it out of the office about 7:30 and arrived at Scarecrow in Chesterfield a little after 8:00.</description>

      <description>You might have noticed that my report on the Speaker election process lacked enthusiasm.
Now you know why.
Boehner is moving quickly to purge conservatives from all committees of meaning. He has vowed to cooperate with the White House and Democrats. He has vowed never to shut down government again, no matter how evil, onerous, or destructive of liberty government becomes.
Boehner has gone full native.
That&amp;rsquo;s a predictable outcome of a failed coup.</description>

For the record, I&amp;rsquo;d love to see the election go to a second, third, fourth, or ninety-fifth ballot. But I don&amp;rsquo;t expect Boehner to lose. And if Boehner should lose, Gohmert might not win. The winner will need a LOT of Republican votes, and Boehner supporters won&amp;rsquo;t vote for the guy who inserted himself into the race.</description>

What do police officer think about traffic ticket quotas? Here&amp;rsquo;s one officer&amp;rsquo;s thoughts:
 In my agency, those of us in patrol had to keep a &amp;ldquo;Daily.&amp;rdquo; This would be a formal document that showed the times, addresses where we went, written in code, of what we had done.
 On the back were boxes for how many traffic citations, criminal citations, parking citations and felony and misdemeanor arrests we had made on that day.</description>

      <description>The US House of Representatives is not a meritocracy. And that&amp;rsquo;s a shame.
House &amp;ldquo;leadership&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually have anything to do with leadership. It has everything to do with money.
In a story about the fall from power of Nancy Pelosi, Michael Barone describes how the House leadership process evolved from seniority to raw cash.
  For years, liberal Democrats had decried the seniority system, which automatically made conservative Southerners (and/or senile members) committee chairmen.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest with ourselves: President Obama&amp;rsquo;s unilateral, dictatorial action on immigration is not to benefit illegals. It&amp;rsquo;s to punish American voters for rejecting him.
This is personal.
In two years, the next American president will let this and many other Obama executive orders expire. Executive orders are not law. They expire with the term of the president who signed them. No future president is bound to renew them. And the next president won&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Governors
Republicans were supposed to lose governor seats. Instead, they picked up nine or ten. That&amp;rsquo;s huge, because governors become presidents. Executive leadership is different from coalition &amp;ldquo;leadership,&amp;rdquo; and governors are real executives. Look for the GOP&amp;rsquo;s gubernatorial wins to play big roles in 2016 and 2020.
This Morning (New York Times):
 Democrats seem to have their best shot in Florida, where the stateâs former Republican governor, Charlie Crist, is running as a Democrat against the Republican incumbent, Rick Scott.</description>

      <description>The White House and its corrupt Department of Justice has one chance to change the election&amp;rsquo;s outcome.According to Nate Silver&amp;rsquo;s FiveThirtyEight blog, the GOP has a 62.1 percent chance of a Senate majority. With nine days left until the election, andÂ with President Obama&amp;rsquo;s approval and likability plunging, the Democrats face a huge loss.
Apathetic Democrats Many political observers blame Democrat voter apathy, particularly among African-Americans. The black vote that swelled in 2008 and 2012 with Obama on the ballot shows signs of deflating in 2014 as it did in 2010.</description>

      <description>From about 1978 until the Monica Lewinsky fiasco, the GOP was called &amp;ldquo;the party of ideas.&amp;rdquo;Â I miss the ideas.
William F. Buckley helped. Buckley liked big ideas and smart people. He liked politicians who gave legs to great ideas and governors with the gutsÂ to experiment. Governor Ronald Reagan appeared on Buckley&amp;rsquo;sÂ Firing Line shortly after the Gipper became California&amp;rsquo;s governor.

      <description>Maybe this logic sucks, but this is my logic.Â When I vote, I ignore my positions on issues.Â Instead, I use my vote to advance two objectives:
*1. I want my vote to improve policy towards liberty. *2. I want my vote to maximize my political power.
A simple test that I ask myself is this: If I vote for A, do I expect resulting policy to be more or less to my liking?</description>

Missouri Republicans are FREAKING OUT that Speaker Apparent John Diehl could go down to defeat at the hands of conservative/libertarianÂ grassroots activists. The freak-out is over a press conference in Queeny Park at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, September 30.

I heard of the Stop Diehl project last week. On Saturday, mostly Republican volunteers began a door-to-door campaign in Diehl&amp;rsquo;s district to block re-election.</description>

      <description>When people asked me to get behind Rick Stream, I first wanted to make sure that was the right thing. I remembered that I have a friend whoÂ helped Rick a while ago. So I asked her.
Rick Stream is &amp;ldquo;a quiet leader.&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t see him as a politician,&amp;rdquo; she told me. We were talking about Rick Stream, the candidate for St. Louis County Executive.

      <description>Accountability? We don&amp;rsquo;t need no stinking accountability.
 No, Ann Wagner didn&amp;rsquo;t actually say that. But her comments to a 2nd District Republican committee meeting on Tuesday gave at least one attendee the impression that Mrs. Wagner opposes the idea of conservatives holding Congress accountable.
Ann Wagner Attacks the Conservative Heritage Action Rep. Ann Wagner accused the conservative Heritage Action for America of &amp;ldquo;pitting Republican against Republican&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;never attacking Dems&amp;rdquo; at the Republican meeting.</description>

      <description>Libertarians want to take over the world and leave you alone.
What a refreshing ambition!
A couple days ago, I wrote that I will not vote for Ann Wagner&amp;rsquo;s re-election in 2014. I arrived at that position after realizing that Mrs. Wagner and I share incompatible, mutually exclusive views on the proper relationship between government and people. She believes government should run markets. I believe government should make sure markets are fair.</description>

      <description>Why did the chicken cross the road?
 To get to the lame duck.
You can&amp;rsquo;t trust the GOP establishment.
In case you missed it, the House GOP leadership pushed a Continuing Resolution to fund government through December. Now, these same GOP leaders will tell you they expect Republicans to take over the Senate in January. So why would they give Harry Reid a chance to use the lame duck Congress in December to pass an Obama-friendly long term CR?</description>

      <description>Rep. Ann Wagner&amp;rsquo;s Heritage Action Score is a disappointing 59.Â It&amp;rsquo;s about to drop even lower.
Last week, the Republican from Missouri&amp;rsquo;s 2nd Congressional District came out strongly in support of cronyism by endorsing and vowing to fight for extending the Export-Import Bank.
From Wagner&amp;rsquo;s interview with National Public Radio:
 âThere is some talk about a short-term reauthorization, perhaps six or seven months on Ex-Im,â she said. âIâd like it to be longer than that.</description>

I am embarrassed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about this problem sooner. Or I heard about it and ignored it, which is even worse. Maybe I thought itÂ was just the usual liberal whining about trumped up racial problems. Whatever, I should have listened.
On September 2, I asked a room of about 30 tea partiers, &amp;ldquo;Do you trust our justice system?&amp;rdquo; I heard a chorus of &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Since the Post won&amp;rsquo;t run my reply a recent op-ed about the Ex-Im Bank, I&amp;rsquo;ll publish it here:
Huge multi-national corporations like to preach from the &amp;ldquo;small business&amp;rdquo; bible when it comes to the Export-Import bank. Unfortunately, most of the Ex-Im propaganda about how &amp;ldquo;small business&amp;rdquo; benefits crumbles under scrutiny.
Professor Stanford Levin of Southern Illinois University recently wrote an Op-Ed supporting reauthorization of the Export Import Bank. As the professor states, the Export-Import Bank provides cheap loans to foreign companies and governments with which to buy products sold by mostly large, multi-national companies with headquarters in the United States.</description>

      <description>Guest post by Lee A. Presser
On Wednesday, April 16, 2003, I was in Bel-Ridge, Missouri, Municipal Court to plead ânot guilty.â The violation listed on the ticket did not match the reality of what actually happened on the road. In a file folder, I had documents and photographs to rebut the charge. The ticket stated that Court convened at 6:30 P.M. I arrived twenty minutes early.
Before 9:30 that evening, I had been tightly handcuffed twice, verbally abused by police, pushed into a depressing detention cell, and made an example of in front of seventy-five to one hundred people.</description>

      <description>The next St. Louis County Executive better brace himself for this: poverty is exploding in the county.
I&amp;rsquo;m not saying poor people do bad things. I&amp;rsquo;m saying that, at some point, eliminating jobs and hope will drive people to take things. And they will take things by force. And they will show no mercy to anyone who tries to get in their way.
Right or wrong, it happens. And no militarized police force will stop it.</description>

      <description>Maybe the chickens are coming home to roost for the GOP in St. Louis County.
In my day job, I focus on two subjects: strategic behavioral science and analytics. Really smart people do most of the heavy analytics work. I deal with the human behavior (neuroeconomics, psychology, etc.). In our narrow field of loyalty and motivation, I think we&amp;rsquo;re the best in the business.

Today, Erick responded to widespread criticism of his decision to protect the GOP Chairman from questions about tactics in the Mississippi Republican Senate Runoff. Here&amp;rsquo;s the heart of Erickson&amp;rsquo;s answer:
 But there was more to it than me knowing people would be angry about Mississippi. First, many of the people told me what they wanted to ask Reince.</description>

      <description>Many Republican voters pulled a Democrat ballot August 5th, in St. Louis County. Having crossed over once, how many will do it again in November? It is no secret that the Republican legislature in Jefferson City has exhibited minimal leadership on major issues while spending most of a short legislative calendar talking about issues invented by lobbyists.
Republican voters expected more.
Many St. Louis County Republican voters are baffled by the absence of political âgutsâ displayed in Jefferson City.</description>

Welcome, Donald Trump fans! Thanks for reading.
Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s true, I have had disagreements with Erick in the past. I try to assess the situation, not just the person. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to disagree with someone on one subject and to agree with them on another.
If anything, Erick showed consistency by rescinding Trump&amp;rsquo;s invitation to Red State. Erick didn&amp;rsquo;t want the event to descend into chaos led by my friends over the Barbour episode; he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want a descent into chaos led by Donald Trump.</description>

      <description>Now that Amendment 7 has gone down in flames, let&amp;rsquo;s look at highway funding in Missouri.
Amendment 7 would have authorized a 3/4 cent sales tax increase in Missouri. The money was intended for transportation in the broadest sense of the word. Parks with dirt paths qualify, since people can walk on the paths. Even if the bill tightened down the definition of transportation, municipalities and counties would have merely shifted funds to other projects and replaced that money with Amendment 7 taxes.</description>

A few weeks ago, hunkered down at my laptop in my hotel room in Jacksonville, Florida. I was exhausted from seven hours of travel and a time change. But I had to take a moment to recognize Ed Martin&amp;rsquo;s commitment to all the best the Republican Party stands for.
Ed is determined to expose the GOP establishment&amp;rsquo;s willingness to do anything to destroy grassroots insurgents. Thad Cochran&amp;rsquo;s forces in Mississippi threw ethics, morality, and decency to the wind in their quest to stop a Tea Party candidate from unseating the 128-term Cochran.</description>

      <description>No time for deep analysis tonight, but there&amp;rsquo;s a small political earthquake in St. Louis County.
With over 90% of the precincts counted in the Missouri primary, incumbent Congresswoman Ann Wagner has only 500 more votes than her November challenger, Democrat Arthur Lieber.

I get that this is a primary and that the St. Louis County Executive race drew a lot of attention. But Wagner won her seat in 2012 by 20 points.</description>

Seriously. The president&amp;rsquo;s family has no more authority than anyone else. The reason people show contempt for activist spouses of presidents is the same reason history hates Marie Antoinette.
I know, the all-Democrat Congress passed the school nutrition law in 2010, but Michelle Obama wrote it.
Michelle Obama has dictated that no tasty foods may enter any school property.Â That ban includesÂ school bake sales and snack shops which has PTOs scrambling to replace lost income.</description>

Forgive me, but that was sort of a tease. Here&amp;rsquo;s the meat: Reagan wrote a proposal for the Republican Governors&amp;rsquo; Conference of 1967 to allow states to keep about 2 percent of allÂ federalÂ taxes raised in the state.</description>

Russian troops or Russian proxies murdered 293 people, today, including 23 Americans by many reports.
Israel was forced to invade Gaza to destroy tunnels Hamas uses to invade Israel and murder children.
The world teeters on the brink of all-out war.
But the President refused to cancel partisan fundraising efforts tonight.

      <title>Ashcroft Passes on Opportunity to Deny Medicaid Expansion Fix</title>

      <description>Last week, I wrote about the Missouri Republican Establishment&amp;rsquo;s plan to win a windfall for lobbyist Kit Bond via Senate candidate Jay Ashcroft. Not that the Establishment cares about Bond, but they want Medicaid expansion passed before they beg for money for 2016 from the Missouri Hospital Association and Chamber of Commerce.
Well, the St. Louis Post Dispatch asked Ashcroft about the deal, and he couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite bring himself to deny that he would pass Medicaid expansion if elected.</description>

      <description>Want to fix Missouri&amp;rsquo;s roads and cut taxes at the same time? Well, two American conservative icons showed us the way almost 50 years ago.
The Establishment likes to attack grassroots conservatives by claiming Reagan would have opposed the Tea Party. They&amp;rsquo;re wrong, of course, and the Transportation Empowerment Act tells us why.
In 1967, shortly after Ronald Reagan became governor of California, William F. Buckley Jr. asked Governor Reagan if was even possible to be an effective governor.</description>

   Over the past few days, I have reached out to many but not all of you about some of what MissouriRepublicans were asking about re Mississippi especially about the racially divisive ads run in support of Senator Cochran.
 Many of you gave me good advice, some were silent, and I got lots of input from Mississippi too.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s funny, really, that America celebrates the day we signed up to fight a brutal war for independence, not the day that war was won.
But I want to writeÂ about football.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always hated the Dallas Cowboys.
Cut me a little slack, though. I was a Big Red fan from childhood, and a season ticket holder from 1978 to 1983. (&amp;ldquo;Big Red&amp;rdquo; refers to the St. Louis Football Cardinals for those of you under 40.</description>

      <description>AÂ Pyrrhic victoryÂ is a victory with such a devastating cost that it is tantamount to defeat. Someone who wins a Pyrrhic victory has been victorious in some way; however, the heavy toll negates any sense of achievement or profit (another term for this would be &amp;ldquo;hollow victory&amp;rdquo;).

That&amp;rsquo;s the premise of Dinesh D&amp;rsquo;Souza&amp;rsquo;s new movieÂ America: Imagine theÂ world without her.Â (Find a theatre near you.)

Last Wednesday, my wife took Samantha, Jordan, and me to see the movie to kick off Independence Day weekend. Even without the movie, this July 4th was special for me. My son, Jack, re-enlisted in the US Navy on board the USS Missouri in Pearl Harbor.</description>

WARNING: Strong Language
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj6AXvkBnv4
What&amp;rsquo;s So Great About It? You have to love this American Army sergeant telling the Iraqi police how it is in strong language. Perhaps if the Iraqi police had listened, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be defending Baghdad against the Islamic State right now.
But they are.
I know some of you might object to this sergeant&amp;rsquo;s direct assault on these men&amp;rsquo;s manhood and character.</description>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;Red Death&amp;rdquo; had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its sealâthe rednessÂ and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stainsÂ upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men.</description>

      <description>What do we do with the plank?
Yesterday I wrote about a new political dichotomy in America. This new dichotomy supersedes or suspends all other political dichotomies: left vs. right, Democrat vs. Republican, etc. This new American political dichotomy is elites vs. plebeians.
Elites and Plebeians Think of elites as the people who donate lots of money and give lots of favors to the party in power in exchange for favors.</description>

      <description>Before we get to politics, I want to tell you about a business exercise.
The Universal Veto Game  Sometimes my job as a consultant involves helping people decide what to do when no ideas have a consensus. Sure, someone in a hierarchy can dictate terms, but dictated solutions don&amp;rsquo;t really work in business. Cooperation and collaboration are too important for success, and dictated terms are usually executed half-assed.
So we play this game.</description>

      <description>St. Louisan Eric Greitens did more before graduating from college than most people do in a lifetime. And, as if to insult us all, after college, Eric became a Navy SEAL.
In his remarkable book, The Heart and the Fist: The education of a humanitarian, the making of a Navy SEAL, Greitens tells the story of a man who seems too good to be true. Seriously. And the book left me with two big impressions&amp;ndash;probably the wrong ones, but that&amp;rsquo;s how I am.</description>

      <description>âShellacked!â
That was the word that stuck out to me.
Eric Cantor, the Republican House Majority Leader led by 34 points according to his pollster. He lost by 10. Thatâs a shellacking.
Eric Cantor was the first sitting House Majority Leader ever knocked off in a primary. CantorÂ was also one of Wall Streetâs best friends and the embodiment of crony capitalismâthe disease eating the heart out of the GOP.</description>

      <description>You know how reckless and tone-deaf Obama is about Army deserters? Missouri&amp;rsquo;s House and Senate Republican leaders are just as clueless and irresponsible about money.
Yes, I said it: the Missouri Republican legislature is about as conservative and principled as Susan Rice on a Sunday talk show.
By going on a votes-for-cash spending spree on the last day of the General Assembly, the House and Senate handed Jay &amp;ldquo;Idiot&amp;rdquo; Nixon a PR prize worth its weight in pork.</description>

      <description>A lot of good people I know grumble that the House Republicans don&amp;rsquo;t try to impeach Obama.
I usually don&amp;rsquo;t say much in response. After the disaster of the ill-conceived Clinton impeachment fiasco,** impeachment seems like a superstition**. Like a unicorn. I think impeachment is a dangerous tool and should never be used for political purposes.
Besides, Harry Reid&amp;rsquo;s Senate wouldn&amp;rsquo;t consider articles of impeachment if they included NSA video of Obama throwing adorable, drooling toddlers off the George Washington Bridge.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll give Business Insider some credit. After Tea Party-backed candidates came up empty across the board in Tuesday&amp;rsquo;s Republican primaries, the website that has spent years maligning our rule-of-law movement could have taken the low road.
Instead, blogger Brett Logiurato wrote a fair assessment of what&amp;rsquo;s happened to the GOP since February 27, 2009.
 The much-talked about Republican &amp;ldquo;civil war&amp;rdquo; is over, at least for the people who thought it even existed in the first place.</description>

      <description>In 1977, the National Socialist Party (Nazi) applied to march and rally in Skokie, Illinois. Few communities want Nazis marching down their streets, but Skokie held a stronger case against the Nazis than most towns in America. About one person in every six of Skokie&amp;rsquo;s large Jewish population was a Nazi prison camp survivor.
 The debate was clear-cut: American Nazis claimed the right of free speech while their Jewish &amp;ldquo;targets&amp;rdquo; claimed the right to live without intimidation.</description>

      <description>I hope you read Jonah Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s short article on National Review Online last week. If not, you missed the best definition of Establishment Republicans EVER!
Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s piece also exploded the myth of &amp;ldquo;pro-business&amp;rdquo; way too many conservatives believe. Conservatism isn&amp;rsquo;t pro-business, it&amp;rsquo;s pro-market. I&amp;rsquo;ll let Jonah explain:
 Just to clarify, the difference between being pro-business and pro-market is categorical. A politician who is a âfriend of businessâ is exactly that, a guy who does favors for his friends.</description>

During the Bundy Ranch standoff in Nevada, the Bureau of Land Management set up &amp;ldquo;free-speech zones.&amp;rdquo; I prefer to call them &amp;ldquo;First Amendment pens.&amp;rdquo;
The government uses these pens to segregate people. The US government says, &amp;ldquo;If you want to speak your mind, you may do so only within the pen.</description>

In his post, Taleb argued that the Second Amendment means nothing because the federal government has massively superior firepower:</description>

A young man named Adam Weinstein recently called for incarceration of disbelievers in the cult of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming (CAGW).

I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get better, though. One practice I&amp;rsquo;ve developed and recommend to everyone is pretty simple but difficult.</description>

Apparently, Obama didn&amp;rsquo;t bow low enough to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. Whatever happened, an &amp;ldquo;intimate&amp;rdquo; evening planned for Obama and Abdullah was abruptly cancelled after a two-hour meeting between the two leaders. A meeting intended to &amp;ldquo;mend fences&amp;rdquo; between the two men.

      <description>This morning, a White House aide told reporters that Obamaâs sanctions are visibly âweakeningâ Putin and Russia.
Hours later, the White House recognizes that Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine could come any moment.
 Speaking from the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, Mike Rogers, the chair of the House of Representatives intelligence committee, said US intelligence officials were convinced âthat Putin is not done in Ukraineâ.
 Surprise. As Iâve written, Russian paranoia demands a larger sphere of influence and a large buffer of puppet governments, all the way to the German border with Poland.</description>

      <description>You saw Obama stand by as you threatened Georgia in 2009.
You heard Obama whisper to Medvedev that heâll be willing to defy Congress to capitulate to you after Obamaâs re-election.
You watched Obama and his bumbling Secretary of State mangle its its own strategy in Syriaâif the US ever had a Syrian strategy at all.
You saw that the US was completely unprepared for your annexation of Crimea.
You see the headlines of massive NSA spying on US citizens, though that same NSA was blind to your invasion of Ukraine.</description>

      <description>Ask yourself this: why did the stock markets rally todayÂ afterÂ Obama announced sanctions against Russians? I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to that, but first some background.
I&amp;rsquo;ve often said that Putin plays chess while Obama fumbles with checkers. I picture our president, chin resting on fist, brows squeezed in childlike concentration, as he carefully chooses between jumping Putin&amp;rsquo;s piece to end the game or getting another of his pieces &amp;ldquo;kinged.&amp;rdquo;
Of course, Obama goes for the kingship.</description>

Do you sometimesÂ think anybody would do a better job than the incumbent? Do you feel you have no influence in Jefferson City, Springfield, or Washington? Do you feel that way because you don&amp;rsquo;t have thousands of dollars to donate and rich friends with oodles ofÂ cash you can bundle?
I feel that way all the time. Ask my friends Ben Evans and Michelle Moore.</description>

      <description>If you were out on the Arch steps on February 27, 2009, take a moment to consider what&amp;rsquo;s happened.
** From near-spontaneous reaction to bailouts, corporate takeovers, and profligate government spending emerged the largest and most sustained political movement since the 1960s ** Both the GOP and Democrat Party are minority parties, as independents have surged ** A new generation identifies with libertarian ideals like freedom from government spying, freedom from failed wars on activities war was never meant to stop, insane spending, the opaque and manipulative Federal Reserve, government manipulation of information, IRS abuse of political groups, and Obamacare.</description>

      <description>Give all due credit to Rick Santelli. His rant inspired a movement.Â But words don&amp;rsquo;t wear boots.
More images like this one available at Doctor Bulldog: https://doctorbulldog.wordpress.com/2009/02/27/st-louis-tea-party-by-the-arch/  At 7:00 pm on February 20, Mike Leahy, Eric Odom, Jenny Beth Martin, Michelle Moore, Brooks Bayne, and a few others hijacked the TCOT conference call to answer Santelli&amp;rsquo;s call for a Tea Party in Chicago.
Two days after that, I posted this on Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View:St.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t know what got me onto this, exactly. I talked to Jim Durbin tonight, so maybe that was it.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for video of a speech I gave at the Million Med March in Clayton, MO, in 2009.Â Two-friggin-thousand-and-nine. (I&amp;rsquo;m a quarter German, so I hold a grudge.)

      <description>I stand by my assessment that Chris Christie&amp;rsquo;s leadership and management played a role in the retaliatory shutdown of Fort Lee&amp;rsquo;s access lanes to the George Washington Bridge. Yesterday,I compared the GWB scandal to several Obama scandals. I pointed out that conservatives must apply the same standards to Christie as we did to Obama when the IRS scandal broke.
Today, let&amp;rsquo;s look at Christie&amp;rsquo;s response and contrast it to Obama&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Last week&amp;rsquo;s Weednesday Post generated several comments that took my side but the facts wrong. Specifically, a couple of commenters claimed &amp;ldquo;marijuana is harmless.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s not true.
While cannabis may be have fewer harmful effects than alcohol and tobacco, someone who abstains from all three will be healthier mentally and physically than the same person smoking pot.
On the other hand, a lot proponents of prohibition throw around bad science, too.</description>

      <description>I blog about tea party stuff 90 percent of the time. I get decent readership with those blogs, and I appreciate my loyal followers. Very much.
But as long as I write about stuff only conservatives and activist libertarians care about, only conservatives and libertarians will read my blog. That means our ideas won&amp;rsquo;t escape the echo chamber we&amp;rsquo;ve been yelling in for years.
When I write about the conservative/libertarian perspective on issues of wider interest, though, I bring in people who never otherwise readÂ our views.</description>

Remember Leon Spinks? He beat Muhammad Ali. Then he got arrested a bunch, gained a lot of weight, and lost to Ali a few months later. He was pretty much done. And Ali was like 50 when Spinks lost to him.
Spinks had the whole world served up on a plate. He tried to eat it all at once. He choked on it.</description>

      <description>I nearly killed my nephew, Scott, when he was about seven-years-old. I was 15 or so.
We were at Sunnen Lake near Potosi, Missouri. My dad worked at Sunnen Products, and the company provided Sunnen Lake as a free recreation spot for employees and retirees. (Pretty cool perk.)
The recreation complex was pretty rustic then. About ten cabins, a recreation hall with ping-pong and a huge fireplace. The big parking lot near the Rec Hall was covered with pea-size brown and tan gravel held in place by an eight-inch railroad tie wall.</description>

To the MillennialsÂ of America,
All you sniveling, whining, crybaby MillennialsÂ need to quit your complaining and get signed up with Obamacare as soon as possible.
We really donât care what it costs you. I am retired now and drawing my Social Security and will sign up for Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and any other Social program available, as soon as I can qualify. I&amp;rsquo;m entitled, you know!</description>

Well, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want toÂ be him. I wanted to be the next one.
Every day, I wrote a 750-word piece. Poorly. I believed that practice would improve my writing.
It didn&amp;rsquo;t.
One day, I realized, as long as I tried to be the next William F. Buckley, I was destined for frustration and failure.</description>

      <description>I can be pretty hard on Republicans. Not hard enough for some. Too hard for others.
But I, at least, try to time my battles for ideological consistency. As a general rule, odd-numbered years are for cleaning up the GOP. Even-numbered years are for cleaning out Democrats.
This is an odd-numbered year. Right up to the votes on the continuing resolution,my primary targets were Republicans, especially Roy Blunt.
Once the House exercised its Constitutional power of the purse strings, sending a popular continuing resolution to the Senate, the battle lines shifted.</description>

      <description>Yeah, I know. Obama&amp;rsquo;s childish, petulant, and tyrannical tantrums over the continuing resolution makes me want to fight like an angry cat, too.
But I don&amp;rsquo;t actually want to fight. Fighting isn&amp;rsquo;t in our interest. As Sun Tzu said:
 Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is notÂ supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy&amp;rsquo;sÂ resistance without fighting.
 I want to succeed in repealing Obamacare and forcing government into its constitutionally limited box.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to offerÂ anything.&amp;rdquo; Barack Obama on why he&amp;rsquo;s shutting down the government.
Obama keeps forgetting he&amp;rsquo;s not a dictator. Or maybeÂ I keep forgetting he is.
[caption id=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;441&amp;rdquo;] Democrat Speaker Tip O&amp;rsquo;Neill shut down the government 12 times.[/caption]
Did you see that list of government shutdowns?
1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1990, 1995.

      <description>I was wrong.
As the continuing resolution fight approached, I expected House Republicans to cave. I expected Boehner to make a half-hearted attempt to use debt ceiling, instead of continuing resolution, as leverage to stop Obamacare. And I expected Republican Senators to make a stand.
But that&amp;rsquo;s not what happened.
In reverse order, Senate Republican leadership ran away from confrontation like schoolgirls spying a snake. Led by Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, and Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Junior Senator Roy Blunt, the GOP attacked Senators Mike Lee and Ted Cruz instead of Obamacare.</description>

      <description>Imagine how isolated Roy Blunt must feel.
Senator Blunt is a party man. He believes in following leadership. He doesnât rock the boat.
And his leader, Senate Minority Leader Slick Mitch McConnell, has decided to help Harry Reid get the 60 votes needed to invoke cloture on the continuing resolution. Once debate closes (via cloture), Reid will strip the Houseâs defund language from the bill and pass it.
Senate Republican leadership wants defund language stripped.</description>

      <description>Harry Reid needs six Republicans to fund Obamacare.Â Mitch McConnell signed up immediately.
In a statement, McConnell announced he plans to vote against Obamacare by voting for cloture, allowing Harry Reid to strike the defunding language from the bill.
McConnell will, of course, vote nay on the final bill. But that&amp;rsquo;s just a gimmick.
McConnell&amp;rsquo;s slick maneuver is short-sighted. It will bite him.Â  Slick Mitch knows as well as anyone that Obamacare is a disaster for the American people.</description>

      <description>I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d have to ask.
In Nairobi, Kenya, al Qaeda terrorists stormed an upscale mall yesterday to kill all the Christians.So far, 59 are dead and at least 175 wounded. Another 30 or so hostages remain inside with the terrorists.Kenyan police are hunting the terrorists and attempting to free the hostages.
The USA, surely, is on the side of the Kenyan authorities. Right?
Well, last week, President Obama waived (aka, violated) a US law that prohibited the arming of terrorists and terrorist-linked groups.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as a perfect candidate.
So quit waiting for one, and quit staying at home and casting a protest vote.
We need your help. Who are we you ask? The voters who have been getting their asses handed to them. We have about a hundred years of making up to do and we need to get started with a strategy.
If we can elect a candidate that we agree with:</description>

      <description>_Historic Veto Session leaves Missourians frustrated. _
Why is it that we expect more from elected public servants than from ourselves? We demand and expect them to stand up, sometimes alone, in a chamber full of their peers and fight for us, yet we don&amp;rsquo;t do it in our own communities!
When we get frustrated with our elected representatives in Jefferson City (and Washington) who don&amp;rsquo;t stand up for us, our knee-jerk response is to try to elect someone else in their place and hope that new representative will listen to us.</description>

      <description>Are you ready for Americaâs first Clothing Czar?
According to RightQuestion.org, this person, âwill decide what you will wear every day for the next four years.
If youâre a Goth, what if the Czar disallows Goth? What if heâs an 80s fan and orders collars up?
What other questions do you have for the new Clothing Czar?
The good news: you can vote for the Clothing Czar of your choice.</description>

      <description>John Kerry isnât fit for Secretary of State, and the whole world knows it.
If Obama every had a strategy for Syria, John Kerry destroyed it in a matter of minutes Monday.
First, Kerry said any American response to unspeakable humanitarian crisis in Syria would be âunbelievably small.â Man, you know that fired up the Marines floating off the coast of Syria. I can see them, Mae Wests on, ready to charge the beach, hearing that dreadful command: âFix bottle rockets!</description>

      <description>Obama pitched war to a war-weary America, and all he got back was a yawn.
Tonightâs speech was touted as the most important of his life. I doubt many will remember in 3 years.
âI have asked Congress to find something else to do for a couple of weeks,â seemed to be the theme. Or âthereâs something wrong with you people for wanting to bomb a Middle East country. I mean, theyâre Muslims for Godâs sake.</description>

      <description>Eric Cantorâs latest tactic in the battle to defund Obamacare reminds me of the Trojan Rabbit in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
According to Business Insiderâs Josh Barro:
 It&amp;rsquo;s a strategy predicated on the idea that Republican activists are stupid. Many of them are stupid. But they&amp;rsquo;re not stupid enough to fall for this.
 (Barro is hard-left, btw.)
From what I can gather, Cantor intends to pass two continuing resolutions out of the House.</description>

      <description>The White House admits it has no hard evidence that the Syrian government launched the alleged chemical weapons attack.
Instead, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough told the Associated Press âa common sense testâ implicates the Syrian government.
Well, no, it doesnât. Quite the opposite, in fact.
Chemical weapons attacks are signs of desperation. But Assadâs forces have recently gained the upper hand against rebels according to numerous sources.</description>

      <description>I got four emails from Republican candidates today. They all sucked.
Iâve made every mistake they made, so I wonât beat anyone up over it.
But if conservative candidates want to win elections, they have to becomeâor hireâexcellent marketers.
Everybody freaks out about the Democrat advantage in data, analytics, and social. But 80 percent of that gap is good execution of scientifically established marketing principles.
Republicans tend to despise marketing. They reject psychology.</description>

      <description>War is too damn serious to fight in half-measures or for a president&amp;rsquo;s pride.
And I am sick of American troops leaving our shores filled with vigor and ambition and hope only to return disillusioned, scarred, maimed, or dead.Â On this, left and right are beginning to agree.
Here are just some of the wars we fought half-assed in my lifetime:
 Vietnam El Salvador/Nicaragua Libya Iraq I Iraq II Afghanistan  By âhalf-assed,â I mean sending troops into harms way with no better purpose than to stop fighting on some arbitrary date and time.</description>

And Iâve defended conservativesâblindly at times. Iâve publicly defended policies I privately considered stupid.
All in the name of advancing my agenda. I believedâand still believeâthe liberty agenda is the best one. The only one for people live out the full potential of their lives, to own their own lives, and to leave the world better than they found it.</description>

Nancy Pelosi, too.
But I don&amp;rsquo;t.
I don&amp;rsquo;t believe the US has irrefutable, indisputable proof that the Syrian government intentionally killed 1,500 people with sarin gas.
I don&amp;rsquo;t believe it.
Not yet.
And neither does Yossef Bodansky.
You&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking &amp;ldquo;this Bodansky guy&amp;rsquo;s some conspiracy kook, too.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>The House GOP leadership has a problem.
The conservative base wants Boehner to use the continuing resolution to force a showdown over Obamacare. Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin, Sean Hannity, and millions of grassroots activists want the GOP to block passage of a continuing resolution because it funds the unpopular healthcare law.
Boehner doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to. He&amp;rsquo;s afraid that shutting down the government will hurt Republicans in the 2014 election.
Boehner could be right.</description>

The problem is, I didnât know whether or not it was effective.</description>

      <description>Iâll let one of my favorite thinkers, St. Louis native Don Peppers, tell about St. Louis in 1850:
 My hometown of St. Louis, Missouri was the largest city west of the Mississippi River in 1850, and the second largest port city in the entire country. Only New York handled more tonnage than the riverboats that docked, often more than a hundred at a time, at the St. Louis levee. Among other things, the riverboats supplied equipment, people, horses, and other materials to a burgeoning population of pioneers who rode wagon trains out from St.</description>

      <description>Iâm not a lawyer. And Iâm not particularly smart. But that doesnât stop me from writing my opinion.
Rather, Iâm a libertarian-ish conservative. I like a small central government that protects us from evil people in other countries and delivers mail. And prosecutes people who do great harm across state lines.
The Supreme Court has two big gay marriage cases pending. At issue:
  Do the people of California have the right to define marriage in their state?</description>

I looked around the silent sales room. No one blinked. They were all stunned.

      <description>The police in Watertown responded magnificently. But the most brilliant strategic move gets little notice from the press.

For about sixteen hours, hundreds of law officers, FBI agents, helicopters, and satellites scoured a relatively tiny area of Boston suburbs for one wounded terrorist. At the same time, they kept the public relatively safe, off the streets, and out of the way of their manhunt.
**But they didnât find their man.</description>

Yesterday, RNCÂ communications director, Sean Spicer, told Breitbart that Shields didn&amp;rsquo;t mean what we all heard him say. (You gotta see Mike Leahy&amp;rsquo;s excellent overage of this story, btw.)

Thatâs how Rep. Ann Wagnerâs (R-MO) described her opposition to any attempts by the US government to seize retirement accounts or bank deposits.
Hereâs the full quote: âI am solidly behind this resolution and over my dead body will the USG ever raid our personal savings or retirement accts!!â

      <description>The RNCâs Autopsy report wants to do away with caucuses and conventions, replacing them with regional primaries. But Iâll propose a different reform that will make candidate selection more interesting, whether in a caucus or a primary.
A Word About The Autopsy The idea of compacting the primary season and eliminating caucuses has some merit, but also a lot of downside. On the plus side are splashier events to showcase the party, fewer Tuesdays littered with politics, and, believe it or not, some economies as candidates can focus on one geographical region at a time.</description>

Americans Believe In Federalism In polls, Americans are consistent: the US government must not impose its morals on states regarding marijuana.

      <description>The GOPâs self-examination on the 2012 election debacle rightly identifies marketing and messaging and lack of a ground game as contributors to that mess.

But the GOPâs self-exam missed a potentially fatal problem for the party: the American people simply do not trust Republicans on the budget.
Read this paragraph from The Hill carefully. Read all of it. It should tell you everything you need to know.
 More voters trust the Democratic Party than the Republican Party on budgetary issues, according to the results of a new poll for The Hill â even though a strong majority actually prefer Republican fiscal policies [emphases added].</description>

They compromise, and she gets one implant.
Is this the best outcome?
No!Â Itâs the worst possible outcome. Either of the two other outcomesâno implants or twoâwould be better than the compromise.
So why are Americans so infatuated with political compromise that leaves the country more lopsided?

Those were the words of Missouri State Senator Kurt Schaefer to Director of Revenue Brian K. Long in a heated hearing at the Missouri State Capitol this morning.

Senator Schaefer and researchers at the Missouri Family Network, who broke this story, learned prior to the hearing that Longâs department has ordered Missouri fee office workers to violate state law by collecting and storing personal identifying information (PII) on everyone who renews a driverâs license, non-driver ID, or concealed carry permit in Missouri.</description>

      <description>A lot. Marijuana prohibition costs enough to put more than 900 new police officers on the streets.
Hereâs the numbers from Harvard and Cato scholar Jeffrey A. Miron and marijuana law reform researcher Abhi Sivasailam (via Show-Me Cannabis):
 Missouri would save about $90 million in government expenditure and yield roughly $59 million in tax revenue annually. This assumes that marijuana would be taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco and that all other states and the federal government would also legalize.</description>

      <description>Jennifer RubinâWaPoâs token conservativeâsaid it perfectly:
 McCain lost his cool with Rand Paul and sounded like the old man down the street screaming to the new kids on the block, âGet off my lawn!â
 The real reason McCain and Lindsey Graham embarrassed themselves on the floor of Senate had nothing to do with what Rand Paul said. Rand Paul&amp;rsquo;s ideas terrify McCain, Graham, and most of the Republican establishment.</description>

2009: 59% Conservative 
 2012: 57% Conservative 
With almost 60% calling themselves somewhat or very conservative, how could Barack Obama get re-elected? How could Republicans fail to gain the Senate in 2010 and 2012? Come to think of it, how do Democrats win at all?
The answer is simple: being conservative doesnât make you Republican, but being Democrat makes you a liberal.</description>

      <description>**If Republicans want to put their liberty where their mouths are, they can begin by ending the war on weed. **
When I was a kid in South St. Louis in the 70s, marijuana was the weed in the field that separated traditional post-war American values from the hippies. It was an easy black-and-white issue: smoke dope, youâre un-American. It was the Boomers against the Greatest Generation, and no one questioned the pure evil of pot.</description>

      <description>I agree with Republican Senator Corker that inflation is a danger in the future. But inflation doesnât win the hearts and minds of most Americans right now. No oneâs worried about it except economists and economics geeks.
The death of the community and regional bank, however, does bother people. As does the printing of money that goes straight into the 5 biggest banks in history . . . and stays there.</description>

      <description>First, I understand that some Republicans who donât regularly read my blog were confused (and unhappy) about my âProstitutes in Business Suitsâ slogan for the Missouri Chamber of Commerce (and other business organizations that stop being conservatives when government moneyâs dangled before their eyes). Well, grow up, Republicans. (Have you ever listened to Rush Limbaugh?)
Now to the meat of the story.
On Friday, two people contacted me. Urgent stuff.</description>

      <description>Every election cycle millions of reliable Republican voters die and even more millions of Democrat voters get the vote. Messaging and pandering wonât fix the problem. Reforming the party might.
Libertarian reforms offer the best hope, because all the other conservative factions â evangelicals, Second Amendment, home schoolers, fiscal &amp;ndash; have hit their high-water marks. We saw that in 2012. Liberty, however, sells with the kids. Or it might, if Republicans would try it.</description>

      <description>You probably never heard of Lance Beshore of Joplin, MO. Heâs been Missouriâs delegate to the Republican National Committeeâs Rules Committee for 12 years. He runs the lobbying department of Leggett &amp;amp; Platt furniture company. Heâs on the Missouri Chamber of Commerce, and heâs chairman of the board of Freeman Health Systems.

In his roles at Freeman and the Missouri Chamber, Beshore advocates for Obamacare Medicaid Expansion in Missouri.</description>

      <description>Why would the Missouri Chamber of Commerce want to expand Obamacare in Missouri? Short-sighted pursuit of money.

The Missouri Chambermaids of Cronyism Hereâs the simple truth: the Missouri Chamber of Commerce is not conservative. It does not exist to advance limited government and fiscal responsibility and free enterprise capitalism. The Missouri Chamber of Commerce has become convinced that it must lie down before government and beg for scraps from the federal table.</description>

      <description>In a blow to the old guard establishment,** the Missouri Republican State Committee elected Ed Martin Jr. as its new party chairman**.

Roy Blunt and all six Republican members of Congress from Missouri lobbied the new state committee over the past few weeks to block Ed and retain the establishmentâs choice, David Cole. Jo Mannies of the St. Louis Beacon wrote:
 Coleâs loss appears to be a setback for Missouriâs GOP establishment.</description>

      <description>William F. Buckley proposed a simple tax reform in 1973. The language barrier that separates people like Buckley from that odd species we call Congress prevented his thoughts from finding fertile soil. And in the 40 years between, the tax code has become only murkier and more dangerous.

âOur tax laws were,â Buckley wrote in _Four Reforms: A Guide for the Seventies, â_designed historically to raise revenue for the operations of government.</description>

      <description>Youâll need a scorecard to keep up with the insanity in Washington this week.

The Senateâs been a lost cause for a while, so letâs not even bother with the upper house. Besides, itâs really hard to focus on good fiscal policy while Hooterâs Girls are passing out Bacardi 151 shots, Buffalo wings, and âWelcome 2013â horns in the cloak room.
Over in the House, things looked interesting for a while.</description>

      <description>When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for conservatives to divorce themselves from superstitions theyâve embraced since the Progressive Movement of the 1920s and join the pantheon of reasonable people, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
I hold these truths to be totally frigginâ obvious, that all drugs are not created equal, that weâve wasted billions of dollars and millions of lives pursuing a** demented âzero toleranceâ temperance goal that was Never Going To Happen**, that the losses weâve endured trying stamp out weed have cost American society more than they&amp;rsquo;ve gained, that among these losses are lives, money, and opportunity.</description>

Yesterday, Boehner tried to land about halfway between the top and bottom quadrant on the left, shown here

Now that Plan B has been rejected, Boehnerâs choices are limited to these: * Adjourn and hit the fiscal cliff * Cut a deal that will earn most Democrat votes and enough Republican votes to pass</description>

We all know how that worked out.
It doesnât matter how right you are if youâre powerless.Right now we are.
Satisfied?
I didnât think so.

After four years of 5,000 Leap and Constitution study groups, of Constitutional workshops, and rallies in the park, letâs make a vow to ourselves and to each other: Weâre Done With Losing.</description>

But heâs been my boxing hero since childhoodâwhen he won the gold at the Olympics. Iâm sure thereâs another moment of glory waiting to explode on an unsuspecting world.
He just needs to land that one magical right.

      <description>In an open Republican primary in Missouriâs 8th Congressional District, a solid conservative would beat an establishment &amp;ldquo;my turn&amp;rdquo; Republican, hands down. And the Missouri GOP would hate it.
Thatâs why I smell a rat. Would you be surprised to learn that Jo Ann Emerson and Lloyd Smith had this switcheroo planned months ago?Â You have to admit that the timing is suspicious:
 * Emerson wins a certain re-election * Smith announces he&#39;s stepping down as Missouri GOP Executive Director * Emerson announces she&#39;s resigning to become Queen of Lobbyists * Missouri&#39;s GOP Establishment breaks hips to tell reporters &amp;quot;Lloyd Smith&#39;s our man!</description>

      <description>Encouraging Boehner to shut down the government is the surest way to end conservatism as a practical political alternative.
The GOP has no leverage in budget negotiations, and conservative denial wonât change that.
Use Game Theory As I wrote on November 12, fighting Obama â voting down a budget in the House â results in the GOPâs worst possible outcome: total blame for anything that goes wrong and no credit for anything that goes right.</description>

      <description>I wrote yesterday that if you need someone to blame, blame me. Donât blame bogeymen.

Yes, vote fraud is real. Voter rolls in most states need to be cleaned up. Voter intimidation should be harshly prosecuted.
You can sign up at True the Vote or Missouri Precinct Project to take effective, useful action. These organizations do vital work, and they both need more volunteers.
Using vote fraud, however, as an excuse for secession or for blocking the Electoral College vote is neither effective nor useful.</description>

Unions destroy themselves like pathetic drunks, dragging down everyone around them.

In a fine example of anti-strategic thinking and un-game theory, the Bakers Union put 637 of its members out of work yesterday.
Hostessâmakers of Twinkiesâis bankrupt. Part of the bankruptcy involved rewriting union contracts to allow the company to stay in business.
Instead of taking one for the team and helping their company crawl out of its fiscal hole, the Bakers went on strike.</description>

      <description>We heard it repeatedly during the Iraq wars: air power alone cannot win. You must take and hold ground in war.

The same is true in political combat. For years the GOP upset Democrats at all levels through superior ground games. Typically, this process involves:
 * Identifying potential voters * Contacting the high-value targets * Registering the unregistered * Mobilizing them on election day  Karl Roveâs Crossroads PACs tried a different strategy this time.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s the scam. Only 42 votes have been counted in a country of 150 million registered voters. In other words, it&amp;rsquo;s crap. No responsible news organization would post such misleading nonsense&amp;ndash;except in hopes of discouraging Romney voters.</description>

      <description>Yes, Iâm feeling a wave toward Romney.

My gut tells me this year is a lot like 1980.
1980 Was A Dead Heat
The final Gallup poll that year had a dead heat. Time Magazineâs November 3, 1980, called the race a dead heat. So did Newsweek.
The press was hoping John B. Anderson, a former Republican Congressman running for president as an independent, would siphon votes from Reagan. He did siphon votes from Reagan, but not nearly enough.</description>

      <description>If you canât find full-time work, blame Obamacare.

One reason the Middle Class has shriveled and wages shrunk over the the past four years is underemployment. People want full time work, but settle for anything. And anything is usually part time.
Most of the fantastic new jobs created since the 2009 have been part-time jobs.
According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 14.6% of Americans want a full-time job but settle for part-time.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s What To Do Today And On Election Day
Tuesday is the most important election of your life, but voting is never enough. You can have a bigger impact by using social proof to increase your influence. I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you how, and it won&amp;rsquo;t take you long.
First, though, make sure nothing gets in the way of exercising your duty to vote.
Studies have shown that you are more likely to vote if you answer these questions before Election Day:</description>

      <description>Barack Obama ridiculed George W. Bush for Katrina.

As people starve and beg for water in Rockaways, Obamaâs promises to create heaven on earth through government look foolish and born of ignorance.
Obama believes that government can solve any problem, large or small. But his FEMA canât get water to people in New York City.
With election two days away, remember this, you Obama voters: the most activist president of all time was unable to feed, clothe, and house hurricane victims despite having a week of warning.</description>

This is an email to encourage you to remember to do all you can to get Ed Martin elected Attorney General of Missouri. I know there are a lot of races and it is easy sometimes to overlook some of the down-ticket offices. But the Attorney General is an extremely important office. He is the chief law enforcement official of the state. He is responsible for seeing to it that our laws are faithfully enforced and our constitutional rights protected.</description>

      <description>Gallup released its early voting poll today, and it shows Mitt Romney winning 52% to 45%âright in line with their Likely Voter poll numbers. Hereâs the chart.

Politico Reporter Canât Read But Gallupâs section on early voting by party ID completely lost Politicoâs Kevin Robillard.
Robillard looked at the chart that shows when voters intend to vote by party and candidate and mistook it for voting results. This poll question shows that those who support Obama as as likely to vote early as are those who support Romney.</description>

      <description>The fog of war is lifting from Benghazi, and what lies beneath should shame Obamaâs most ardent supporters. Barack Obama choked, and Americans died.

When America came under attack, Obama panicked and froze.
When Americans under his direction pleaded for their lives, he was afraid to pull the trigger.
Hereâs the emerging picture.
White House Ordered Military and CIA to Stand Down and Let Al Qaeda Kill Former Navy SEALs Ty Woods and Glen Doherty, so disgusted by the White Houseâs refusal to help Americans under attack, defied an order to stand down.</description>

Maybe theyâve read about socialism, seen the movies, and heard about it from their college professorsâya know, like the one who actually visited the old Soviet Union.
But those sources give only an intellectual view of socialism. You canât actually _feel _it. And life, in the end, is about feelings.</description>

      <description>Polls do influence elections. Thatâs why people like Nate Silver and some of the writers at Business Insider are doing somersaults over Gallupâs Daily Presidential Tracking numbers.

For over a week, Gallup has shown a tidal wave for support for Mitt Romney. Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight tried to discredit Gallup by blogging about outlier results itâs shown in past years. Hereâs the conclusion Business Insider reached:
 Bottom line: Gallup swings wildly and it frequently has results not in line with other pollsters.</description>

The smartest man in the world canât make a gaffe, surely. When Barack Obama says something ridiculous, mean-spirited, wrongheaded, or just plain dumb, he means it.
So we know Obama considers the murders of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others mere âbumps in the roadâ to his re-election. Four bumps, to be precise.
When Obama says Israel is just âone of our strongest alliesâ in the Middle East, no longer our strongest, he means it.</description>

      <description>A couple years ago, a lot of folks believed that victory in 2010 would be a cakewalk. Led by Tea Party activists, the GOP picked up over 800 legislative seats, state and federal, in the 2010 off-year election. Rumors of the Republican Party&amp;rsquo;s death had been greatly exaggerated.

Or so it seemed.

Today, the same Obama told Mitt Romney that there not many people who consider themselves victims.

      <description>The Romney Campaign today reminded me of the McCain Campaign of 2008.
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty good at ignoring bogus, fraudulent polls like the one CNN released tonight. In that poll, CNN announced a massive 52-46 national lead for Obama. If true, the race would be all but over.
CNN, of course, cooked the books on this one.
About one-third of voters describe themselves as independents, CNN sampled only 3% independents for its latest poll.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re past Empty Chair Day. The conventions are over. Barack Obama still stands between us and liberty. And the Establishment&amp;rsquo;s more worried about its $$$ future than about America&amp;rsquo;s future.
What does that mean? It meansÂ _you and IÂ _Â will determine what happens in Election 2012 and beyond.
If you want to have a hand in America&amp;rsquo;s future, listen up.</description>

      <description>As if reading from a script written by the Romney campaign, the Democrats on Wednesday managed to mangle their public image even further, this time by booing God and Israel.

On Tuesday, the Democratic National Convention stripped God&amp;rsquo;s name from their platform and rejected Israel&amp;rsquo;s choice of Jerusalem as its capital.
Wednesday, the party panicked and rushed in an amendment to restore God and Jerusalem.</description>

      <description>When I read about Todd Akin&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate comments to Charles Jaco, my first thought was uncharitable.Â &amp;ldquo;I could just kill him.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I could kill him,&amp;rdquo; is an idiom. Its cousins include &amp;ldquo;wring his neck&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;poke his eyes out.&amp;rdquo; Idioms hyperbolize our emotional reaction to an event.
I was angry because Todd Akin gave the left a great talking point in the infamous interview. I like Todd Akin. I voted for him.</description>

      <title>7 Warning Signs That Obamaâs Imploding</title>

      <description>Hurricane Isaac smiled on the Republicans in Tampa and delivered more misery to New Orleans and its surroundings.Â That was just one of the ominous signs that 2012 is shaping up to be a forgettable year for Democrats, especially for Barack Obama.

Hereâs seven more warning signs that Obamaâs 6-year campaign is about to implode:

      <description>The story Isaac is about tests of faith.
God commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, his only son, born after Abraham and Sarah had given up hope of conceiving.
Once Isaac was bound and placed on the altar, God stayed Abraham&amp;rsquo;s hand. &amp;ldquo;Now I know you fear God.&amp;rdquo;
You know the rest.
It just struck me this morning, listening to the weather during Jamie Allman&amp;rsquo;s show, that Isaac now threatens the GOP convention, dangling above Tampa like Abraham&amp;rsquo;s dagger.</description>

What is Todd&amp;rsquo;s real crime?
He&amp;rsquo;s a damaged candidate, sure, but he is not a damaged man.
He was wrong, but** he erred on the side of life**.
It says something about a society and political mood where a man can be disqualified for loving life and God, but another man celebrated for enabling the slaughter of living children with surgical scissors through the base of their skulls.</description>

I think it&amp;rsquo;s smart to have a plan in case Todd Akin drops. The GOP central committee is working on a plan. If you wait until after a vacancy occurs, your preferences will be meaningless.
That said, if you should decide to plot a contingency to influence the selection of a candidate to fill a vacancy that might occur, consider this:Â **the MOGOP central committee is not tea-party-ish.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I blogged about loyalty to people and loyalty to principles. Both are important. Loyalty to people is an honorable principle.
Sometimes, the ideal is paramount. In 2012, we simply must take the US Senate. We must put Claire McCaskill out of office. And we must send a strong conservative to the US House of Representatives from Missouriâs 2nd Congressional district.
Missouriâs 2nd Congressional District has been well served by Todd Akin.</description>

      <description>If Mitt Romney applied game theory in choosing Paul Ryan, I have renewed respect for him. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why, but first a bit of background on game theory.
Game theory is a branch of social science concerned with strategic decision-making. It is most closely associated with economics. Professor John Nash, the subject of the movie A Beautiful Mind, won a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in game theory. (For a great primer on the subject, read Thinking Strategically: the competitive advantage in business, politics, and everyday life.</description>

      <description>Choosing Paul Ryan as his running mate was a great Romney move. Looking ahead, Romney sees movement conservatives working hard right up to the electionâeven if he or his advisors continues to say stupid things.Â That was necessary.
SCROLL DOWN FOR TWO IMPORTANT EVENTS THIS WEEK
But it wasnât enough to win the election and unseat Americaâs first anti-American president.Â To do that, we must find a way to win over the selfish middle.</description>

      <description>Why did murder skyrocket in Chicago as soon as Rahm Emanuel became mayor? Why have Americans become nastier and meaner since Barack Obama became president?

As Michael Dukakis told us, a fish rots from the head down. Obama surrounds himself with people who thrive on decay and death.
After four years, Obama has nothing to say for himself. Nothing. He can only cut and attack and lie and sneer and mock like a high school bully.</description>

      <description>I was surprised to learn that Sarah Steelman conceded the GOP Senate race at 10:00. I&amp;rsquo;d talked to Todd Akin at my polling place on Tuesday morning, and he confirmed my suspicion the [Missouri](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.5,-92.5&amp;amp;spn=3.0,3.0&amp;amp;q=38.5,-92.5 (Missouri)&amp;amp;t=h) Republican race for US Senate would be close. It really wasn&amp;rsquo;t.
Mr. Akin won handily, considering the 3-way race. John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s remarkably negative, nasty, angry campaign should have made the race much closer. It didn&amp;rsquo;t. Sarah Palin&amp;lsquo;s endorsement of Ms.</description>

      <description>Tax credits reward particular businesses or developers with tax dollars from the general population. They concentrate wealth in a few hands. Tax credits are the way politicians play the market with someone else&amp;rsquo;s money.

Worse, **Republicans are addicted to tax credits.Â **
A Missouri House Republican leader told a constituent that his party gives tax dollars to people who &amp;ldquo;spend it smarter.&amp;rdquo; Bill Clinton said the same thing in about 1992.</description>

      <description>Missouri&amp;rsquo;s primary is August 7. Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Republicans now litter the airwaves and in-boxes with smears against their Republican opponents. What strikes me is the weakness of so many of their pitches.
Every political ad is a pitch. It&amp;rsquo;s a chance to sell an idea and to volunteer as that idea&amp;rsquo;s champion in some high office. What a noble calling.
Few politicians take that noble path, sadly. Instead, they bully and vilify their opponents&amp;ndash;especially their primary opponents.</description>

Some of them already can be.
 It&amp;rsquo;s hard to get an automobile in the United States. They are owned mainly by elite bureaucrats. It takes an average of 10 years to get a car. 1 out of 7 families owned automobiles. You have to go through a major process and put the money out in advance.</description>

If, however, you believe in self-governance, that people are endowed by God and nature with the capacity and unalienable right to manage their own affairs, then a second Obama term will be a massive human rights violation.
Consider what the Obama administration has already brought us:</description>

      <description>At the Pachyderm Clubâs national convention last year, I overheard a Republican Missouri State Representative talking about HB 609. âIt was the best bill Iâve ever been involved with,â she said. âThose people who just went nuts donât know anything about insurance.â

If you read my blog, youâre likely one of the âthose people,â the ignorant masses who donât understand the fineries of the legislative process. You donât appreciate how hard the insurance industry lobbyists worked with Jefferson City to craft a law that sold only a bit of you into slavery while ensuring the insurance companies remained profitable and your favorite Republican legislators had the money to campaign next year.</description>

 Young people can also count themselves winners in the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act, which allows children to stay on their parents&amp;rsquo; insurance plan until their 26th birthday.

Like now.

For years, Congress has used the tax code to motivate behavior.Â Tax credits for insulated windows and electric cars are examples.Â The home mortgage deduction is another. And tuition tax credits, dependent tax credits, etc.</description>

In his new best-selling book, Jonah Lehrer discusses the link between depression and creativity:
 This helps explain why Forgas has found that states of sadnessâ he induces the downcast mood with a film about death and cancerâ also correlate with better writing samples; subjects compose sentences that are clearer and more compelling.</description>

      <description>In the Ronald Reagan movie Kings Row, Reagan plays Drake McHugh, whose legs are sawn off by a sadistic, class-conscious doctor.

Everyone remembers the line âWhereâs the rest of me?â No remembers what happens after that. Iâll fill you in.
McHughâs best friend, a psychiatrist, decides to tell McHugh (Reagan) the truth: his legs were perfectly healthy, but the doctor cut them off to keep the lower class McHugh from pursuing the doctorâs debutante daughter.</description>

      <description>Pack clothes, flags, and signs for an Obamacare Tea Party at Forest Park on Art Hill this week.Â The rally will begin at 7:00 PM on the day the Supreme Court rules.

We donât know the day, but we do know the time: 7:00 pm in Forest Park on Art Hill (map below). The most likely days are Monday or Thursday, but because of the magnitude of this case, it could be any day of the week.</description>

      <description>I had to go to the doctor today. The reason&amp;rsquo;s not important. Here&amp;rsquo;s what is:
**It took my doctor 10 minutes to describe my symptoms into a government-mandated voice recognition system. **
In the old days, the doctor took notes. Now, he has to recite his observations into a Mad Men-era dictaphone. &amp;ldquo;Male, age 48, blood pressure one-twenty-one over seventy-three . . . &amp;quot;
The damn machine (government medical technology) couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand half the doctor&amp;rsquo;s words.</description>

      <description>As Obama and hisÂ myrmidons continue to make asses of themselves by arguing that no one should ever put their own capital at risk, it seems timely to point out that Solyndra, and the White House&amp;rsquo;s many gambles on hypothetical energy companies, is not a fair comparison to Mitt Romney&amp;rsquo;s work at Bain &amp;amp; Co.
  Â It&amp;rsquo;s legal for individuals and companies to use their own money to buy failing companies and try to save them.</description>

      <description>Looks like about $1.2 billion of JP Morganâs $2 billion loss involved Henry Blodgetâs 401k. 
How else to explain his emotional outburst on Business Insider? Why else would he jump to the conclusion that our bankrupt federal government understands finances better than billionaires?
Hereâs Blodget:
 Wall Street can&amp;rsquo;t be trusted to manageâor even correctly assessâits own risks.
This is in part because, time and again, Wall Street has demonstrated that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even KNOW what risks it is taking.</description>

      <description>Analogies say more about the speaker than about the subject.
Candy Crowley told KMOX Radio listeners on Friday that Tea Party groups resemble the Balkans without guns.
Wrong. Crappy analogy, Candy. The diverse and autonomous, often quarrelsome,** Tea Party groups remind me of the original 13 colonies.**
The colonies were divided on just about every subject imaginable. The disagreed on slavery, on economics, on agraculture, manufacturing, cities, names &amp;ndash; name it.</description>

      <description>The new fad among Democrats is to see how many illegal aliens they can pack into a voting booth. While we conservatives decry this illegal and anti-American grab at tyrannical power, we should take some solace in this sobering fact: those illegal aliens probably know as much about the American political system as most 13th generation Americans.

The fact is, most Americans are too stupid about politics to vote, which explains the 2008 election.</description>

For the record, I have formally endorsed Senator McCaskill in her race to return to private life.
Zimmerman Update Having declared George Zimmerman guilty of first degree, racially motivated murder, the MSM are now investigating the case.

      <description>John McCain knew that Obama&amp;rsquo;s minions orchestrated massive voter fraud in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Besides using New Black Panther Party soldiers to repel McCain voters from the polls,** Democrats stuff ballot boxes to give Obama the win in two states with a combined 41 electoral votes**.

Here&amp;rsquo;s how a memo leaked by wikileaks summarized McCain&amp;rsquo;s election night decision:
 After discussions with his inner circle, which explains the delay in his speech, McCain decided not to pursue the voter fraud in PA and Ohio, despite his staff&amp;rsquo;s desire to make it an issue.</description>

The GSA scandal lit up the 3 Stooges mentality of the &amp;ldquo;men and women&amp;rdquo; who would run every aspect of your life if Obama and his czars get their way.

      <description>The look on George âStephieâ Stephanopoulosâs face was priceless. He had to say it.

âABC News now projects that President Obama will go down to defeat.â
He couldnât bring himself to say, âRomney wonâ or âRepublicans won.âÂ He just couldnât.
The network analysis was a political clichÃ© run amok. My favorite came from James Carville who told CNN viewers that the election result âproves that crackers and racists vote.â</description>

      <description>When Obama decreed that Catholics shall support and provide chemical abortions,he wasn&amp;rsquo;t promoting women. He was shackling religion.
Totalitarian autocrats don&amp;rsquo;t cotton freedom, unless they personally granted it. Obama doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in individual liberty, but that all power and rightsÂ emanateÂ from government. Timothy Cardinal Dolan agrees.
So it&amp;rsquo;s exciting to report that some St. Louisans are fighting back. Here&amp;rsquo;s the details:

      <description>Is the Tea Party dead? That&amp;rsquo;s the big question this week around the Lake of the Ozarks.

First, Eric ReeveÂ The Lake Liberal wrote this letter-to in Lake News Online. He concludes:
 We may hear of the Tea Party here and there in the future, but I doubt it will ever figure prominently in American politics again.Â I say we should take a moment and reflect on what it might have been as we say farewell to the once promising Tea Party movement.</description>

      <description>The After Party is Thursday, April 19, at 7 pm. The location is Crowne Plaza Hotel in Clayton.
The subject is the corrupt and corrupting judge selection process in Missouri, and how you can help change it. I learned a lot about the subject when Ed Martin pointed out this National Review article on the subject.
 The structure and left-wing dominance of the nominating commission (the distinctive feature of the Missouri Plan) has led many to argue that the state should amend the constitution to either directly elect judges or have them selected under something mirroring the advice/consent model set forth in the U.</description>

      <description>November 7, 2012âWhen the AP called Florida for Obama only twenty minutes after polls closed there (8:00 EDT), any hopes of a Republican presidential victory were dashed.

And before polls closed in the West, we knew that the GOP had lost the House as well as seven state legislatures.
In short, the Grand Old Party died last night.
Hereâs what went wrong.

 Justice Ginsburg swung by Cairo last month to help out the lads from the Muslim Brotherhood building the new Egypt: âI would not look to the United States Constitution if I were drafting a constitution in the year 2012,â she advised them.
 That a sitting Supreme Court justice would denigrate the Constitution she&amp;rsquo;s sworn to uphold in a foreign country deserves the sort of scorn normally reserved for traitors.</description>

      <description>We wonât know the result until late June, most likely. And the results of todayâs vote could change by then.

Still, itâs sort of weird that after three years of public, wildly emotional and stupifyingly complex arguments, the fate of the republic comes down to a short meeting in Washington involving nine people in a paneled room.
Mark Sherman of AP describes the cloistered scene:
 After months of anticipation, thousands of pages of briefs and more than six hours of arguments, the justices will vote on the fate of President Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s health care overhaul in under an hour Friday morning.</description>

      <description>The term âUnited Statesâ is both plural (many states united) and singular (the United States). The tag line âe pluribus unumâ loses its meaning if we cease to be many, if we give up our identities as individual states. As states, we are as different from each other as the United States is from Canada.
The United States are most powerful pursuing opportunities and fixing problems in the plural but defending in the singular.</description>

John Knowlesâs classic novel, A Separate Peace, begins memorably:
 I went back to the Devon School not long ago, and found it looking oddly newer than when I was a student there fifteen years before . . . as if a coat of varnish had been put over everything for better preservation.

      <description>When the Supreme Court rules on ObamaCare, it will define Barack Obama as either a winner or loser.

James Carville says overturning ObamaCare would be the best thing that could happen to Democrats. I think heâs wrong.
ObamaCare is the centerpiece of Obamaâs term in office. He put all of Americaâs business on hold for a year to pass it. He coerced, lied, intimidated, and threatened to get the law passed.</description>

Michael Patrick Leahy, among a very small group of patriots who hatched the first round of Tea Parties in February 2009, documents the US Governmentâs 230 year history of Constitutional infidelity.
My full review will be finished soon, but donât wait: buy Covenant of Liberty today.

Did you know that ObamaCare is my fault?
Of course, it is. Read my story below the clock.

**I didnât vote in 2006. You know why? **
I put it off.
I decided not to stop on my way to work in the morning. Why? _Iâll have plenty of time tonight, _I thought. Iâll stop on my way home.</description>

      <description>Rodger Cook fools no one into thinking heâs a member of the political class. Heâs not. Rodgerâs a human being, like the rest of us. Thatâs just one of the reasons that Rodger Cook has earned my personal endorsement in next Tuesdayâs (March 20) Illinois primary.*

Actually, Rodgerâs not so much like the rest of us. Rodger has served the people of Illinois all of his adult life. Rodger has been a police officer, a detective, a mayor, and private businessman.</description>

      <description>When youâre the Republican Establishmentâs candidate, you have one simple assignment: donât screw up.
Jason Plummer, a 29-year-old lumber heir, is the GOP Establishmentâs appointed candidate for US Congress in Illinoisâ 12th Congressional District. Heâs facing a shockingly tough race from former police detective and former Belleville Mayor, Rodger Cook. (Never underestimate a detectiveâs tenacity.)
In a debate last week, Plummer failed his one simple assignment. Despite a nearly unlimited war chest from his familyâs fortune and the Illinois GOP treasury, Plummer said something stupid.</description>

      <description>When I was on the USS John C. Calhoun, the XO and I were big Rush fans. We stockpiled Snapple in the outboards of the Shipâs Office just to have a little taste of EIB during our three-month patrols.
That was 1992. Back when this countryâs government still held onto some strand of connection to its founding.

      <description>Jennifer Pahlka is a remarkable woman. She realized what many have realized: government often fails at its most basic tasks.
Governments don&amp;rsquo;t keep up with technology or culture. Nor can they act nimbly. A start-up produces finished products worth millions in four months; it takes government that long to start the first feasibility study.
Spotting government&amp;rsquo;s shortcomings isn&amp;rsquo;t what makes Jennifer so amazing. Every sane American knows that government is a nightmare of bureaucratic hell that admires problems and punishes the successful.</description>

      <description>The first entry in National Reviewâs âThe Weekâ from sometime around 1990 listed ten or so former Soviet bloc countries that recently had shed the yoke of communist repression. And it made a simple statement:
 âIt must be nice to live in a country where you get freer every day.â

      <description>The 3rd Anniversary Tea Party rocked . . . because of the great patriot-activists who have decided itâs time to act and win.

Although Dr. Larry Schweikart couldnât make it (because of the Chicago snow storm), Fridayâs event was better than planned or expected.Â Tea Party champion Michael Patrick Leahy jumped into fill a last-minute void, and the crowd loved it.
I had the the pleasure of reading and advanced copy of Mike Leahy&amp;rsquo;s new book, Covenant of Liberty: The Ideological Origins of the Tea Party Movementin December.</description>

      <description>I see is all the time. Supporters of Establishment candidates complain that their opponents are establishment, too.
We saw it in the Missouri 2nd District.Â We see in the GOP Presidential primary.Â The last refuge of the Establishmentâs candidates is to spread the pain of the Establishment label.
What many people donât get is what the Establishment label actually means.Â Itâs time everyone understood this.

Today is Washingtonâs Birthday. As a posthumous birthday gift to our first president and commander-in-chief of the army that won our war for independence, I offer a simple wish: that the army of liberty formed in February 2009, known as âthe Tea Party,â will resist the temptation to resign.

The fact is that Obamaâs surging at just the right time. His re-election chances are now above 50 percent. His intrade.com chances of winning are near 60 percent. And heâs raising more money than al of the Republican candidates combined.</description>

Barack Obama and his myrmidon Kathleen Sebelius tried to erase the First Amendment. They tried to erase religious freedom. They tried to take away yet another foundational liberty that made America America.

**Santorum is most appealing to conservativesâfrom Evangelicals to Tea Partiers: **
 Santorum is now completely dominating with several key segments of the electorate, especially the most right leaning parts of the party. With those describing themselves as &amp;lsquo;very conservative,&amp;rsquo; he&amp;rsquo;s now winning a majority of voters at 53% to 20% for Gingrich and 15% for Romney. Santorum gets a majority with Tea Party voters as well at 51% to 24% for Gingrich and 12% for Romney.</description>

Relate to this: if Mitt Romneyâs a conservative, Iâm a Hottentot.

By ârelate to,â the media and Romneyâs handlers actually mean âhoodwink.â While Romney might secure the GOP nomination without conservative support, his campaign will go down in flames without conservative grassroots boots on the ground from Labor Day to Election Day.</description>

I get some comments and see a lot of tweets about the inevitability that any Republican will win in November.
Thatâs frightening.
The prospect of a Republican beating Obama isn&amp;rsquo;t frightening, of courseâany of the four remaining candidates would be night and day better for our future.Â Whatâs frightening is that so many people bet on the unknowable.
Except in rare casesâone candidate is caught stealing from a church weeks before the electionâpolitical elections carry too many variables for anyone to predict their results a month in advance, much less three-quarters of a year ahead.</description>

      <description>At some point, each additional GOP Presidential debate becomes just a bigger pain in the . . . But science shows us that the last debate before a voteâand the last memorable event in the last debateâis paramount to how we remember the entire event.
In fact, memorable moments at the end, not consistent performance throughout, determine who wins and who loses.

      <description>Two weeks ago, weeks ago, how many Missouri statewide offices did you expect to flip? Be honest.
Yes, there are great people running for Governor, Secretary of State, and Treasurer.Â And we already have a fine Lieutenant Governor Kinder running for re-election.
But numerous factors, like name recognition, experience, and Jay Nixonâs weird relationship with Republican House leadership, made a major upset unlikely. And no Republicans had stepped up to challenge Chris Koster for Attorney General.</description>

And Ron Paul did way better than I expected. Congratulations to Dr. Paul and Mitt. 
I still think my Saturday night post accurately reflected the national impressions, though. Thatâs backed up by this CBS News poll that shows Republicans believe Santorum most closely shares their values, butâand this is a J Lo butâthey believe Romney is more electable.</description>

      <description>Sundays are useful touchstones for our goals.
Last week, I told you about my maniacal focus for 2012. At the beginning of the week, I stuck carefully to my plan. But after two consecutive 15-hour days at work, I let my mind wander a little. Iâm sure you know how that goes.
Well, Sunday is a great touchstone. And who provided my guidance and support? A 16th century saint and Doctor of the Church.</description>

      <title>Who Won the New Hampshire Republican Debate?</title>

      <description>It depends on how you score. 
I see three scoring scenarios: 1. Best conservative performance 2. Best electability performance 3. Best positional performance
Conservative performance is pretty clear: whose answers appeal to conservatives? (Does not mean conservatives believed the candidate meant what he said.) This is not Tea Party scoring, either. Iâm not limiting my evaluation to the 3 core Tea Party principles of Constitutionally limited government, free markets, and fiscal responsibility.</description>

      <title>BREAKING: Santorum Pulls Away with 13-Vote Lead</title>

      <description>Thatâs with 88 percent of the counting complete.
The bigger story: Romneyâs underperforming his 2008 results in key counties. Santorum outperforming Huckabee in 2008.

What does it all mean?
Conservatives and libertarians dominate the caucuses.
Romney is the choice of the Republican establishment. The cronies poured millions into his campaign even before he declared himself a conservative. Heâs won endorsements from just about every big name general election loser include Bob Dole and George H.</description>

      <description>Until the clock struck twelve on January 1, that is.
Thatâs when 40,000 â count âem, forty thousandânew laws took effect in the United States.
Some of the new laws are, no doubt, good and proper. Some restore liberties lost. But others bind. And some are silly.
Utahâs banning happy hours. (Why not ban melancholy hours instead?) California now prohibits people 18 and under from using tanning beds. Georgia requires golf carts to have turn signals and horns if driven on public roads.</description>

      <description>Some St. Louis area conservatives cheered Roy Bluntâs (R-MO) elevation to the Number 5 leadership position in the Senate Republican caucus.

I didnât. At least not politically. I like Senator Blunt personally, so Iâm happy in that respect. But Iâm not happy for the reasons some others are.
First, as I told Jo Mannies of the St. Louis Beacon, internal party stuff isnât really a Tea Party matter. Leadership in the Senateâs GOP caucus is for Republican Senators to worry about.</description>

      <description>Everyone knows and accepts that government does stupid things. Sometimes it feels like people institute governments and delegate them certain powers just to give us something to complain about.
Government stupidity, scandal, and corruption hits different people in different ways. Government hyperactivity keeps poor people poor by limiting opportunity and by building barriers to exiting poverty programs. âIf you take that job, youâll lose your health insurance.â Compassion my non-qualifying asset.</description>

      <description>I live in a very hilly area. Yet Iâm still alive. Explain that.
Maybe thatâs why Iâm a lower-case ârâ republican and not an upper-case one.
Republicans seem to feel every hill is worth dying on.
What else could explain the Houseâs rejection of a silly payroll tax cut extension followed by a doubly-damaging capitulation?
By âsilly,â I mean ill-advised, inconsequential, irrational, and fiscally irresponsible. The Senateâs two-month extension of the Social Security tax cut represents the worst of Washington.</description>

      <description>Have you ever studied human networks?
Iâm not talking about online social networks alone, but any kind of human network.
Theyâre amazing.

Networks tend to determine who we date, who we marry, and where we work. Our lives are more influenced by networks than we can imagine.
 A network community can be defined as a group of people who are much more connected to one another than they are to other groups of connected people found in other parts of the network.</description>

      <description>The middle of the road is fine until you have to get somewhere.
I voted for Bob Dole in 1996. Yet his nomination drove me away from political activism for years.

I got out of the Navy in the fall of 1994. I watched the GOP reclaim the House with my nephew, Scott.Â I expected the Republicans to nominate a solid conservative who deliver a knock-out blow to the Clinton era two years later.</description>

      <description>A college student asked me a question: Why join the Tea Party?

He was wondering why anyone would want to associate with people who behaved reprehensibly at two earlier Republican debates.
Hereâs how I replied:
 Johnny,
 Sorry that I&amp;rsquo;m just getting to this. I get a lot of email, and sometimes I miss things.
I organized the tea party in St. Louis in 2009. I did so because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that governments accumulate power until they crush liberty and freedom.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine told me this story.
 He sat that there bragging about getting a tax cut for friends of his.
I said, âyou do realize, donât you, that youâre just like the Democrats, except youâre giving taxpayers money to a different special interest.â
He looked at me and said, âbut our special interests do good with the money.â
 My friend was talking about the second highest-ranking Republican in the Missouri House at the time.</description>

      <description>Tuesday in Kansas, President Barack Obama revealed his contempt for liberty. He declared that human beings are incapable of running their own lives . . . but, somehow, other, superior human beings are capable of running their own and othersâ.
He said that free markets have always failed, everywhere . . . ignoring most of the last 240 years.
He all but declared himself a Marxist.
I am depressed that America let this dangerous man into our government.</description>

      <description>Yes, the establishment wants you to go away.
Are you going to obey?

With a little help from The Atlantic and New York Times (of all places), we can put together a strategy to recognize and deflect the establishmentâs tactics.
Put this in your back pocket. Youâll need it before primary season is over.
Establishment Tactic 1: Never admit membership in the establishment
How To Handle: Never argue about what he establishment is.</description>

      <description>Sometimes the right path is the easy path.
Then the alarm goes off, and we get up to face the world.
When we first met in February 2009, we set ourselves on a course. We dedicated ourselves to, in Buckleyâs words, stand athwart history, yelling âSTOP!â
But we promised ourselves and the world even more. We committed to reversing the neglect and abuse thatâs stained our liberty for more than half a century.</description>

      <description>A few years ago, Malcolm Gladwell wrote an awesome article for The New Yorker:Â How David Beats Goliath.Â Read it after you read this.
The story encourages and frustrates at the same time.
Encourages because we learn Davids can, occasionally, beat Goliaths.Â Frustrates because Goliaths tend to change the rules just before the epic battle.

Thatâs how the establishment winsâby establishing the rules. And changing them as necessary. Not exactly fair,Â but fairness isnât in the rule book.</description>

      <description>The Gipper didnât always follow his own commandment.
Iâve appreciated Newt Gingrichâs attitude during the 398 Republican Presidential debates. You know, his approach of refusing to attack his opponents.
He will, necessarily, change that approach a bit on the stump, but itâs been very effective so far. As Gingrich might put it, anyone on this stage will do a better job than Barack Obama.
And heâd be right.
But being right about that doesnât mean candidates donât have an obligation to show voters why theyâre preferable to their opponents.</description>

      <description>I hear about it all the time. People are frustrated with me. With St. Louis Tea Party.
They&amp;rsquo;re frustrated because they hear about our events afterÂ the events.
That&amp;rsquo;s no good. We want people at the events. That&amp;rsquo;s what makes them events.
**What you asked for was some way to get a phone call about upcoming events. **
That&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable. The question is, how are we going to pay for it?</description>

      <description>The quality of the answers you get in life depend on the quality of the questions you ask.

Sometimes, though, when offered the chance to ask important questions, we ask questions about personal gain or immediate problems. That&amp;rsquo;s natural. Our brains are wired to prompt us with the urgent, immediate things in our lives.
But sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s not the best strategy. Sometimes we need answers to the bigger questions&amp;ndash;questions that may be crucial later.</description>

      <description>Like the Penn State athletic department, most St. Louis news media covered up a sex crime in order to protect an organization they love.
The St. Louis Post Dispatch, KTVI 2 and KPLR 11, and KSDK 5 each failed to report a sexual assault that took place at the illegal OccupySTL squatters&amp;rsquo; village in Kiener Plaza last week.
The assault came to light only because a citizen-journalist, the POed Patriot, monitors the police crime map.</description>

Now, weather in Thailand&amp;ndash;and the tsunami in Japan&amp;ndash;threaten to upend American politics in the 2012. Your economic future could hang in the balance.

      <description>America has but one political party capable of winning races on a scale large enough to change government practices: the Republican Party.
When the GOP takes Washington (or Jefferson City), things don&amp;rsquo;t seem to get better. Wonder why?
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a little stroll down memory lane.
 &amp;ldquo;To secure the nomination, the Dewey forces spent money and made deals and promises that Taft would never make. Offers were made of Federal jobs that Delegates could not resist.</description>

      <description>The Tea Party movement faces its greatest danger right now.Â The future of this country, therefore, straddles a sharp and angry line.Â One wrong move and everything that weâve built over the past two and half years will collapse around us.

Occupy Wall Street is a communist idea built on the very same factors that inspired the Tea Party movement. If Tea Partiers let their disdain for the messenger distort our message, the American experiment will end.</description>

With Christie out of the race, the money will flood toward the establishment guy, Romney. In other words, the race will be over before Thanksgiving. Romney will be the GOP candidate.Â Whether he beats Obama is a coin flip.
Romney will in the nomination, unless conservatives put country before pride.</description>

      <description>I try not to ask for much.Â Okay, maybe thatâs not true, but Iâm going to ask you a favor, anyway. Mark this down:Â **7:00 pm, Saturday, October 1.Â **
Itâs weird, I know.Â But Iâm asking for three presents in one.
First, my mom and dad celebrate their wedding anniversary this week. (62nd?)Â Second, my wife and I celebrate our wedding anniversary this week.Â Third, next week is my birthday.</description>

      <description>Herman Cain is riding a wave of popularity because of his upset win in the Florida straw poll on Saturday.Â Heâs helped by Rick Perryâs free-fall and Mitt Romneyâs establishmentarianism.Â But Cain is a huge underdog.
Thatâs okay because **America loves an underdog. **
Hereâs what must happen right now for Herman Cain to win:
1.Â Social Media avalanche.Â Get @THEHermanCain trending on Twitter, and keep it there for five consecutive days.</description>

      <description>In 2001, I loaded my three boys, ages 13, 10, and 8 at the time, into the car and headed to downtown St. Louis. The Cubs were in town, and I planned to introduce my boys to the greatest rivalry in pro sports. We parked (for twenty dollars) and headed toward the stadium.
There was only one problem: we didnât have any tickets. I planned to buy some on the street.</description>

Before we go into that, hear me out on the pressure on those candidates.

Imagine being on a stage. Searing white brightness reduces your range of vision to a few degrees of arc. You hear hundreds of people making the sounds that audiences make, but you canât really see them.

Well, not all.Â some if itâs my fault, but in a very innocent way.
Planning The After Party
Eisenhower said that planning is essential, but plans are useless.Â He was right.
When we were planning The After Party, we figured about 50, maybe 75,Â people would attend at each one.</description>

      <description>When Jay Nixon decided to ignore the voters, ignore the Missouri Constitution, and ignore the power of the legislature, he spit in our faces. But why?
Maybe because his special session is failing.
Maybe because, to save the centerpiece of that legislation, House Speaker Steve Tilley needed protection from the grass roots.
Maybe because Jay Nixon is as crooked as a dogâs hind leg and doesnât give a hoot about you, your state, your country, or the law.</description>

I have. They remind me of several things. My Uncle Patrick Mahon, for one. Uncle Pat and I watched M_A_S*H reruns every day at 4:00 when I was a kid.Â We met at my Aunt Mameâs house (unwed sister to Pat and my mom).Â Uncle Pat drank coffeeâusually black with sugarâand smoked unfiltered cigarettes.
Uncle Pat retired from the St. Louis Fire Department in about 1976 (rough guess).</description>

      <description>Dig this opening paragraph â&amp;gt;
 As the marathon for the presidency, 1980, begins to quicken, the American electorate is in a singularly sour and pessimistic mood. Not only is the public naturally worried about the economy, energy and inflation, but it doubts things will improve much. The country is anxious to find strong leaders âthe evidence is overwhelmingâand the public has little faith that Jimmy Carter has the ability, let alone the programs, to solve the nation&amp;rsquo;s problems.</description>

And you know, there is only one way to beat and win that war. The one thing about Tea Party people is we like a good fight. And you know what? They&amp;rsquo;ve got a war, they got a war with us and there&amp;rsquo;s only going to be one winner.</description>

      <description>Aerotropolis is a pretty obvious attempt to shift tax money into the pockets of Jefferson City favorites. It&amp;rsquo;s an example of crony capitalism at its worst.
Now,KMOV Channel 4&amp;rsquo;s Craig Cheatham shines the light on the people buying and selling St. Louis in this series. Not just Aerotropolis, but the whole oligarchy of incompetent, corrupt, and self-serving Boss Hog-types who seem bent on reducing the St. Louis region to irrelevance.</description>

If, however, you like the screaming in wilderness, stop reading now. This post is for those who want to continue the mission set forth in February 2009.</description>

One point that I should have made before being prompted by Edâs speech. Trading Missouri sovereignty for a few pieces of ObamaCare silver is simple cowardice. Governor Nixon, and any Republican who voted for the healthcare exchange, should be retiredâon their own or in a primary.</description>

Read Martinâs challenge:
 Today, I am inviting both of these distinguished ladies to St Louis, Missouri to tell me and my Tea Party compatriots in person why we should go straight to Hell. Congresswoman Waters should know the way here, having been born and raised in our esteemed area and a graduate of Vashon High School, which is in the St Louis Public School District.</description>

 It was just announced in Wisconsin that the unprecedented recall elections of Republicans will take place August 9.
 The leftists dreamed. Visions of a union-boss oligarchy danced in their heads. Posters misquoted Marx and Lenin. Others wanted nothing to do with waiting two months for an election: they were ready to take up arms and violently overthrow the Wisconsin government.</description>

      <description>Warren Buffett makes the erroneous claim that he pays less in taxes than does his secretary. He claims that the government thus âcoddlesâ the rich. He asks the government to increase his taxes, and the taxes of others like him, as if he is incapable of doing that on his own.
Buffett is half right. He proves that government coddles people by** asking the government to solve his problem of guilt**.</description>

Flasback to May 23 of this year. Thatâs when Barack Obama made the surprise announcement that he would begin accelerated troop withdrawals in July. That timetable meant beginning the withdrawal during the summer fighting season.
Current and former military experts advised the president against this reckless move.</description>

      <description>Answer: Bondbonds.
Sometimes the only option is humor.Â Maybe itâs time to laugh . . . at ourselves, at our pre-occupations, and at our president.
We elected him. And, in a republic, you always get the leadership you deserve.
Now what?
Now focus. Public displays of anger only hurt us. Anger is a tactic.
Yes, Iâm angry. Furious. But acting out on anger does us no good.Â Instead, wise men and women focus that anger into a steely resolve to electorally destroy the cretins that destroyed Americaâs credit rating, liberty, and economy.</description>

Dan is an original Tea Party organizer. Heâs been at it since 2009. And heâs just about worn out. According to the Wall Street Journal, Blackfordâs given up his position in theÂ Houston Tea Party.
 All the protests, the organization, the fundraising, the block-walking, has it done anything? Are we better off than we were two years ago? I say &amp;lsquo;No.â

      <description>Thereâs hysteria on both sides.Â From Satan Sandwiches to âkilling future generations,â youâd think Congress is voting on a bill to launch the US nuclear arsenal on Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.
There are reasons to distrust the deal.Â I distrust it.
There are great reasons todistrust the Congressional committee charged with finding more cuts.
The bill does far too little, too slowly,Â to prevent a credit rating cut in the near future.</description>

      <description>Yes, the Tea Party movement influenced what went on in Washington.
No, the Tea Party is not the winner. (No one won.)
No, this debt deal wonât guide the government off the road toward bankruptcy. Hereâs why.
  No Entitlement Fix: In fact, it appears that entitlements arenât touched. Entitlements are the nationâs spending problem. Not roads and bridges, not the military. Entitlements.

      <description>Our present crisis is the result of:
** Too much borrowing ** Too much spending ** Too much government control ** Too much taxing
Those who argue that America needs to borrow, spend, regulate, and tax more are simply wrong, wrong, wrong. Their argument is absurd on its face.
The way to increase revenue to government is to increase the economic activity of the people. You do that by giving the people maximum control over their destinies.</description>

      <description>Aerotropolis on Prezi
With thanks to Show-Me Institute for their wonderful research.
Points to remember:
** The China Hub is not dependent on Aerotropolis ** The author of the plan thinks it will fail ** St. Louis has 18 million square feet of empty warehouse space right now ** Aerotropolis would hurt many companies who have vacant warehouse space ** Aerotropolis would transfer $360 million tax dollars to just two entities: a private developer and the City of St.</description>

      <description>Look, folks, letâs remember whoâs on whose side.
Dana Loesch is a champion of liberty, the conservative grassroots, and everything else we stand for. And sheâs a great friend to me, to the Tea Party, and, in a sense, to all of us. Sheâs elevated this movement locally and nationally like no one else. You wouldnât be reading this post if not for her.
I am so sorry that my piece from last night raised tempers.</description>

      <description>Iâll be honest with you: Iâve lied.
Usually out of desperation. Iâve lied to those closest to meâthose most willing to forgive the thing I lied about.
Iâve also told the truth to my own detriment. In the long run, the latter works best. In fact, telling the truth works best in the short run, too.
So maybe Obamaâs desperate. Maybe he knows that the debt ceiling debate is the beginning of the unraveling of Americum Sovieticum, his life-long dream.</description>

      <description>Roy Blunt has not given an inch in thebattle over the debt ceiling. He deserves high praise for his resolve.
During the 2010 Republican primary, many on the right questioned Blunt&amp;rsquo;s fiscal conservative credentials. As a member of the House, Blunt had helped craft some and pass unpopular spending bills, including TARP. On theissue of debt and responsibility, though, he shows no sign of cracking.
Government debt is the defining issue of our time, perhaps of the American experiment.</description>

      <description>July 4, 2011, felt hollow, like celebrating the birthday of someone deceased.
Independence Day celebrates the birth of an idea: that people create governments and empower them, not the other way around.
Do we still believe that?

Yes, I still believe that. Morally, at least. And you probably do, too.
Does America still believe that government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed? Or do we, as a nation, believe that government has a monopoly on liberty and dispenses it at its will?</description>

      <description>A Harvard study recently concluded that attending American Independence Day celebrations could turn kids into Republicans.

The reason 4th of July creates Republicans has nothing to do with patriotism and everything to do with education. Hereâs why:
* On July 4th, we celebrate the Declaration of Independence, not the founding of the United States. (That would come with the passage of the Constitution thirteen years later).** July 4th events teach kidsâin an environment free from teacher-union propagandaâthe _reasons_ we broke from England.</description>

      <description>I was 18 and a college freshman. It was a Tuesday night in October. My 1970 Chevy Impala felt wide open in the fifty-degree air and the smell of freshly fallen leaves.
I drove through Forest Park feeling the rhythm of the yellow street lights as I moved between light and dark. &amp;ldquo;Memory&amp;rdquo; from Cats came on the radio. I lit a Camel (no filter).
I was free.

In America, we often think of independence as a collective thing.</description>

      <description>Iâll save you some time: itâs Ed Martin.
Please Consider
Iâve met the former Missouri GOP head and former US Ambassador to Luxembourg a couple of times. Ann Wagner is smart, funny, and engaging. I think sheâd make an outstanding Republican candidate for the US House. If elected, sheâd serve Missouri well.
Missouri and the tea party wonât be the big winners if Ann Wagner gets the nomination, though. That distinction would go to the Missouri Republican establishmentâthe same establishment that the tea party hopes to reform or replace.</description>

      <description>The University of Missouri St. Louis uses tax dollars to provide a recruiting station for the Communist Party USAâan organization whose purpose is to shred the United States Constitution.
UMSL Student Philip Christofanelli heroically chronicles the remarkable Marxist indoctrination known as âIntroduction to Labor Studiesâ on BigGovernment.com.Â Iâll give you a taste:
 Prof. Giljum then introduced Tony Pecinovsky, a local organizer for the Communist Party, who proceeded to speak to us for two hours about the beliefs of the Communist Party and the benefits of membership.</description>

Since Ollie North&amp;rsquo;s testimony to Congress during the Iran-Contra Hearings in the Reagan Administration, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working toward this one man&amp;rsquo;s death.

But Gail Hackett refuses to answer hard questions.
I have one question for the UMKC Provost: ****
**Do you agree with Don Giljumâs statement âI believe in a violent overthrow of Bourgeois?â **
Before you answer, remember that Giljumâs use of the personal term âBourgoisâ instead of the the class âbourguoisieâ indicates that Giljim believes in violence against individual members of the middle class.</description>

First, KMOX is reporting that an UMSL professor has resigned** over the controversy**.Â For the life of me, I cannot find who the professor is. I thought that everyone involved was either an instructor or a guest lecturer.Â If you know the answer to the riddle, please use the comment form.

Jay Nixon just asked the legislature to transfer $400 million from the taxpayers to the University of Missouri System. Unless the Governor or the Legislature acts at your request, some of that money will go to put you out of work.</description>

      <description>Governor Nixon:
What does it take to get your attention? What does it take to get you to act?
Your University of Missouri System humiliates this state, and you refuse to act.
Under your nose, the UofM teaches or encourages:
* **[Politically motivated](https://biggovernment.com/publius/2011/04/25/union-official-professor-teach-college-course-in-violent-union-tactics/) violence**** **Politically motivated [industrial sabotage](https://biggovernment.com/publius/2011/04/25/how-to-college-course-on-violent-union-tactics-part-ii-case-studies-edition/)**** **Politically motivated threats of violence and sabotage**** **Supporting and aiding [the enemy in Iraq and Afghanistan](https://biggovernment.com/driehl/2011/04/26/college-course-us-flag-is-racist-how-to-defeat-america-in-iraq-and-afghanistan/)**  You have permit these travesties.

Thatâs right, UMSL and UMKC are teaching kids how to destroy business in America. They want your job to go overseas. And the guy leading the class is a proud communist.

âBig tentâ is Republican for âsurrender.â Itâs not for me.

      <description>And, heâs back.
Missouri House Speaker Steve Tilley (R-Perryville) has signed onto legislation designed to circumvent the Electoral College in presidential elections. Like his position on embryonic stem cell research and the national debt, Tilley seems far out of step with Missouriâs Republican base on this. And this guy wants to be Lt. Governor?Â Please.
This might be old news to some.

In this case, the issue is the massive U.S. debt and what that debt is about to do to America.

      <description>Patrick Tuohey made some good points about the office of Lieutenant Governor.Â Based on that, I thought up all the possible reasons someone would run for LooeyG.
1.Â Stepping Stone:Â Establish state-wide name recognition and give yourself plenty of time to run for that next office, like U.S. Senate or Governor.
2.Â Party Reptile:Â If the governor is or is likely to be of the opposite party, you get to be the de facto head of your party in the state.</description>

      <description>Letâs face it: the Missouri GOP has become a club to advance the careers of a select few favorites. It is not a party to advance conservative principles.
And that needs to change here and now.
And that means some old names need to retire.
Hereâs just one example of the ideological impotence of the Missouri Republican Party:Â The St. Louis County Assessor.
The GOP created the St. Louis County Assessorâs office because of corruption and incompetence in the political patronage version of the office under Democrats Buzz Westfall and Charlie Dooley.</description>

State Senators Jim Lembke (@jimlembke), Brian Nieves (@briannieves), Rob Schaaf (@robschaaf), and Will Kraus stood for principle. And the left immediately went berserk.
The collectivistsâthose who hate personal achievement and fiscal responsibility in governmentâwill target these men.Â We must have their backs.

      <description>POâed Patriot has the story.
Jake Zimmermanâs campaign rotates two themes:
  The St. Louis County Assessor should be a career political hack, not a seasoned real estate professional
  His little old friend, Margaret, is in danger of losing her home.
  But mostly St. Louis County government needs more Democrat political hacks.
Turns out that, just like Jakeâs dad, his friend Margaret, a rather unsuccessful real estate investor, got a break on her property taxes.</description>

Troubling Questions for Zimmermanâs Assessor Campaign:
 * Why did the Zimmerman campaign take screen shots of Zimmermanâs dadâs real estate values on January 13, 2011, the day he was selected?</description>

The rest of Jake Tapperâs story gets more disturbing.
* The President and the Defense Secretary seem to disagree on national interest** The Secretary of State cannot articulate a consistent US policy** Hillary Clinton seems to believe that the UN is a legal alternative to the US Congress  More than week into a war that lacks even the thinnest thread of Constitutionality, Barack Obama seems clueless.</description>

      <description>On Monday, we learned that US Senator Claire McCaskill failed to pay property taxes on her personal luxury jet for three years. Previously, she had charged taxpayers some of the cost of operating her private plane. Before that, it seems, she registered the plane in property tax-free Delaware.
On Monday, Claire wrote a $287,000 check without batting an eye. Now, St. Louis County says she owes them another $33,000 in interest and penalties, for a total bill of $320,000.</description>

      <description>Historians will mark March 19 as the day the Obama presidency reached its point of no return.
The image of a cowardly and selfish child-president flying to Brazil to launch a war will haunt his legacy, like Nixonâs vulgarities on tape in 1974. Obamaâs war on Libya has doomed an already weak administration.
Today, Germany pulled out of NATO because of the bungled, late, and idiotic intervention. It appears, now, that the alliance that won the Cold War and help sustain two decades of peace could collapse under a lack of American leadership.</description>

      <description>When the US invaded Iraq in 2003, it do so with the clear intent of bringing its enemyâSaddamâs regimeâto an unconditional surrender. That was the objective.Â Despite what happened after that objective was achieved, we went in with a clear and measurable purpose.
The motivating reason for our foray into Iraq was also clear.Â We believed at the time that Saddam Husseinâs possession of &amp;ndash; and desire for more &amp;ndash; weapons of mass destruction posed an imminent threat to US interests and citizens.</description>

Itâs bad enough that corruption, nepotism, and Machiavellian favoritism runs rampant in St. Louis County. Whatâs worse is that Dooley doesnât seem to care what anyone thinks.
 St. Louis County in the third year of a hiring and pay freeze, Mike Temporiti landed a $70,000 county job.

The job was never posted, and Temporiti did not have to interview for it.</description>

      <description>According to a book by historians Neil Howe and William Strauss, history follows a fairly predictable pattern, rotating in cycles equal to a long human life. The book, The Fourth Turning, was written in 1997.
Read it.
If Howe and Strauss are rightâand so far, theyâre dead onâthen we recently entered a Fourth Turning in the current saeculum which they named âmillennium.â
What is a Fourth Turning?
 The Fourth Turning is a Crisis, a decisive era of secular upheaval, when the values regime propels the replacement of the old civic order with a new one.</description>

This time, you and I have the job to elect Chip Wood for County Assessor.* Hereâs why.
In 2010, voters created an elected assessorâs office in St. Louis County. The Republicans pushed for this new office because of corruption, abuse, and waste in the County Assessorâs office under Charlie Dooley.</description>

      <description>Next Election: 4 weeks from today. I need a favor. This will only take you a minute (tops), but itâs very important that you do it right now.
I will step you through it.
  Get a pen or pencil and something to write onâpreferably a journal or appointment calendar.
  Go to April 5, 2011, or write April 5, 2011, if not using a calendar or dated journal.</description>

      <description>Iâm getting a lot of requests to pump news about Claire McCaskillâs comments to Democrats. According to Brian R. Hook of Missouri Watchdog, McCaskill gave Democrats a set of instructions very similar to those I usually give at the end of Tea Party rallies. (Only Claireâs instructions seem a bit less human than mine.)
Some national political scientists believe McCaskillâs Senate seat is one of the most vulnerable in 2012.</description>

      <description>Dana Loesch on facebook gave kudos to Missouri State Senators Nieves and Lembke for fighting a federal bribe to the states.
 Major props to Brian Nieves and Jim Lembke for their continued commitment to conservatism in the MO Senate with HB 163 - refusing federal funds for another unemployment extension that costs taxpayers $81 million. They&amp;rsquo;re standing their ground against some of their fellow GOP who need to be reminded what fiscal conservatism is.</description>

      <description>For decades, now, public sector unions have imposed onerous tax increases and service cuts on the net tax payers of many states. Wisconsin being among the worst.
What do I mean by that?
Look at whatâs going on in Wisconsin. The people who represent the net tax payersâthose who pay more in taxes to the state than they receive in salaryâare being vilified, harassed, threatened, and assaulted by the net tax takersâthose receive more in state wages than they pay in state taxes.</description>

Senator Schmittâs office tells me that he has no intention of filibustering this bill. He went on to say that he agrees in principle with the billâs intent and may actually support it, depending on the language. _
Please accept my apology and help me make it right. Please call or write Senator Schmittâs office (below) and tell him Thank You.</description>

      <description>Two years ago today, fifteen hundred Americans took time off work, school, and leisure. You braved high winds and low temps to stand under the Arch and say, âWeâve had enough.â
Since then, over 1,000 state and federal offices have changed hands.Â In nearly 100 percent of these switches moves power from the privileged to the people. Some more than others. Some not enough.Â But an amazing reversal of trends, nonetheless.</description>

      <description>I continue hearing reliable reports that the GOP Leadership in the Missouri House keeps its boot on the throat of Tea Party freshmen.
What a shame.
The party that was flat on its back from 2006 to 2009 rose back to power because of the tea party. But, it seems, the Missouri branch of the party didnât get the message. And its Speaker in the Missouri House has become tighter with left-fringe Democrats that with conservatives of his own party.</description>

      <description>In this disturbing video, an old union guy vividly describes tea-bagging to a 17-year-old high schooler. The reason? The kid had the audacity to hand out free US Constitutions.
As youâll see in the video from P/Oed Patriot and Sharp Elbows, the site of the Constitution at a union rally is like a crucifix and a pound of garlic in a vampire den. You can actually watch as the documentâs presence weakens the aging leftists.</description>

Todd is also a legitimate, committed member of the US House Tea Party Caucus. Todd Akin is the last politician who needs to prove his tea party cred. We trust him.

Akin Lives the Message
So when Todd Akin dashed from Springfield to Jefferson City to address the &amp;ldquo;Restore Common Senseâ rally on the south steps of the Missouri Capitol, he didnât do it to âproveâ anything.</description>

These arenât unions that represent people who work in mines and factories. No, these are unions representing people who live off your and my tax dollars. (BTW,the military doesnât have a union.)
So letâs see . . . The government does a bunch of stuff we donât want them to do. The people who did it get paid twice as much as the people who pay them.</description>

      <description>Letâs knock off the silly political correctness, here, and admit whatâs going in Wisconsin. The teachers are trying collapse the system.
The National Education Association is a radical, political organization whose primary purpose is not education but control. Threatened with sensible legislation that protects the people of Wisconsin from unsustainable and unjustified retirement benefits, these teachers decided to shut down Wisconsinâs schools.
The solution is simple. Do what Reagan did to PATCO.</description>

Our enemies see Obamaâs weakness as American weakness. As they did during Jimmy Carterâs failed presidency, those enemies are advancing.

 âI feel useful; Iâm independent,â said Ms. Ãlvarez, who opened a small cafe in November at her home in this scruffy town 25 miles from the capital, Havana. âWhen you sit down at the end of the day and look at how much you have made, you feel satisfied.</description>

      <description>When he identified the three branches of government as President, House, and Senate, Was Chuck Schumer confused, or did he accurately state the Obama administrationâs intent to subjugate the Judicial Branch of government? It seems the White House no longer considers the Judicial Branch the equal of the Executive.
In two casesâthe Gulf oil drilling ban and Obamacareâthe White House refuses to obey ruling from federal judges. In New Orleans, federal judge Martin Feldman found the White House in contempt for its re-imposition of oil drilling bans after his previous ruling to the contrary.</description>

Saul Alinsky warned radicals to ânever go outside the expertise of your people.â But desperate times call for desperate measures, so Obama jumped the shark to the time of Potsy and Fonzie and Joannie Loves Chachi to rekindle a flavor of Americana that died a couple of years before Obama was born.</description>

      <description>An old boss of mine liked âforcing functions.â Forced us to meet delivery dates, while arbitrary dates tended to cause a âso whatâ attitude toward deadlines. Forcing functions like trade shows, magazine reviews, and client launches forced development teams to ship, no matter what.
Keep that in mind for a moment while we look at the Obama Administration.
Barack Obama campaigned on a promise to clip Americaâs wings. I know he didnât use that term, but it was clear what he meant when he visited the Mediterranean and Germany.</description>

      <description>U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson today ruled Obamacare directly violates the Constitution by mandating that citizens buy health insurance.
This ruling goes further than the previous Virginia ruling. Judge Vinson declared the entire Obamacare bill unconstitutional because the individual mandate portion is not severable from the rest of the law.
Third, Judge Vinson granted the plaintiffs âdeclaratory relief,â the functional equivalent of an injunction, freeing them from the burden of compliance.</description>

There are some good conservatives who disagree over the Board of Police Commissioners for the City of St. Louis. Iâve heard some of these conservative make some strong arguments for abolishing the board or relinquishing it to St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay.
Some of the arguments in favor of so-called âhome ruleâ are flat out false.</description>

      <description>Just as in 2001, some Republicans are falling for Democrat mind games. In 2001, it was the shared leadership arrangement in the Senate, even thought the GOP had the majority because of the VP tie-break. This year, itâs beginning with âbi-partisanâ seating at the State of the Union address.
I have one message for Republicans: Knock it the hell off.
When a Democrat offers to reach across the aisle, with very few exceptions, itâs to poison a Republican.</description>

The direction is right.
The tactics and tools to keep the dominos falling to the right might change, but the energy and ideals donât. What brought you out to the tea parties, to the street parties, to the lit drops, and to the door knocking and phone banking parties must carry you forward in 2011 and 2012.</description>

1.Â We let them know whatâs important to us.
2.Â We defend themâindividually and collectivelyâwhen they do the right thing.

      <description>Itâs 2011. The Tea Party movement is almost two years old.
Two years after the Boston Tea party, the Revolutionary War was well underway. In April, 1775, British Lieutenant General Gage sent troops to Concord, Massachusetts, to seize a garrison held by revolutionaries. It didnât go so well for the Brits.

By 1776, the Continental Congress declared our independence from Great Britain citing human rights. With words that echo through the centuries, we declared that human beings have certain rights, and:</description>

 The issue with the Constitution is that the text is confusing because it was written more than a hundred years ago.

      <description>The year that ends tonight didnât begin a year a go tomorrow. Nor does it have a number.
Iâm not sure when this year started or what to call it. And, as surprising as it may sound, I donât think Iâll miss it.
Call it the year of the tea party. It lasted 22 months.
We accomplished only two things, really, in this massive human wave.
  We reminded ourselves that we, the people, can still roar.</description>

      <title>Despots Use Money to Buy Power</title>

      <description>Politicians donât seek money. They seek power. They use money to acquire power. Once they have the power, money becomes irrelevant.
Did you see how states behaved last summer? The âRace to the Topâ is all you need to know about the relationship between government money, power, and degradation.
The Race to the Top education initiative dangled cash in front of states. Most states, including Missouri, bit. They competed against each other for the privilege of surrendering their sovereignty over education to a DoE overlord.</description>

      <title>Chains of a Different Master</title>

      <description>Perhaps the most famous of all of Karl Marxâs writings was the clause âyou have nothing to lose but your chains.â
Many people still believe that human beings are chained to corporate masters. Writers like Seth Godin talk about an awakening in which workers refuse to remain cogs in someone elseâs machine.
These well-meaning people (some are well-meaning, anyway) have no problem, though with giving more power to a handful of slave-masters in Washington.</description>

      <description>I am a big fan of Seth Godinâs thinking. He clearly understands that people are rejecting steep hierarchies where an oligarchy makes all the decisions and the rest of us are expected to blindly follow instructions.
He wrote a wonderful book on the subject. Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?holds some wisdom (and some fallacy) that will empower you to take control of your life if you listen.
As I said, I like Sethâs thinking.</description>

      <title>3 reasons why young voters might make a right turn (and how we missed an opportunity with them)</title>

      <description>How many new voters has the tea party movement created? Thereâs reason to hope that first time voters will begin shifting to the right in 2010. Thereâs also reason for us on the right to worry.
About 8 million people turned 18 since the 2008 election. While the left undoubtedly brainwashed many of them before they reached voting age, many others avoided indoctrination through good parenting, good thinking, or simply not paying attention to the leftâs message.</description>

      <description>Dana Loesch invited Dick Morris onto her radio show today. Dana expected to discuss START with Mr. Morris. But Dick has a mind of his own.
Morris decided, about a minute and a half into a five-minute segment, that he wanted to talk about the 2012 US Senate race in Missouri instead. Specifically, he wanted spend the segment campaigning for Sarah Steelman for the the Republican nomination.
Decide for yourself: hereâs the link to Danaâs show.</description>

      <description>A man lost in thought is liable to say anything. Anything at all.
A guy sitting behind me at a restaurant in Lambert airport began singing along with the background music. âBurning down the house (do do).â
Perfect.

November 2, American voters burned down the U.S. House. Before the vote, estimates ranged from 45 to 70 seats switching from Democrats to Republicans. Burning down the house, indeed. The final number was 63.</description>

      <description>Conservatives (tea party, et al) and Republicans better learn to get along. Quickly. Just as quickly, the two need to recruit, vet, and prep some A-list candidates. Candidates for offices from President down to school boards.
Thatâs because the winners in 2012 will either belong to a conservative coalition or the most radical elements of the Democrat Party. Hereâs why.
Pollster Frank Luntz points out in todayâs Washington Post that the largest ideological faction in the United States is the combination of GOP plus tea partiers:</description>

      <description>Sometimes nightmares end well.
Sometimes they donât.
Salon carries a depressing story for the lower 48 of North America. Author Alfred McCoy writes:
 Despite the aura of omnipotence most empires project, a look at their history should remind us that they are fragile organisms. So delicate is their ecology of power that, when things start to go truly bad, empires regularly unravel with unholy speed: just a year for Portugal, two years for the Soviet Union, eight years for France, 11 years for the Ottomans, 17 years for Great Britain, and, in all likelihood, 22 years for the United States, counting from the crucial year 2003.</description>

      <description>We talk about liberty, limited government, freedom, Constitutional principles, and the like. Those are all relevant to the purposes of the conservative grassroots movement. But are they ends? Or are they just means?
I believe they are means. In the foundersâ writings we find clues to the end, even they donât state it explicitly. Jefferson did. Jay came close. And Adams implicitly understood that end.

Let me ask this: whatâs the point of all the work we did in the past two years?</description>

* Yesterday I noted the [inhumanity of Christmas shoppers](https://hennessysview.com/2010/11/28/our-disordered-society/) on Black Friday.** For the past 24 hours, the world has watched the slow release of hundreds of thousands of [classified US diplomatic cables](https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/sc-dc-1130-wikileaks-20101129,0,2557036.story).** As I write, [a gunman holds hostages](https://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/11/29/wisconsin.hostage/?hpt=T2) at a rural Wisconsin high school.** The [European debt crisis](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/11/29/europes_ominous_reckoning_108078.html) refuses to remain quiet beneath the rug under which itâs been swept.</description>

      <description>Exit polling tells the story. About 60 percent of voters agree with the tea party core principles of government constrained by a constitution and government transparency. Well over half of voters agree with specific measures advanced in the Contract From America, including:
  Balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.
  Elimination of earmarks until the budget is balanced, and then requiring a 2/3 vote.
  Audit the entire damn government, including the Fed.</description>

      <description>When you vote for a candidate for high office, sometimes you do so with fingers crossed. You just donât know how theyâll handle the new responsibilities. Will they succumb to pressure and influence? Or will they remain true?
Luckily for us, Senator-elect Roy Blunt showed his courage in a recent Wall Street Journal article about the Tea Party and the GOP.
In a year when voters overwhelming demanded changes to business as usual in Washington, Roy Blunt showed he has the rectitude to stand strong for the tried and true practices of obfuscation, political double-speak, and deflection.</description>

      <description>Three precincts in the city of St. Louis delivered 3,800 votes for Carnahan in the last hour of counting. Wahbyâs district. Wahbyâs wife works for Mayor Francis Slay. They waited until they knew how many votes they needed, then they manufactured them&amp;ndash;typical Dems, in my view.
Now I ask you: how many dead or non-existent people voted in Wahbyâs precincts?
Ed Martin won, and everyone knows it. City Democrats have no qualms with committing felonies to steal elections.</description>

      <description>Six hundred fourteen days from the first Tea Parties to Election Day. Thatâs 307 days in 2009 and 307 in 2010.
In that time, weâve met so many people. Weâve made too many friends. (Psychologists and sociologists and anthropologists believe that a person can manage no more than 150 human relationships, so there is such a thing as too many friends.) Most of us, Iâm afraid, have seen friendships end, too.</description>

      <description>In 47BC, Julius Caesar assumed dictatorial power in Rome. He instituted âreformsâ that transformed the Republic into the Empire. In the process, he became a dictator. Romeâs decent into oblivion began. In 44BC, seeing the damage Caesarâs tyranny and reforms, three men removed Caesar from power by the method of the day.
History moves faster now than it did 2,000 years ago. A megalomaniacal leaders bent on fundamentally transforming a nation can do remarkable damage in the blink of an eye.</description>

Totalitarian regimes despise beauty. They bury it in palaces where the rulers roam, their cancerous eyes raking over someoneâs masterpiece the way raw sewage pollutes a clear stream after a pipeâs failure.
Regimes, in their attempts to hoard beauty, bury it.

In the procession came trumpeteers, musicians and strange animals from conquered territories, together with carts laden with treasure and captured armaments. The conquerors rode in a triumphal chariot, the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him. Sometimes his children robed in white stood with him in the chariot or rode the trace horses.</description>

      <description>For 100 years in America, government, business, and the education establishment built schools and laws about education. The purpose of these government schools and education laws was to produce compliant, unimaginative, order-taking automatons.
Donât believe me? Hereâs Woodrow Wilson, educator and president, speaking on the American plan for education:
 We want one class of persons to have a liberal education, and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class of necessity in every society, to forgo the privilege of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks.</description>

      <description>For (at least) the past two nights, Glenn Beckâs program has been spell-bindingly depressing and eye-gougingly infuriating. Heâs chronicled the Obama administrationâs anti-Constitutional transfer of power and wealth from private Americans to other countries. Heâs shown that the administration has no concern over the 2010 election because it has no intention of obeying the laws passed by Congress.

For example, the newly appointed Consumer Protection Czar, a hard-line communist, Elizabeth Warren, is funded directly from the U.</description>

  They wonât face consequences.
  Problems arise when the people who thought they didnât want to think decide to think for themselves. Traditionally, the despots either kill or incarcerate the thinkers.
Eventually, too many people think, the prisons overflow, and the people kill or incarcerate the despot.
Instead of living through this cycle of violence again, why donât we stop the despot now?</description>

      <description>On November 5, 1980, ABC News Nightline was devoted to the aftermath of the election. Ronald Reagan won 51-41 over incumbent Jimmy Carter. Republicans took the Senate and picked up 30+ seats in the house.
The YouTube clip below shows us only the beginning of the program. But itâs a great reminder of what lies ahead for movement conservatives. Well, what lies ahead IF we continue to focus on moving the conversation toward first principles and away from the class warfare and Balkanization that Democrats love so much.</description>

      <description>Yes, there are three major Tea Party events on 9-12: Washington, Sacramento, and St. Louis. But if you canât see the Atlantic or the Pacific from your window, why donât you make the trip to the middle of the country, to the âGateway to Novemberâ Tea Party under the Arch?

Iâm hearing from groups in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Iowa, and many from Illinois and Kansas who CANNOT WAIT for the 9-12 &amp;ldquo;Gateway to November&amp;rdquo; Tea Party in St.</description>

      <description>Barney Frank Comes Home to the Facts.
Remarkable. Is this is a true change in heart, a real wising-up, of one of Congress&amp;rsquo;s biggest Fannie and Freddie supporters? Or is Barney Frank playing some angle here.
Let&amp;rsquo;s hope it&amp;rsquo;s the former. The best thing for America would be an awakening among big government Democrats. Imagine if Frank became a deficit hawk and a Tenther!.</description>

      <description>I approached the Rennick Park Pavilion with a heavy heart for three reasons. At least three.
First, it was yet another night that I would not be home. And tomorrowâs first day of school. The last first day of school for my son, Patrick. I canât think of that without thinking about his first day of kindergartenâwhich seems like yesterdayâwhen he insisted on riding the bus. With his little backpack overflowing with supplies listed on a green sheet of paper (Rockwood-Green Pines-K), he stepped onto that bus in August of 1998.</description>

      <description>One of the most popular and most talked about movies of 1993 was Falling Down, starring Michael Douglas, Barbara Hershey, and Robert Duval.
Douglas played William âD-FENSâ Foster, an engineer at a defense contractor who has a really bad day. Some described the movie as âan ordinary man at war with the everyday world.â
Foster became an iconic anti-hero for the people who (stealing Bill Clintonâs line)worked hard and played by the rules, yet found themselves at the bottom of the heap in the post-Cold War era of 1993.</description>

      <description>Congressional Democrats plan to hold a special session in August to pass yet another $26 billion bailout for states. Specifically for states that have create welfare empires they can no longer sustain.
So responsible states now have to pay for irresponsible states at the point of a federal gun.
It looks like the Democrats want to completely bankrupt America before they lose power in January.
Of course, this also gives empty suits like Russ Carnahan an excuse not to debate their opponents, talk to constituents, or hold town halls.</description>

I honestly believe that in the St. Louis area, the rightward-most, viable candidate won each of the key votes. The people of Missouri are in a position to make historical shifts in our Washington representation. And those shifts are just the first step and restoring Americaâs First Principles.

In 1994, Dan Rostenkowski, then Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, was convicted of felony fraud charges.

In 2010, Charlie Rangel, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is found guilty of ethics violations. (And BO says itâs time for him to go.)
In 1994, Democrats were on the ropes after winning the House, the Senate, and the White House.

      <description>Steven Lipstein is president of BJC Hospitals. He is part of well-funded, national campaign to deny Missourians the right to NOT purchase something they donât want.
In a preposterous letter to his employees, Lipstein attempts to argue that human beings have no right to say ânoâ to health insurance. As self-anointed overlord of our spending, Lipstein questions the very foundations of Americaâs guiding philosophy when he writes:
 Can a citizen decide not to buy health care services, and with that decision, not be required to buy health insurance?</description>

      <description>Just before her beatification, Shirley Sherrod jumped the shark.

On Thursday, CNNâs Anderson Cooper let the embattled former USDA director talk for an hour. Bad idea. It was bad for CNN, bad for viewers, and really bad for Sherrod, who lost her mind on the air. This is what she said:
 I think heâd [Andrew Breitbart would] like to get us stuck back in the times of slavery, Thatâs where I think heâd like to see all black people end up again.</description>

      <description>Have you noticed few people call Barack Obama âThe Oneâ anymore? âThe Golferâ or âThe Vacationerâ is more like it. Something less than One, by any measure.

Still, with each passing day and each new, permanent crisis, it seems like BO just ainât up to the job of President. Nothing new. When Jimmy Carterâs incompetence became obvious, the lefty press developed a theory that the job had simply grown too complex for one man.</description>

      <description>The NAACP has decided that itâs worth time to call 20 million American patriots âracistsâ for advancing liberty and economic opportunity.
At midnight, the St. Louis Tea Party Coalition sent a resolution condemning the NAACPâs bigotry and hatred to its Washington bureau.
The Tea Partyâs principles are simple and clear:
* Smaller federal government** Lower taxes** Fiscal responsibility** National defense** Federalism  Those are precisely the tools to lift all Americans out of poverty.</description>

      <description>Democrats are planning to punish the American people with draconian, destructive legislation during the lame duck session following Novemberâs election, according the Wall Street Journal.
 That&amp;rsquo;s why there have been signs in recent weeks that party leaders are planning an ambitious, lame-duck session to muscle through bills in December they don&amp;rsquo;t want to defend before November. Retiring or defeated members of Congress would then be able to vote for sweeping legislation without any fear of voter retaliation.</description>

Ms. Noonan reflected on the Townhall Revolt which began in St. Louis one year ago. Writes Noonan:

The poll does not include any mention of Republican candidate Chuck Purgason. Purgason seems to be enjoying something of a surge. Heâs doffed his toupee and traded the Bolo tie for a regular one. And Purgasonâs released a radio commercial in key areas around the state.
Rasmussen finds strong support for Roy Blunt among those who consider themselves tea partyers:</description>

As Jim Durbin points out, last nightâs St. Louis Tea Party Night at the Ball Game was a total fluke. A mix-up left us with 46 tickets to last nightâs Cardinalâs game against Arizona. (Long story.) But this tea party thing that started over a year ago seems to generate its own publicity.

But the real story, to me, is what happened last night. Three incidents vindicated the shift toward more community building work, even if that work comes at the expense of big, boisterous rallies.</description>

 I&amp;rsquo;m doing it because I said I was going to do it and I think it&amp;rsquo;s the right thing to do. People should learn that lesson about me because next year when I start presenting some very difficult choices to the country, I hope some of these folks who are hollering about deficits and debt step-up because I&amp;rsquo;m calling their bluff.</description>

I do.Â I am concerned that we keep repeating the same tactics to the same audiences until both the audience and the actors becomeÂ . . . well, bored.
When I read stories like this one, that GOP sentiment is at an all-time high, I worry that some on our side might decide they can go back to their regularly scheduled programming.</description>

      <description>The Tea Party phenomenon has been with us for almost a year and a half already. We finally made it to the pages of Americaâs most venerable . . . um, girly magazine.
_Rogues of K Street _is an anonymous Washington insiderâs view of the most effective and expansive political movement in at least half a century.
While the author may have overstated my contributions to the cause, the expose is important for historical purposes.</description>

      <description>You would think that the basement of the White House was gushing 60,000 barrels of oil a day, wouldnât you? After all, President Obamaâs entire response to the greatest ecological disaster of modern times has been empower Washington, DC.
The disasters are in the Gulf of Mexico, Mr. President, and in the latest Gallup and Rasmussen polls.
Politicians who worship at the alter of omnipotent government have no answers to problems outside of government.</description>

In less than twenty-four hours, the left has demonstrated its incapacity for civilized living by physically assaulting a college student, then exclaiming the virtues of physical assaults on reporters.
Background
A Democrat member of Congress assaulted a college student. The assault, shown on two video angles, was unprovoked (unless asking a simple, closed question is now cause for violence) andcontinuing long past the point at which the victim said stop.</description>

      <description>A Washington Post/ABC News poll shows a major shift in sentiment toward (against?) the tea party movement.
I would not challenge the accuracy of the results which show the tea partyâs popularity waning among Southerners and people 18 to 29. In fact, the poll shows that a full 50 percent of Americans now have a negative view of the tea party.
Sure, there may have been some chicanery with the questions to skew the results.</description>

      <title>4 Steps to Launch Conservative Revolution</title>

      <description>Thirty-two years ago this month, the modern conservative movement was born.
The movement began with a local issue in a single state.Â Howard Jarvis of California succeeded in rolling back that stateâs property taxes. Voters ignored Governor Jerry Brownâs apocalyptic predictions and captured the imaginations of a nation. After decades of government growth, the people of Americaâs largest state said, âEnough!â

As economist Stephen Moore wrote on cato.org a dozen years ago:</description>

      <description>Supporting Obama now seen as . . . naive nostalgia.
     It is an irony of Obama&amp;rsquo;s presidency - which came into being because he was the unBush - that it shares some of the worst traits of his predecessor&amp;rsquo;s administration. Among these are insularity and a blinkered arrogance.
    Obama has never been wracked by self-doubt and he is unusually self-contained for a politician.</description>

      <description>Seth Godin is one of my favorite writers, thinkers, marketers, and presenters. Everything he writes is worth your time reading. Two of his books stand out for me. One is Tribes, because Tribes describes the whole Tea Party experience perfectly. And he wrote it a year before the Tea Party things started.
Right now, though, my other favorite Godin book serves as a question and a guide for the Tea Party movement.</description>

      <description>A few weeks back, the Christian Science Monitor asked me to write an op-ed. The subject was, âIf the Tea Party ran America, how would things change; and why do you think youâll win?â
The call was my opportunity to break from the easy, unassailable position that things are bad and getting worse. It meant coming up with a solution or two.Â And solutions already find disagreement somewhere.
For over a year Iâve said that the Tea Party movement, begun out of anger, must shift its energy over time from anger to solutions.</description>

      <description>It took almost three years of Jimmy Carterâs dangerously naive worldview before the world rushed in. By ârushed in,â I mean the Soviet Union rushed into Afghanistan, Iranian radicals rushed into the US Embassy in Tehran, and Cuban-backed communists rushed into every Central and South American country they could.
These aggressions resulted from a world perception that Jimmy Carter was unwilling to use Americaâs arsenal for good. Additionally, following Vietnam and observing American culture, the world surmised that:</description>

      <description>Barack Obamaâs incompetent, confused, and contradictory handling of the Gulf oil spill reveals a man unfit for any position of authority.
As Peggy Noonan pointed out in a painfully honest Wall Street Journal column on May 28, we know now that Barack Obama is an empty suit, a child playing grown-up.
 I wonder if the president knows what a disaster this is not only for him but for his political assumptions.</description>

      <description>Dana Loesch and 24th State have revealed the ring of corruption that extends from St. Louis bloggers and local St. Louis leftist rag, through SEIU, to Media Matters and Huffington Post.
An additional crook in this den of thieves is Democrat Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Casey has introduced yet another bailout package. This time, the bailout is intended to repay corrupt unions like SEIU and AFL-CIO for bankrupting their membersâ retirements by bribing the media and politicians.</description>

      <description>Interesting. Mounting evidence suggests [the White House may have been complicit](If so, even Democrats in Congress would be forced to open impeachment investigations) in SEIUâs terrorism (as defined by U.S. Patriot Act) of a bankerâs teenage son.

Quit the SEIU. No decent person would belong to an organization that openly, and with the federal governmentâs approval, uses terrorism to get its way.
Quit the DC Metro Police Force. The President is using you to promote domestic terrorism.</description>

      <description>Whether youâre the party darling or the federal office holder, 2010 is shaping up to be yourÂ last year in politics.
In Kentucky, Tea Party Republican, Rand Paul, opened a can of whoop-ass on Republican party favorite, Trey Grayson. No single race proves the strength or impact of the Tea Party, but races like Paulâs demonstrate that the right candidate with the right campaign team with the strong backing of the Tea Party and 9-12 Project can blow away the party candidate.</description>

      <description>The final poll before Tuesdayâs special election to fill Jack Murthaâs unexpired seat in the U.S. House shows that Republican Tim Burns is neck and neck with Democrat and pork barrel specialist Mark Critz. (Yes, Critzâs campaign is funded by lobbyists and special interests.)

PPP has it 48 to 47 Burns.
That means GOTV will determine the winner.

      <description>In Tennessee and Arizona, insurance exchanges created under ObamaCare are barred from covering abortions. Pro-life groups claim this trend will continue as more states realize that the bill passed earlier this year allows states to block abortion coverage by private exchanges. (Missouriâs legislature sent a similar measure to Gov. Jay Nixon.)

Pro-abortion members of Congress are incensed, according to the Associated Press and Fox News:
 &amp;ldquo;Implementation of this reform should be about increasing access to health care and increasing choices, not taking them away,&amp;rdquo; said Sen.</description>

 But there&amp;rsquo;s also one big reason why the Democrats may just pull it out- and why Republicans may not have as big an election year as we&amp;rsquo;re anticipating. And that&amp;rsquo;s because only 26% of voters in the district have a favorable opinion of Congressional Republicans, with 56% seeing them unfavorably.</description>

      <description>For the record, I do not apologize for focusing on the most important battles facing self-government since the American Revolution.

Earlier this week, McGraw Milhaven of 550 KTRS criticized Tea Partyers for not opposing Missouri legislation, introduced by and championed by Republicans, that will force insurance companies to cover treatment for children diagnosed with Autism and associated conditions.Â (I personally oppose this legislation, by the way.)
Before that, a few Tea Partyers criticized me and others on facebookÂ for not doing âenoughâ to support the Missouri Healthcare Free Choice act, which recently passed both the House and the Senate.</description>

One path requires constant vigilance against distraction. This path also demands great awareness of many things, knowledge, and outlandish tenacity. This is the path we recognize as heroic.
The other path gets less notice, less acclaim. Those how follow this other path to focus donât seem to try hard. These are the ânaturals.â Things seem to come easy for them.</description>

      <description>Hey, one of our favorite members of Congress, and a true gentleman, Todd Akin (R-MO), has made the front page of BigGovernment.com.
The Obama Justice Department is quietly investigating the lawyers associated with the John Adams Project who may have violated a number of laws in place to protect our covert operatives and their families. But so far, with few exceptions, the media and their friends on Capitol Hill havenât found this case nearly as interesting as Valerie Plame.</description>

In human relations, there is a fixed ratio between leaders and those they lead.
The people trust leaders as much as the leader trusts the people.
In my lifetime, no leader ever trusted me as much as Ronald Reagan.
And I have trusted no leader as much as I trusted him.
And we never even met.</description>

      <description>Earlier I linked to Glenn Reynoldsâs Examiner column about the hard work that lies ahead for Tea Partyers. If you havenât read that piece, do so after reading this.
At Tea Party marches and rallies, we are surrounded by others who understand and cherish liberty. We know the horrors that occur when a government loses accountability to and, yes, fear of the people they govern. Such regimes become murderous, intolerant, and repressive.</description>

      <description>No, General Motors did not pay back its debt to taxpayers. Edward Whitacre is a liar. Instead, Whitacre paid the Visa bill with his MasterCard.Â But both cards were issued by the same bank.Â So you, the banker, are still on the hook for the full amount.
Now we know why Obama hand-picked Ed Whitacre to âleadâ GM: Whitacre will do the presidentâs bidding.

UPDATE From Hotair.com: New York Times agrees that Whitacre and White House ain&amp;rsquo;t tellin&amp;rsquo; the truth.</description>

      <description>I once thought that focus meant you never got distracted. I was wrong.
A person with a powerful focusing ability gets as distracted as the next guy. The difference is that the Focus Master has learned to recognize distraction and gently guide his thoughts or actions back to the intended task at hand.
That simple skill is rare and remarkably powerful. Pay attention to every word of this two-step process:</description>

Top names on the boycott list:
 * Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson * T-Mobile * Ford * Nissan/Infiniti * Toyota/Lexus * Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble * Citigroup (which should be out of business, anyway) * Chase (JPMC) * The Gap (plus Old Navy and Banana Republic) * Wyeth * Saturn * Hotels.</description>

I will be at Forest Park.
So I have some strong disagreements with some of the sponsoring organizations of the counter-rally. Big deal. If the point of the counter-rally is to oppose Nazism, then I can easily look past those differences for a couple of hours.</description>

      <description>Barack Obamaâs shameful and anti-American behavior this past weekend in Europe deserves the kind of scorn reserved for degenerate traitors like Benedict Arnold, the Rosenbergs, and Alger Hiss.
On Thursday in London, the President of the United States transferred Americaâs economic sovereignty from we, the people, to a small group of European central bankers.
In the words of former Clinton staffer Dick Morris, Obama ânullified the Declaration of Independence.â Specifically, Obama signed an agreement to create the Financial Stability Board comprised of European central banks and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.</description>

      <description>Barack Obama has asserted his dictatorial powers by firing GM CEO Rick Waggoner. The firing of a companyâs chief executive by a US president should send chills down the spine of every American. This is totalitarianism defined.
While Hennessyâs View has been critical of Waggonerâs leadership at GM, we oppose illegal and unconstitutional dictatorial powers in the hands of any US president.
Nothing in the Constitution permits a sitting president to direct a private company.</description>

      <description>Rasmussen&amp;rsquo;s weekly report shows the Tea Party message of limited government and lower taxes is hitting home with voters.
Tax Cuts: More voters than ever now say tax cuts help the economy. Over 60 percent now agree with JFK, Reagan, Bush, and the undeniable facts of economic history: cutting taxes increases GDP and personal wealth.  A separate survey releasedÂ earlier todayÂ found that 66% of voters think the president is likely to raise taxes on those who make less than $250,000 per year.</description>

But when we were dating, my wife gave me the best advice I&amp;rsquo;ve ever received: If you really want to cut someone down, say at least one good thing about them, and make it sound sincere. For that reason, I keep in mind that Barack Obama is a fantastic communicator.
Until tonight.

Thatâs right. Obama is going to turn your kids into spies working against you and your elderly parents. Why? Because Marxists like Obama hate liberty. Liberty is their enemy. And you support liberty, then you&amp;rsquo;re the enemy, too.
Now, before you say Iâm reaching, read the language.

Obama personifies absurdity. Take this headline for example:
Obama Seeks to Lower Expectations (WSJ, 2/19/2009)
Trust me, Mr. President; my expectations of you could not get any lower.
Or this:
House Passes Tax on Wall St. Bonuses (WSJ, 2/19/2009)

Thatâs America today. In the leadership vacuum created when the left eviscerated George W. Bush in 2006, Americaâs precarious imbalance seems improbable. Impossible.
Perhaps it is.
Likely it is.

 The leader of the nation&amp;rsquo;s largest veterans organization says he is &amp;ldquo;deeply disappointed and concerned&amp;rdquo; after a meeting with President Obama today to discuss a proposal to force private insurance companies to pay for the treatment of military veterans who have suffered service-connected disabilities and injuries. The Obama administration recently revealed a plan to require private insurance carriers to reimburse the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in such cases.</description>

      <description>Rasmussen&amp;rsquo;s daily Presidential Approval Tracking numbers continue to show that Obama has lost more support in his first 50 days than any president since polling began.

Among the many factors contributing to Obama&amp;rsquo;s falling popularity, in my view, is his scattershot approach to the economy, inability to recruit and retain talent, and strong leftward lurch since taking office.
Americans do not want socialism. I hear over and over from disenchanted Obama voters that they didn&amp;rsquo;t believe he was a leftist as some on the right made him out to be during the campaign.</description>

I know this is a little late, but I was waiting for Congress to spend another trillion dollars or so before committing my prediction to the public.Â Here goes:
GDP and unemployment will flatten and even improve a bit in first half of 2009 for a couple of reasons:
First, people will begin to look for excuses to spend money.Â This includes businesses.
Second, the hideous transfer of power from individuals to government that passed Congress on Friday will have a psychological effect on people making some believe that things will get better soon.</description>

      <description>Tonight on &amp;ldquo;The O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Factor,&amp;rdquo; liberal journalist Juan Williams sided with O&amp;rsquo;Reilly and Bernard Goldberg in ripping the left-wing smear machine.
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s real, and I&amp;rsquo;m a victim of it. I have the scars to prove it,&amp;rdquo; Williams told O&amp;rsquo;Reilly.
The left-wing smear machine includes The New York Times, Daily Kos, and others. As Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s forthcoming book, &amp;ldquo;A Slobbering Love Affair,&amp;rdquo; points out, this smear machine is a loosely but skillfully orchestrated consortium of radical, anti-American organizations that seeks, not just win at the polls, but to eliminate conservatism and Constitutional government.</description>

      <description>Request:Â If you read a blog post on Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View that seems to be rooting for America to fail or suffer in order that Obama take the blame, please e-mail me (bill-at&amp;ndash;hennessysview&amp;ndash;dot&amp;ndash;com) and comment.Â I&amp;rsquo;m a hot-head, and I might not catch myself.
The United States and every country on earth is in a perilous position right now.Â The world economy is on the brink of depression.Â Bad business practices driven by even worse government policies and regulations have destroyed $ trillions in wealth and left us on a narrow, swampy peninsula between deflation and hyperinflation.</description>

      <description>The first time I met George W. Bush in person, I was campaigning for Jack Kemp for President.Â Kemp was running against Vice President George H. W. Bush (and 47 others) for the Republican nomination.Â This was 1987.
A wonderful, tough, and tireless local Republican organizer named Thelma Stuart recruited me and served as my mentor in Dixiecrat-style politics of South Carolina.Â My first gig was manning the Kemp booth at the Low Country Stump Days in Charleston.</description>

      <description>American Thinker Blog: Global Warm-mongering: More Silk from a Pig&amp;rsquo;s Ear
 It seems that NASA&amp;rsquo;s James Hansen, head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), is at it again. He just can&amp;rsquo;t let the data speak for itself. In yet another egregious display of Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) arrogance, he changed the temperature data from 1910-2008 to reflect what is clearly a cooling trend to reflect a warming trend.</description>

      <description>Obama: &amp;lsquo;Trillion-Dollar Deficits For Years&amp;rsquo; - Capital Commerce (usnews.com)
 Just mindblowing. Here is #44 today (via the AP):
 Obama said Tuesday the deficit appears on track to hit $1 trillion soon. Speaking to reporters after meeting with top economic aides, Obama said: &amp;quot;Potentially we&#39;ve got trillion-dollar deficits for years to come, even with the economic recovery that we are working on.&amp;quot;  If Obama really believes that the world economy will tolerate annual deficits north one trillion dollars, he will receive a belated economics education in short order.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s give credit where it&amp;rsquo;s due, if it&amp;rsquo;s due.
If Barack Obama sends a $300 billion tax cut proposal to Congress as the meat of his stimulus package, he deserves high marks.
Tax Cuts Increase Tax Revenue
A large tax cut aimed at tax payers&amp;ndash;individual and business alike&amp;ndash;will not only stimulate the economy, it will increase federal revenue, defraying the irresponsible and dangerous spending of Paulson and Bernanke. As Kennedy, Reagan, and Bush 43 understood, tax cuts, to a point, increase federal revenue.</description>

      <description>Entitlement is the psychological abnormality in which a person believes that he is owed an enrichment or compensation earned by suffering or activity and that society or government is obligated to pay. It is a psychological condition. It is abnormal&amp;ndash;or should be.
When a team of governors demands that the federal government steal wages and profits of the citizens and transfer those monies to state governors to dispense as the governors see fit, one wonders whether or not the disease is now the norm.</description>

      <description>In a just world where all men are created with equal rights, Bernie Madoff would be a hero. More than any other private sector figure, Bernie Madoff perfectly embodies the new American ideal.
What Madoff Did
Bernie Madoff admitted to investigators that he created an enormous Ponzi&amp;ndash;or pyramid&amp;ndash;scheme. He promised investors very high returns. He made good by paying of Round 1 investors with Round 2&amp;rsquo;s money.

As long as a new generation of investors, larger than the previous, lines up to invest, everything&amp;rsquo;s good.</description>

The Dow: The Dow trades within a range of 1,000 points with a daily average closing of 8,500.
GDP and Economy: By July, everyone pretty much calls the situation &amp;ldquo;Great Depression II.&amp;rdquo; Unemployment, which declines in the first quarter, increases to more than 12 percent by fall. Gross Domestic Product by quarter:</description>

      <description>Hey, folks, I haven&amp;rsquo;t read the whole thing.Â But in the second paragraph we seem to find the answer to whole global warming problem:Â ignore it.
 First, all over the world, temperatures have been dropping in a way wholly unpredicted by all those computer models which have been used as the main drivers of the scare. Last winter, as temperatures plummeted, many parts of the world had snowfalls on a scale not seen for decades.</description>

      <description>The increased urgency to legislate or judicially impose new, draconian burdens on society to &amp;ldquo;save the planet&amp;rdquo; is not your imagination. Neither is it a response to increasingly rising temperatures. Temperatures have been falling for 8 years now, and have not risen in more than 10. The reason the AGW alarmists need to impose restrictions is: credit.Â Remember the ozone holes? According to leftists, the holes were caused by chloroflourocarbons like refrigerant used in air conditioning.</description>

      <description>Obama Intelligence Pick Torpedoed By Bloggers - FOXNews.com Transition Tracker
 John Brennan, Obama&amp;rsquo;s chief intelligence adviser and anticipated CIA chief, was recently forced to withdraw his name. There was no drumbeat of opposition to Brennan from the front pages or on cable. Rather, the pick was torpedoed by the blogosphere.
 &amp;ldquo;Apparently there is a lot of pressure on the Obama team from a blog saying that Brennan couldn&amp;rsquo;t be made the director of the CIA because he was involved in torture and renditions, which he wasn&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; said Mark Lowenthal, former assistant CIA director.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Wall Street Journal directly contradict&amp;rsquo;s Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s claim to have never discussed his Senate replacement:
 Barack Obama had begun thinking about his Senate successor even before the presidential election, and dispatched Rahm Emanuel days after the vote to contact aides of Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich to begin talking up Mr. Obama&amp;rsquo;s preferred candidates, associates of Mr. Emanuel said this weekend.
 Remember that Obama also claimed that no one on his staff or acting on his behalf discussed the seat with Blago.</description>

      <description>The United Auto Workers is the sort of extortion racket that gives crime a bad name. For 40 years&amp;ndash;since the introduction of Japanese cars in the US market&amp;ndash;these whining, overpaid slobs have bilked consumers for billions, insisting that they deserve to be overpaid simply because there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of them. America would be better off if the UAW simply ceased to exist.
They make the bogus claim that they are better workers than their non-union counterparts who assemble BMWs, Hondas, Nissans, and Toyotas.</description>

The plan includes a car czar&amp;ndash;something that Toyata, Nissan, and Honda miraculously do not need&amp;ndash;to run the auto industry like a DMV license office. The last time a government designed, built, and sold an automobile like, it was called the Yugo. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep my SUV, thanks.</description>

Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich did the perp walk for his Chicago neighbors this morning.Â Others have written plenty about the facts of the indictment (here, here, here, here, and here).Â You should know two things:
1.Â There&amp;rsquo;s a chance Obama will pardon Blagojevich before he goes to court.Â Why?Â Because Obama is too close not to.Â Blagojevich is NOT AN HONORABLE CROOK.</description>

      <description>Would you believe me if I told you that capitalism would end in America, not by government seizure, but by surrender of the capitalists themselves?Â Are we really witnessing our largest businesses asking the government to save them from themselves?

      <description>Robert Rubin was a key player in keeping Enron afloat while he and his cronies fleeced billions from employees and investors.
Robert Rubin abandoned the Clinton administration when a recession was unavoidable. His relief was his protege, Larry Summers.
Robert Rubin talked the Citigroup board into investing in extremely high-risk mortgage-backed securities. He also showed the bank how to carry those risks off the books&amp;ndash;exactly the way he showed Enron how to do it.</description>

      <description>This is not tongue-in-cheek or flippant.
We can find two good results of the terrorist siege of Mumbai, India.
First, Rabbi Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg&amp;rsquo;s baby son, Moshe, escaped alive. Good people have set up a fund for the child where you can contribute. Please do so. The child&amp;rsquo;s survival seems to destine him for greatness, as the story contains odd parallels to the story of Moses.
Second, the tragic events forced organizers to cancel Live Earth India, a pagan celebration to spread the lie of Anthropogenic Global Warming.</description>

      <description>According to Tweeters in the streets of Mumbai outside Nariman House, the Jewish Center, NSG Commandos (Indian special forces) are high-fiving people in the streets. The crowds are singing patriot songs. No gunfire.
Meanwhile, 30 or more bodies were found in the Oberoi hotel.
I hope the West takes a lesson from NSG&amp;rsquo;s fierce, straight-on attack on the terrorists.
Also, have you noticed that our Western, pro-terrorist media (CNN, NY Times, LA Times, MSNBC) refuse to call the Mumbai terrorists &amp;ldquo;terrorists?</description>

      <description>Since no one else will listen to his lies, half-science, and hysteria, the old man of GISS wrote a long letter to the president-elect.
Luckily for the rational world, Richard Courtney (pdf) excoriated Hansen for the letter and for Hansen&amp;rsquo;s continued crusade to end freedom as we know it. Courtney&amp;rsquo;s summary of Hansen&amp;rsquo;s conclusion may go down in annuls of the AGW debate as a masterpiece:
 That &amp;ldquo;conclusion&amp;rdquo; may be correct if it were based on evidence and reasoned argument, but - as explained above - it is not.</description>

      <description>Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats could be headed toward a final showdown over abortion and the right of men and women to choose their moral direction.
Obama has promised in bold and belligerent words to make the Freedom of Choice Act his first, most important act as President. Consistent with his lifelong passion for encouraging abortion, even encouraging his daughters to have abortions, Obama&amp;rsquo;s first act as President will be to drive a permanent wedge between the United States and the Catholic church.</description>

Thatcher rose to the top of British government in response to decades of expensive, debilitating leftward drift in Europe. The countries of NATO faced a long series of self-inflicted financial crises, the KGB incited their youth toward socialism and Sovietphilia, and taxes were out of control.</description>

      <description>The US Government is now on the hook for $7.7 trillion in bailouts and guarantees trying to stave another Great Depression [source]. Mathematically, the government&amp;rsquo;s scheme cannot work.
Bailout Costs in Perspective
World War II cost about $2.1 trillion in 1990 dollars, which I calculate to be $3.5 trillion in 2008 (assuming 2.8 percent inflation over the period.). (San Francisco Chronicle puts a $5 trillion tag on WWI, though.) It took 50 years to pay off that debt.</description>

      <description>A federal bailout for the Big Three auto manufacturers will be direct transfer of wealth from the middle class to the upper class. Auto workers are, by Joe Biden&amp;rsquo;s definition, &amp;ldquo;wealthy.&amp;rdquo;
Union auto workers more than the average executive manager with an MBA and nearly 3 times the wage of the average teacher with a master&amp;rsquo;s degree. That&amp;rsquo;s why the Big 3 are dying, and that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what the unions deserve.</description>

      <description>Once responsible companies are now basing decision critical decisions on government handouts. This is this is an expected, but unplanned for, result of the Paulson&amp;rsquo;s Panic in September. Says the Wall Street Journal:

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve received some notes and e-mails from friends who say I&amp;rsquo;m overboard in my rhetoric about Obama&amp;rsquo;s potential to communize the USA. I respect them, but they&amp;rsquo;re simply wrong.
In Philadelphia, you can be arrested simply for wearing McCain-Palin t-shirts, as proven in this video.
And these are Philly&amp;rsquo;s finest, not Obama&amp;rsquo;s promised jack-booted thugs.
Be vigilant, America. Sleep with one eye open. Remember the words of William Wallace in the movie Braveheart:</description>

      <description>Dr. Hansen apparently believes the world is as stupid as, well, as stupid as the world seems to be.
All of the October surface station temperature from Russia was corrupted. So what did Hansen do? He simply copied and pasted Russia&amp;rsquo;s temperatures for September into October and reported that October 2008 was the hottest October on record.
Why isn&amp;rsquo;t James Hansen in prison? The AGW argument has lost so much steam that he&amp;rsquo;s resorted this level of lying, fraud, and deceit.</description>

A palpable fear shook my psyche. Its reverberations echo in my heart and soul some 28 years later, the way some scientists claim the Big Bang can still be heard pin-balling around the universe.
I allowed myself a few days to digest the reality of last week&amp;rsquo;s election.</description>

      <description>From Rich Lowry (editor of National Review) to Norman Ornstein (American Enterprise Institute), conservatives cry out for &amp;ldquo;message that resonates with young people and minorities.&amp;rdquo;
Hogwash.
Barack Obama won the election because, given the choice of two vacuous and banal &amp;ldquo;messages,&amp;rdquo; voters went with the more interesting one.
Blaming conservatism, Reagan, Christians, and clingers for the 2008 election results betrays a kind of ignorance for which non-profits raise funds to cure.</description>

      <description>Most enduring political truths are exposed and accessible in the 1995 Mel Gibson classic Braveheart: freedom, eros, love of country, sacrifice, loss, anger, vengeance, lust, hatred,betrayal, evil, and everything in between. Conservatives should see moderate Republicans in the character of Robert the Bruce&amp;rsquo;s leper father.
 &amp;ldquo;You admire this man, this William Wallace. Uncompromising men are easy to admire. He has courage; so does a dog. But it is exactly the ability to &amp;lsquo;compromise&amp;rsquo; that makes a man noble.</description>

      <description>According to reports, Barack Obama will spend most of the afternoon of January 20, 2009, signing Executive Orders to ban or limit activities that produce CO2. Bankrupting the coal and steel industries apparently can&amp;rsquo;t wait for legislative action.
Why the rush? Why is Obama in such a hurry to put tens of thousands of people out of work?
Obama and the left want to get CO2 laws in place so they can claim the laws stopped and reversed global warming.</description>

      <description>Ignorance is no defense.
Americans, faced with the choice of Marxist-socialism or republican-capitalism, a plurality chose communism.
Their moral weakness, combined with viral corruption of character, has created a majority coalition of indecisive morons known as independents, children who want government to make their decisions and butter their bread, and neo-Marxists, like Obama. We fought the Cold War for nothing.
Over the next two years, we will see the most complete change in a nation seen since the Bolshevik Revolution nearly 100 years ago in Russia:</description>

 Team Obama is busily preparing to dash his supporters&amp;rsquo; hope for change should he win the presidential election on Tuesday. Even in the final days before the election, the pressure to deliver on his lofty promises has Obama attempting to dampen expectations on the campaign trail:

      <description>In almost every toss-up, battleground state in the country, there remainsa mass of undecided voters who must decide whether socialism or freedom will prevail. They must make this decision by 7:00 p.m. Tuesday. They better not take it lightly.
If Barack Obama wins, America will no longer be a free country when anyone can grow up to be President or CEO of a company. We know this by Obama&amp;rsquo;s writings and words and those of his Congressional allies.</description>

      <description>Among the many Marxist police state features in Obama&amp;rsquo;s extra-Constitutional America is the Civilian Security Force. (Hat tip Gateway Pundit) I&amp;rsquo;m not kidding.
According to Obama himself this force will be armed and funded as heavily as the US Armed Forces. Unlike the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marines, this force will aim its destructive power on political dissidents.
&amp;ldquo;We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we&amp;rsquo;ve set,&amp;rdquo; Dear Leader said Wednesday.</description>

      <description>At the current rate of decline in Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s definition of &amp;ldquo;the rich,&amp;quot; by June 2009, anyone earning more than $20,136 a year will get a tax increase.
Since July 2008, Obama&amp;rsquo;s definition of rich has been declining at rate of 20 percent per month. Simple extrapolation shows that even minimum wage earners will face a tax increase by the time any legislation can be enacted in June 2009.
In other words, Obama&amp;rsquo;s real definition of &amp;ldquo;rich&amp;rdquo; is: &amp;ldquo;you have a job.</description>

Some call the Friday poll an anomaly, but there&amp;rsquo;s reason to believe it&amp;rsquo;s not.
Joe the Plumber and Tito the Builder resonate with an increasing number of voters. These are ordinary Americans who work hard to make a better life for their families.

 Obama has been encouraging voters to go to the polls for early voting. The Democratic nominee . . . released a new 30-second spot on his Web site urging voters to &amp;ldquo;talk to your boss&amp;rdquo; or professor and then take the day off from work or school to volunteer for his campaign on Election Day.</description>

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t.

      <description>In an NPR interview in 2001, Barack Obama admitted that he despises the US Constitution because it limits government. He stated that the Warren Court did not go far enough in redistributing wealth.Â In essence, the tape confirmed conservatives&amp;rsquo; worst suspicions of Obama&amp;rsquo;s motives.Â Last night, I blogged on light side, asking those who support Obama whether or not they&amp;rsquo;re ready to change the US form of government.Â I tried to make the case that Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s long associations with admitted communists and terrorists, combined with expected Democrat control of both houses of Congress, placed at risk the idea of self-government, limited in its powers by a Constitution written by the People and enumerating those particular powers that we cede to the government.</description>

      <description>Among the most important titles we have in the Catholic Church for the Blessed Virgin Mary are Our Lady of Victory and Our Lady of the Rosary. These titles can be traced back to one of the most decisive times in the history of the world and Christendom. The Battle of Lepanto took place on October 7 (date of feast of Our Lady of Rosary), 1571. This proved to be the most crucial battle for the Christian forces against the radical Muslim navy of Turkey.</description>

      <description>With a little more than a week before a presidential election that could change America&amp;rsquo;s form of government, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the election as Reagan might.
I understand that many Americans are upset with the current conditions in the country. You believe that George Bush mishandled the war in Iraq, at least for a couple of years. While you&amp;rsquo;re willing to concede that the news media intentionally misled you about American successes in Iraq, you saw enough to conclude that the Administration made some mistakes&amp;ndash;and those mistakes cost lives.</description>

      <description>Black Five has the story of cowardly, pussy, scum who&amp;rsquo;s pretending to be a military hero. I know his kind of talk is frowned upon, but Charlie W. Williams should be taken out and shot. The best we can hope for in our wimpy society is for a Marine to beat the living hell out of him. The fact that he&amp;rsquo;s an old man makes no difference: you pretend to be a war hero for political purposes, you get whatever comes to you.</description>

      <description>The US launched an attack against terrorists inside Syria, killing at least eight deserving sons of bitches.
 Ninety percent of foreign fighters enter Iraq through Syria, according to U.S. intelligence estimates. Foreign fighters often enter Iraq in order to bring cash to Al Qaeda in Iraq&amp;rsquo;s chief. They also are deadly &amp;ndash; trained in bomb-making and willing to sacrifice themselves in suicide attacks.
 Syria has permitted terrorists to stage attacks against American in Iraq for five years.</description>

      <description>Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s campaign blacklisted WFTV, a Florida television station, because its anchoress, Barbara West, refused to ask Joe Biden the questions prepared and approved by the Obama campaign.
Barabara West asked Biden hard hitting questions&amp;ndash;almost as hard-hitting as questions routinely fired at GOP Vice President candidate Sarah Palin. At one point, Biden said, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know who&amp;rsquo;s writing your questions,&amp;rdquo; showing his surprised that West was making up questions rather than reading the ones written for her by the Obama campaign.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t have the heart. It&amp;rsquo;s too depressing. The news is that Obama will win in a landslide because Americans have given up on themselves. They want Obama to:
* Outlaw personal retirement savings, [seize all 401k assets](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/10/it-has-begun-dem-leaders-call-for-25.html), and create new, bigger version of Social Security** Reduce the military by [at least 25 percent](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/10/it-has-begun-dem-leaders-call-for-25.html), surrendering Afghanistan and Iraq while leaving Eastern Europe and Israel to fend for themselves** Raise taxes on everyone who&#39;s not them** Pass draconian Global Warming laws because the people are too stupid to figure out that man-made global warming is a lie  The list goes on.</description>

      <description>Say you work for a good-size, privately held company called X-Dyne Inc. X-Dyne has revenues of $2 billion a year and employs 4,000 people. Last year, X-Dyne&amp;rsquo;s EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) was $20,000. After taxes, the company made $11.1 million in profits.
The company used those profits to fund this year&amp;rsquo;s growth investments: hiring new employees, advertising and sales, research and development. Because the company&amp;rsquo;s strategy is to fund all growth with internal profits, it keeps a healthy bank account to continue operations should a large client leave the firm or should the economy turn down.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to knock off the niceties about Barack Obama and race.
Barack Obama has a college education, political office, and a name because he black and from a broken home. He happened to hit college age when it was still vogue to promote minorities through the education system, including Harvard Law, regardless of their abilities.
As a result of the misguided, dangerous attempts by guilt-ridden liberals to right a wrong they did not commit, America is on the brink of electing a mentally deficient Marxist president.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;d think his genes would have better prepared Christopher Buckley for hard times.
On Friday, the son of conservative icon William F. Buckley, endorsed Barack Obama for president. Why? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure, really, and judging by Buckley&amp;rsquo;s rambling, unfunny endorsement in The Daily Beast, neither is he.
Buckley doesn&amp;rsquo;t care for Sarah Palin, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure. He seems vaguely anti-religious, which would gravely wound his parents&amp;rsquo; hearts&amp;ndash;but they probably knew already.</description>

      <description>The world&amp;rsquo;s financial systems are succumbing to fear and negative in exponentially increasing spasms that threaten shatter to more than 200 years of economic development.
Major US corporations are now on the precipice of surrender with GM&amp;rsquo;s price plummeting and GE quietly informing SEC that it fears it will not be able to obtain cash needed to maintain operations.
The Dow Industrial Average fell more than 600 points today and has lost almost half of its value since its all-time high.</description>

What will his policies be?Â What police-state powers will the frightened, hungry, weak American people grant?
While I reserve some degree of skepticism, I am increasingly convinced there is more than coincidence behind the eery consistency between current economic problems and those predicted by Peter d.</description>

      <description>Her name is Jamie Gorelick. She was the principal architect of Al Qaeda&amp;rsquo;s ability to plan and execute the 9-11 attacks under US intel&amp;rsquo;s radar. She took $26 Million in six years from Fannie Mae by ordering accountants and internal auditors to falsify records and forge documents so ensure that she, Jim Johnson, Franklin Raines, and other Democrat executives at Fannie received maximum bonuses.

 Lehman Brothers collapse is traced back to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two big mortgage banks that got a federal bailout a few weeks ago.</description>

      <description>Somewhere between The Republican National Convention and the first debate on September 26, John McCain left the race. It&amp;rsquo;s as if the McCain campaign remains on suspension pending resolution of the economic crisis. Why?
It&amp;rsquo;s possible, of course, that McCain is simply inept at closing the deal. As every baseball fan knows, closers don&amp;rsquo;t grow on trees. Many fine pitchers flounder in the ninth inning with a narrow lead. They&amp;rsquo;re not all Bob Gibson.</description>

I headed home about 7:30. As I turned left off of Germania onto Gravois, an orange (not original color) 1974 Ford Maverick made a right off Hampton right in front of me. It took a second for my mind to make the connection.</description>

      <description>In 2004, John McCain cosponsored legislation to clean up the criminal fraud of Obama advisorFranklin Raines&amp;rsquo;s Fannie Mae. The WSJ has a round up of key Democrats defending Raines&amp;rsquo;s fraud, calling the regulators and auditors liars, and telling McCain to stuff his reforms where sun shineth not.

The more people, in my judgment, exaggerate a threat of safety and soundness, the more people conjure up the possibility of serious financial losses to the Treasury, which I do not see.</description>

      <description>so this will be my only post&amp;ndash;a series of thoughts on the day.
Financial Armageddon
In case you were too busy with your normal life and missed it, the financial armageddon promised/threatened by President Bush, Nancy Pelosi, Hank Paulson, and every other power freak on the planet failed to materialize. The Dow ended up 485 points, erasing well over half of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s losses. Before Congress does something stupid, let&amp;rsquo;s just see what happens if we, the people, are left to our own devices&amp;ndash;the way the founders planned it and the way it worked for 150 years before do-gooder morons fucked everything up.</description>

      <description>As the Wall Street crowd howls, Americans should thank the 228 Republicans and Democrats who voted against the most socialist piece of legislation offered since Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s failed attempt to nationalize medicine.
Make the Banks Fix It
I am familiar with several financial services companies.Â These outfits are demanding price concessions to help them get through the current mess.Â &amp;ldquo;Hey, we fucked up the economy&amp;ndash;why don&amp;rsquo;t you guys fix it for us?</description>

      <description>Barry &amp;ldquo;Himmler&amp;rdquo; Obama mocked John McCain for claiming that the administration&amp;rsquo;s $700 billion bailout plan lacked the votes to pass. At the White House meeting last Thursday, Obama was insulting and abusive to everyone in the room. The man who didn&amp;rsquo;t know that the inauguration is in January and not November appeared not to know that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t President.
Turns out McCain was right. Even after making progress in Washington last week and over the weekend, the bailout package still lacked a majority in the House.</description>

      <description>John McCain took an enormous risk today by suspending his campaign for President in order to do his job as a Senator, party leader, and statesman. He returned to Washington to help prevent an economic depression brought about by Obama&amp;rsquo;s financial advisors, among others.
Barack Obama ratcheted up the heat on McCain and Bush, blaming them for what his friends have done to America.
McCain is noble and honorable; Obama is a putz.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s easy, as one gets older, to feel sorry for himself. Well, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not feeling sorry for oneself as much as regretting some of the decisions we&amp;rsquo;ve made.</description>

      <description>Time magazine&amp;rsquo;s Karen Tumulty says that criticizing Franklin Raines&amp;ndash;the heart and soul of our current economic near-meltdown&amp;ndash;is racism because . . . Raines is black.
Therefore, criticizing any black is racism.
I&amp;rsquo;ve criticized and accused Franklin Raines brutally in the past two weeks, so I must be a regular David Dukes.Â Perhaps Karen Tumulty needs to change her meds.
Readers may not believe this, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize Raines was black until after I&amp;rsquo;d posted the second of my blog posts linking to Obama to Raines and Johnson and others responsible for the housing bubble and meltdown.</description>

      <description>TOP OF PAGE UPDATE
This is an eye-opener.Â I&amp;rsquo;ve simply added Years in Congress and divided total Fraudie
Mae and Fraudie Mac donations by that number to rank the top 15 recipients by $ per Year.Â Obama is winner by a ton:

As an executive at Fannie Mae, Franklin Raines illegally coerced his employees to falsify accounting facts so he&amp;rsquo;d get a maximum bonus.Â The government-backed firm used Enron-like fraud, in part at Raines&amp;rsquo;s orders, to create the largest bail-out in US history.</description>

      <description>The African-American press has decided to help Obama by threatening all-out race war in America if McCain wins. In other words, vote for Obama or die.
Last week, Fatimah Ali, a radical black writer, wrote in the Philadelphia News that if McCain wins, there will be a full-scale race war.
 If McCain wins, look for a full-fledged race and class war, fueled by a deflated and depressed country, soaring crime, homelessness - and hopelessness!</description>

ButDemocrats like to make fun of handicapped American veterans, so they jumped all over McCain&amp;rsquo;s limitations with this ad:</description>

Charlie Gibson extracted an insubordinate clause from a sentence spoken by Sarah Palin with the intent of accusing her of knowing God&amp;rsquo;s mind. Gibson did this intentionally, lied intentionally, misled intentionally. His a fraud, a cheat, and a liar.
Palin said this:
 Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right. Also, for this country, that our leaders, our national leaders, are sending [U.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a Michael Savage fan. The few times I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to his radio show, I found myself screaming at the radio, hoping he&amp;rsquo;d here me trying to educate him. My angry shaking precluded dialing the cell phone&amp;ndash;it was all I could do to keep the car on the road.
Tonight I turned on my shower radio while flossing my teeth for the first time in a week to hear Savage stumble into interesting ground.</description>

      <description>The past 24 hours will serve as the most embarrassing, self-destructive period in liberalism.Â These people (liberals) are not only stupid enough to keep Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s name in the headlines, they&amp;rsquo;re stupid enough to piss off 3/4 of the people in the country while doing it.
Ayles and Rollins couldn&amp;rsquo;t have scripted Democrat self-immolation any better.
1.Â Biden says Hillary might have been a better choice for Veep.
2.Â Carol Fowler, whose husband prayed that Gustav would destroy New Orleans, makes fun of Sarah Palin for NOT killing her babies.</description>

      <description>Obama called Sarah Palin &amp;ldquo;a pig&amp;rdquo; today.Â I guess we know, now, how he responds to pressure.
Reasonable people&amp;rsquo;s opinions of the messiah were already on the down slope, but his resorting to name-calling should pretty much assure his defeat.
He took the time to disguise the insult:Â &amp;ldquo;You can put lipstick on a pig, but it&amp;rsquo;s still a pig,&amp;rdquo; the Democrat said, referring to Palin&amp;rsquo;s famous ad lib that the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is the lipstick.</description>

A Rasmussen poll released tonight concentrates on five of those states, so let&amp;rsquo;s see how my predictions are tracking. As of Saturday, all of these states were too close to call with neither candidate holding a meaningful advantage:

Colorado: I expected the outdoors types (Rough Riders) to flock to Palin, but apparently Colorado is still under the spell of the DNC convention.</description>

Ever since Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s meteoric rise into political stardom, political junkies left and right have speculated that Team Obama could dump Joe Biden (due to some unfortunate family issue like Joe&amp;rsquo;s emerging pro-life stance) and replace him with Hillary Clinton.Â Think of it as second life for Rush Limbaugh&amp;rsquo;s Operation Chaos which extended the Democrat Nomination fight right up to mid-June.Â Let&amp;rsquo;s explore what that scenario might do to the race.</description>

      <description>Senator and VP candidate Joe Biden today broke from the DNC and from Barack Obama declaring his belief that life begins at conception, according to the New York Times.
Biden must have a very difficult time reconciling that belief with his public support of abortion rights. If he truly believes that life begins at conception, supporting abortion under and circumstances is tantamount to advocating murder.
Biden admits that he cannot fully reconcile the two opposing views:</description>

 In the new poll, taken Friday through Sunday, McCain leads Obama by 54%-44% among those seen as most likely to vote. The survey of 1,022 adults, including 959 registered voters, has a margin of error of +/â 3 points for both samples.</description>

Juan Williams, defending Barack Obama, said that Americans were sick and tired of the wealthy not paying their fair share of taxes. Juan was flat out angry.

He has earned his 15 minutes of fame by giving himself a Peyote enema and making up a ridiculous story about Sarah Palin complete with a fictitious waitress named &amp;ldquo;Lucille,&amp;rdquo; a name he probably pulled from Hunter S. Thompson&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.&amp;rdquo; (I don&amp;rsquo;t have the book in front of me, but I believe that Lucille was the name of the maid that Duke&amp;rsquo;s attorney attacked in the hotel room when the attorney mistook the maid&amp;rsquo;s mop for an axe handle.</description>

      <description>Two polls&amp;ndash;Zogby and Gallup&amp;ndash;now have John McCain and Sarah Palin leading Barack Obama and Joe Biden by 4 and 3 percentage points, respectively. Both leads are beyond the margins of error.
Clearly, the voters like what they see in McCain and, especially, Palin. These results also validate the idea that Democrat lies and smears aimed at Palin are actually helping the GOP ticket.
As a result of these numbers, Barack Obama has abandoned the traditional, academic definition of recession, and breaking another promise to his far left supporters: he will extend the Bush tax cuts in order to help the economy.</description>

      <description>The messiah today told ABC News that he considered joining the military, only there weren&amp;rsquo;t any big wars going on at the time.Â  But keep in mind â I graduated in 1979. The Vietnam War had come to an end. We weren&amp;rsquo;t engaged in an active military conflict at that point. And so, it&amp;rsquo;s not an option that I ever decided to pursue.
 I guess we&amp;rsquo;re all stupid enough to believe that had Vietnam dragged on a bit longer, Obama would have marched his scrawny ass down to the nearest Marine Corps recruiter and signed up for infantry.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard John McCain&amp;rsquo;s horrible experience in Vietnam.Â I&amp;rsquo;ve never before heard him tell it.
What strikes me is the enormous contrast between him and Barack Obama.Â John McCain has lived a noble, heroic, remarkable life.Â Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s read about such things.
John McCain left it all on the battle field, then in a POW camp, then in hospitals where he gave his all for his country.Â Barack Obama took everything he could get his hands on:Â money from a convicted slum-lord felon, street cred from bigotted America-hating minister, political favor from a convicted anti-American terrorist.</description>

Quinn, who said a woman with 5 children has no business holding an important job, is, herself, a working mother. Perhaps Quinn is a slacker, though.</description>

 They say I lack experience.Â They&amp;rsquo;re right, in a way.
 I have no experience wandering a city for three years trying to find myself.Â No, I&amp;rsquo;ve never had that luxury.Â But Barack Obama has.
And I have no experience funneling money from an educational trust into organizations run by my close friend, the convicted terrorist.Â No experience at all.
Nor do I have the experience of having a political career launched by a pair of terrorists who tried to blow up the Capitol and the Pentagon, who succeeded in killing a police officer.</description>

      <description>Not my words, there, but those of Susan Estrich, Democrat feminist, speaking on FoxNews. Estrich specifically identified the hateful sexists as &amp;ldquo;my friends.&amp;rdquo; She thoroughly and unquestionably denounced everything that&amp;rsquo;s come from Washington Post, New York Times, US magazine, and Barney Frank

Earlier, Laura Ingraham nailed it, saying, &amp;ldquo;If this were a liberal, feminist, pro-choice woman candidate whose daughter got pregnant and had an abortion during the campaign, she&amp;rsquo;d be hailed as a hero.</description>

      <description>Is anyone dumber than Barack Obama?
I&amp;rsquo;ve interviewed a lot of job candidates, usually for positions as computer programmers, network engineers, and project manager. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a lot of bullshit in these interviews. I usually let these poor, desperate folks make their case. I shake their hands, escort them out, thank them for considering my company, call them about 2 hours later, and tell them, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m selecting another candidate for the position, and I wish you all the best in your pursuit.</description>

      <description>Fred Thompson validated all of my reasons for being a conservative and a Republican. Joe Lieberman vindicated my decision to support John McCain. The combination of speakers and videos restored in Republicans that swagger we had when Reagan handed over the reins to George H. W. Bush.
After two days of disgraceful, amoral, hate, innuendo, and cynicism from the leftist media in this country, the parade of grown-ups must have struck every viewer as the nation&amp;rsquo;s passage from infancy to a particularly profound adulthood.</description>

      <description>Michelle Malkin calls is &amp;ldquo;Palin Derangement Syndrome.&amp;rdquo;Â William F. Buckley called it &amp;ldquo;liberal mania.&amp;rdquo;Â I call it &amp;ldquo;angry cynicism.&amp;rdquo;Â Call it what you will, the leftist media&amp;rsquo;s treatment of Sarah Palin and her family is an embarrassment to the country and felony indictment of the journalism industry in America.
Only Hurricane Gustav&amp;rsquo;s untimely arrival spared us from 24 hours of Bristol Palin&amp;rsquo;s sex life on CNN.Â Every political/talk host on the network devoted the majority of his show to the subject.</description>

      <description>Despite promises from Barack Obama that his campaign would drop attacks on its Republican rivals during Hurricane Gustav, that walking hunk of excrement, Joe Biden, broke the promise and ripped into John McCain today during a stump speech.
 The only guy in America in a position of some authority who is out of sync with the whole rest of the world is John McCain.
 Earlier in the day, Biden skipped out on a planned appearance at Labor Day parade in Pittsburgh, Pa.</description>

      <description>Asked about Bristol Palin&amp;rsquo;s pregnancy, Barack Obama firmly stated that children of candidates are &amp;ldquo;off limits,&amp;rdquo; and that anyone in his campaign discussing the matter &amp;ldquo;will be fired.&amp;rdquo;
Outstanding. I watched and heard the interview, and I have no doubt he meant what he said. His vigor was sincere.
As someone who villifies Obama regularly, I owe it to the man when he comes through. This time he did.
I hope his minions listen.</description>

      <description>Un-fucking-believable.Â Wolff Blitzer has no shame.Â His show is devoting the 5:00 p.m. hour to continuing the idiotic rumor that Sarah Palin faked her fifth pregnancy to cover the actual pregnancy of her daughter.
They also spent 10 minutes spinning innuendo over the troopergate fabrication.Â CNN&amp;rsquo;s justification is that Palin hired a lawyer to handle the investigation.Â Duh!Â What was she supposed to do, hire a veterinarian?Â Her political enemies, of which she has many due to her cleaning-up of the GOP in Alaska, have seized upon a family dispute between Palin&amp;rsquo;s sister and brother-in-law, a State Trooper in Alaska.</description>

      <description>Not an exaggeration.Â Gateway Pundit was an intended target as leftist protestors hurled sacks of rocks and cement on speeding busses of GOP delegates, media, and participants.Â The leftards stood on overpasses above an interstate highway and dropped the sacks on passing busses.
A few years back in St. Louis, a woman&amp;ndash;recent emigrant from Russia&amp;ndash;was killed by a rock dropped from an overpass over I-64 as she returned home from work late one evening.</description>

Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s eldest daughter, Bristol, is pregnant and will marry Levi, the child&amp;rsquo;s father, Todd and Sarah said today in a press release [FoxNews.com].
 The 17-year-old unwed daughter of John McCainâs new running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, is five-months pregnant, Palin and her husband, Todd Palin, said Monday in a written statement.
 McCainâs campaign told FOX News that the presumptive Republican presidential candidate knew about Bristol Palinâs pregnancy before he chose Palin as his running mate last Friday, and that Bristol is planning to marry the father of her child.</description>

      <description>Every mention of Sarah Palin produced a banner-waving roar from the crowd of over 20,000 in T. R. Hughes Stadium in O&amp;rsquo;Fallon, Missouri, on blistering hot Sunday afternoon.Â While McCain is on top of the ticket, Palin is the draw.
A woman from Dent County&amp;ndash;about 3 hours from O&amp;rsquo;Fallon&amp;ndash;made the drive to see McCain and Palin in person.Â She was thrilled to get hold of a &amp;ldquo;McCain-Palin&amp;rdquo; banner after several stacks of the banners didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to her.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re getting ready to head out to the McCain Rally in O&amp;rsquo;Fallon, Missouri.Â I just checked with the campaign and the rally is still on.Â John McCain is stopping in New Orleans to check on hurricane preparations before the rally, so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if it starts late.
I&amp;rsquo;ll have photos and a report on the events this evening.

      <description>On Thursday, the Washington Post gleefully reported that the GOP couldn&amp;rsquo;t give away tickets to McCain&amp;rsquo;s scheduled pre-convention rallies in Dayton, Ohio, Pittsburgh, PA, and O&amp;rsquo;Fallon, MO.
That ended with the announcement of Palin as is VP choice.
In St. Louis, tickets disappeared so quickly (and the distribution method was so lame-brained) that even donors and party activists with guaranteed reservations lost their reservations. The party decided to give away reserved tickets to meet the clamorous demand at the doors of various ticket locations (which is going to royally piss off my son Patrick when he finds out they gave away our tickets).</description>

Sarah Palin may not be the perfect pick for VP, but she&amp;rsquo;s the most perfect available. By selecting a (hot) working class mother of five with strong conservative principles and a record of putting the people before parties and pricnipalities, John McCain has proven, again, to be the most effective Republican campaigner since Reagan.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s surprising, really, that Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s entire speech is an attack on John McCain filled with lies, deceits, and fake &amp;ldquo;facts.&amp;rdquo;
His self-aggrandizementÂ borders on pathological. He alone will defend Israel. He alone will stop 4 billion years of climate change. He alone will provide health insurance to every man, woman, and child. The economy never had a negative growth quarter, but he sees a recession. Perhaps that recession comes from the emptiness of rhetoric.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s what we know about Obama vis-a-vis the job of Commander in Chief: * No military experience * No business experience * Best friends are terrorists and racists * Believes in socialism over capitalism * Meglomaniacal fascination with himself * Wife hates America, except when America gives her cash * Funnels money to radicals in exchange for political favors * Made over $4 million last year and claims to hate the rich * Want&amp;rsquo;s to double the average American family&amp;rsquo;s tax burden * Hires mafia thugs to intimidate Republican rivals * Smokes and tells us not to * He&amp;rsquo;s not particularly smart, but he pretends to be in speeches * Lies about his political past, his personal past, his intentions * Lacks the spine to stand up for what he actually believes in So what&amp;rsquo;s that one word?</description>

DENVER&amp;ndash;Police in Denver arrested an ABC News producer today as he and a camera crew were attempting to take pictures on a public sidewalk of Democratic Senators and VIP donors leaving a private meeting at the Brown Palace Hotel.

      <description>According to Stanley Kurtz, one of a handful of reports allowed to see the Ayers Papers at University of Illinois, Chicago, &amp;ldquo;Our worst fears were confirmed.&amp;rdquo; Radical terrorist William Ayers, founder of the Weathermen and theÂ Woods Fund of Chicago, appointed Obama as one of three directors of the &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo; project in 1995. In exchange for the appointment and the right use it as street cred in his first political campaign, Obama voted to siphon funds intended for public school education programs into Ayers&amp;rsquo;s radical political organizations.</description>

This guy is as red as Stalin. Don&amp;rsquo;t think for a moment that, if Obama wins, the RNC&amp;rsquo;s donor list will be scrutinized and big donors prosecuted.

      <description>I listened to Hillary&amp;rsquo;s speech at the DNC in my car driving home from Strategic Planning class. First, I was struck by what a terrible speaker she is. Without the art and artifice of the convention hall, choreographed cameras, and wide shots of adoring fans, speakers are left with only their tone, pitch, inflection, volume, thoughts, ideas, and syntax to carry the message. Hillary Clinton lacked them all.
Her speech seemed short.</description>

      <description>The University of Illinois releases the Obama-Ayers papers tomorrow. Don&amp;rsquo;t expect the MSM to mention it&amp;ndash;unless it&amp;rsquo;s good news for Obama.
Meanwhile, Obama has asked the Department of Justice to block ads that link the Illinois Senator to domestic terrorist William Ayers. Pathetic.
 Obamaâs campaign has written the Department of Justice demanding a criminal investigation of the âAmerican Issues Project,â the vehicle through which Dallas investor Harold Simmons is financing the advertisements.</description>

 Supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton are furiously circulating petitions on the floor of the Democratic National Convention tonight, hoping to stave off a plan to hold the convention&amp;rsquo;s roll call at breakfast Wednesday â out of the public eye â sources inside the delegations say.</description>

      <description>A fe months ago, only conservatives and Republicans were talking about Obama&amp;rsquo;s arrogance.Â Now, everyone&amp;rsquo;s noticing it.
 Something about Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s manner bothers Margaret Cowan.
 &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s something egotistical about him,&amp;rdquo; the Sheridan, Colo., retiree said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the way he struts around.&amp;rdquo;
Many swing voters here and throughout the country consider the presumptive Democratic nominee distant, pompous, arrogant, even elitist. [Kansas City Star]
Democrat consultants say Obama&amp;rsquo;s arrogance is a real issue that needs to be addressed.</description>

The McCain campaign&amp;rsquo;s marketing brilliance continues to amaze. I had no idea he would be this adept at modern campaigning. With this ad, McCain will foment the still-simmering anger among Clinton&amp;rsquo;s most loyal supporters, as demonstrated in this Washington Times article.</description>

ABC News&amp;rsquo;s Jake Tapper spent his Saturday morning documenting some of Joe Biden&amp;rsquo;s dumbest moments. (It&amp;rsquo;s long.)Â My favorite came from a Biden 1988 campaign ad in which he seemed to anticipate Obama&amp;rsquo;s candidacy:
 &amp;ldquo;The White House isn&amp;rsquo;t the place to learn how to deal with international crisis, the balance of power, war and peace, and the economic future of the next generation,&amp;rdquo; said a TV ad for Sen.</description>

Because Biden was the party&amp;rsquo;s choice, not Obama&amp;rsquo;s.
Obama wanted a young candidate, a liberal, who would make Obama look stronger, older, weightier.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know how meaningful this FoxNews poll is, really. But it is revealing about America&amp;rsquo;s confidence in the relative judgment of McCain and Obama.
American&amp;rsquo;s trust McCain more than 3 to 1 over Obama.
That&amp;rsquo;s big.
 If you had to make the âtoughest decisionâ of your life, who would you rather get advice from â Obama or McCain?
 Based on that question, there are signs that undecided voters may be more inclined to move to McCain than to Obama.</description>

Everybodyâs watching whatâs going on in Beijing right now with the Olympics. Think about the amount of money that China has spent on infrastructure. Their ports, their train systems, their airports are vastly the superior to us now, which means if you are a corporation deciding where to do business youâre starting to think, âBeijing looks like a pretty good option.</description>

They were wrong.Â So was I.
Somehow, McCain staged a masterful comeback, and I use the word &amp;ldquo;masterful&amp;rdquo; advisedly.Â His comeback was not spectacular or flamboyant or even memorable.Â It was quiet, consistent, and strong.</description>

      <description>Rush Limbaugh came close, today, to a telling insight into the left&amp;rsquo;s love of Obama. He finished short. Let me complete Rush&amp;rsquo;s thought: The left worship Obama hoping for absolution and salvation.
Absolution is a big thing to a Catholic. It&amp;rsquo;s the difference between Heaven and Hell. Absolution comes only from God through His son Jesus Christ&amp;rsquo;s death and resurrection. The Messiah paved the way.
The left&amp;rsquo;s deification of Obama stands on its own.</description>

      <description>Maybe I didn&amp;rsquo;t overreact last week.Â According to the Washington Post on the scene in Gori, Republic of Georgia, Soviet Russian troops are &amp;ldquo;digging&amp;rdquo; for a long offensive or occupation:
 Russia pledged Sunday to begin removing its troops from Georgia on Monday, but the streets of this occupied city reflected a broadening, not a waning, of Russia&amp;rsquo;s military incursion.
 . . .
During a reporter&amp;rsquo;s 24-hour stay in the city this weekend, Russian soldiers roamed the streets in armored personnel carriers and waved Kalashnikov rifles to prevent entry to a captured Georgian military base that is now the Russian headquarters.</description>

      <description>The day after John McCain handed Barack Obama his ass on a platter at the Saddleback Forum, Obama&amp;rsquo;s paid mouthpiece, Andrea Mitchell, accused McCain of cheating (see Newsbusters).Â I guess going mano-a-mano with a real man is above Obama&amp;rsquo;s paygrade, too.
How pathetically consistent.Â Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s childishness, immaturity, and lack of accountability grow to new legendary heights every passing day.Â I really don&amp;rsquo;t know how people can take this brat seriously.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve had a week to look at our two presidential candidates&amp;rsquo; handling of the largest foreign policy incident so far this campaign.Â In this crisis, we saw theÂ difference between a strong man and an insecure boy.
John McCain, who warned us a long time ago that President Bush&amp;rsquo;s evaluation of Putin was naive, called the matter right from the start, according Jim Wooten in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Â McCain, who once said that he looked into Putin&amp;rsquo;s eyes and saw &amp;ldquo;a &amp;lsquo;K&amp;rsquo;, a &amp;lsquo;G&amp;rsquo;, and a &amp;lsquo;B&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rdquo;Â held one, single, defining position throughout the crisis:</description>

      <description>8/28/08 8:50 p.m. CDT:Â NOT GUILTY! UPDATE:Â Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to a defense fund for Sgt. Nazario and his brothers who have been coerced into testifying against him by the rogue Federal Persecutor, Jerry Behnke. I&amp;rsquo;ve made my donation; please make yours today. Federal prosecutors, emboldened by leftist anti-military groups, will persecute a former Marine for alleged murder committed while he was on active duty in Iraq.
 A former Marine sergeant facing the first federal civilian prosecution of a military member accused of a war crime says there is much more at stake than his claim of innocence on charges that he killed unarmed detainees in Fallujah, Iraq.</description>

      <description>To say Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s intellectual stamina is weak is like saying Georgia&amp;rsquo;s a bad vacation destination right now.Â (Georgia the republic, not the state.)
Under the brilliant title &amp;ldquo;Obama&amp;rsquo;s Paygrade = E-0&amp;rdquo; comes this:
 Last night the Obama was asked when an unborn child got legal rights. Like the spineless political tool he is he refused to answer stating that it was above his pay grade. The reason his answer matters is that he supports abortion on demand even when a child accidentally survives and lives outside the womb.</description>

      <description>Everytime I&amp;rsquo;ve debated the death penalty with a bleeding-heart, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this question:Â &amp;ldquo;Would you pull the switch&amp;rdquo; or its equal.Â It&amp;rsquo;s only fair to turn the question on them.
Barack Obama, if you read this blog, please answer this question:Â Would you kill child who survived an abortion with your own hands?Â (Thanks to Jill Stanek viaÂ Michelle Malkin)
 Barack Obama, as chairman of an IL state Senate committee, voted down a bill to protect live-born survivors of abortion - even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language, copied from a federal bill passed by Congress without objection in 2002, explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion.</description>

      <description>Steve McIntyre tears to shreds an anti-speech ruling by the British equivalent of the FCC, Ofcom.Â Ofcom ruled that a documentary &amp;ldquo;The Great Global Warming Swindle&amp;rdquo; violated rules, essentially, because the producers presented evidence contrary to the party line of the United Nations and the Labor government. In other words, in the UK, thou shalt not question global warming.

      <description>While my flaming headline (&amp;quot;Dr. James Hansen of GISS is a Liar and Fraud&amp;quot;) received a fair amount of attention, people a lot smarter than I are carefully documenting the facts that led to my unavoidable conclusion.
One such appears on the Telegraph today.Â Christopher Booker (corrected link) notes that Dr. Hansen&amp;rsquo;s GISS center is alone in seeing continued warming throughout the world.Â Pointing out that laws supported by Hansen, Al Gore, and others will cost tens of trillions of dollars and severely limit freedoms throughout the world for the generations, Booker rightly contends that those proposing such a retreat from liberty be damn well sure they&amp;rsquo;re right.</description>

 U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said in an interview published on Saturday the size of a residual U.</description>

      <description>TigerHawk decided to fact-check Obama&amp;rsquo;s pontifical address to his German subjects concerning the messiah&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;facts&amp;rdquo; about global warming (h/t Hackbarth).Â Like Hansen and Gore, Obama enjoys lying to the people.Â TigerHawk shows academic research that report sea levels falling, not rising, and Kansas not in a drought, but normal to exceptionally moist.
I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised to catch Obama in a lie; I am surprised that people continue to lie about global warming despite all scientific evidence (not doctored byJames Hansen) to the contrary.</description>

      <description>Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s most conspicuous quality, if you want to call it that, is shameless arrogance. His trip abroad was like Hitler&amp;rsquo;s tour of Italy in 1938.Â Before you dismiss my view as that of a party hack tearing down the opposition, read Susan Estrich&amp;rsquo;s column on FoxNews.com. (Estrich was Michael Dukakis&amp;rsquo;s campaign manager in 1988).
First, Presidential candidates rarely campaign in war zones, and for good reason.Â American politics traditionally sort of stopped &amp;ldquo;at the water&amp;rsquo;s edge,&amp;rdquo; as the saying went.</description>

In an article titled, &amp;ldquo;James Hansen:Â Abusing the Public Trust,&amp;rdquo; Sussman writes:
 Topping it all, Hansen has allegedly received hundreds of thousands of additional dollars to further politicize the issue of global warming.Â According to Investors Business Daily, &amp;ldquo;How many people, for instance, know that James Hansen, a man billed as a lonely âNASA whistleblower&amp;rsquo; standing up to the mighty U.S. government, was really funded by [George] Soros&amp;rsquo; Open Society Institute (OSI), which gave him âlegal and media advice&amp;rsquo;?</description>

      <description>On Friday, the New York Times refused to publish an op-ed piece by Republican nominee John McCain (FoxNews.com).Â This might be the first time in American history that a newspaper turned down a column by a presidential candidate from a major party.Â According to Jonathan Martin of Politico, the Times demanded that McCain include &amp;ldquo;timetables&amp;rdquo; for withdrawal if he wants NYT inches.Â This also demonstrates why liberalism is incompatible with democracy.</description>

      <description>Rasmussen&amp;rsquo;s presidential tracking poll shows a dead heat between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican Presidential Candidate John McCain (h/t Drudge).Â This poll confirms the Newsweek poll showing the two in a statistical dead heat.
Moreover, according Rasmussen, McCain enjoys higher favorability ratings than Obama.
Considering that McCain has received little media attention since the last Democrat primary in June, Obama&amp;rsquo;s 15 percentage point drop can only be blamed on Obama&amp;rsquo;s dismal performance as a candidate.</description>

      <description>Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s poll lead over John McCain has plummeted from 51-35 to a statistical dead-heat in less than a month.
Obama&amp;rsquo;s downward spiral has Newsweek&amp;rsquo;s headline writers asking if his glow is fading. The polls finds that more than half of voters consider Obama lying opportunist who will take any position for votes.
 Obama&amp;rsquo;s rapid drop comes at a strategically challenging moment for the Democratic candidate. Having vanquished Hillary Clinton in early June, Obama quickly went about repositioning himself for a general-election audience&amp;ndash;an unpleasant task for any nominee emerging from the pander-heavy primary contests and particularly for a candidate who&amp;rsquo;d slogged through a vigorous primary challenge in most every contest from January until June.</description>

It struck me that the pundits&amp;ndash;liberal Democrats all&amp;ndash;seemed to have forgotten that another vote happens in November.

Principle findings:
* Gun owners are happier than non-owners (Barack&#39;s prejudice debunked)** Gun owners earn more than non-owners (Barack&#39;s preju** dice debunked)** Gun owners are equally educated with non-owners (Barack&#39;s prejudice debunked)  Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;bittergate&amp;rdquo; comments served to debunk the Barack myth.

      <description>Every modern man knows that invalidating a woman&amp;rsquo;s feelings lies on the offensiveness scale somewhere between unwelcomed groping and fat jokes. Whether or not it&amp;rsquo;s fair to suffer a woman&amp;rsquo;s wrath because she misunderstood a word is another matter.
Last week, Barack Obama smugly told a group of billionaire liberals in San Francisco that rural Americans are bitter, ignorant Neanderthals who prefer guns and superstitions (aka, religion) and race-hatred to reason, education, and hard work.</description>

 So it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising then that they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren&amp;rsquo;t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.

I read the lengthy New York Times story about Obama&amp;rsquo;s uselessness in the US Senate yesterday. I was too confused to write.

      <description>If John McCain (or Huckster) is the Republican nominee, why would anyone, other than GOP loyalists, vote Republican?
To paraphrase Harry Truman, if McCain (or Huckster) is the nominee, there won&amp;rsquo;t be a dime&amp;rsquo;s difference between the two parties. Given that, why not vote for the real deal in Hillary or Obama? McCain is an impostor.Â (Related:Â Michelle Malkin asks ifÂ the GOP is lost.)
Ronald Reagan won because he was sooooooo different from the Democrats that conservative Democrats and independents exercised the freedom of political choice and crossed over to our side.</description>

      <description>The next election loomed ominously upon the political horizon in November 1979. A decade of failed foreign policy, Soviet expansion, stagflation, gas and oil shortages, historically severe winters, soaring crime rates, marauding youth, sexual perversion, and unstable standards left the American people wondering, &amp;ldquo;What next?&amp;rdquo;
Next, of course, was the Iranian hostage crisis, which might well be called &amp;ldquo;the last straw.&amp;rdquo; Jimmy Carter and his Democrat party took the blame. The once proud term &amp;ldquo;liberalism&amp;rdquo; became profane.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ll be hearing that mantra from the left pretty soon because poverty rates are lower under Bush than they were under Clinton.Â That means the Republicans can look into the camera next fall and ask Americans, &amp;ldquo;Are you better off now than you were eight years ago.&amp;rdquo;Â For those at the bottom of the econmic ladder, the answer must be, &amp;ldquo;Yes!&amp;rdquo;
Leftist economists still claim that supply side economics and stimulation through tax cutsÂ are fantasies.</description>

      <description>Too much of a good thing, as my mother would say, turns bad.
When Chesterton wrote &amp;ldquo;Orthodoxy&amp;rdquo; in 1908, he looked at his modern times and pitied their unimaginative banality. He would surely weep aloud were he to observe our times.
&amp;ldquo;The modern world,&amp;rdquo; he wrote a century ago, &amp;ldquo;is full of the old Christian virtues gone mad. The virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone.</description>
