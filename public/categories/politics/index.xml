      <description>The morons in the White House press corps spend most of today&amp;rsquo;s briefing screaming at press secretary Kayleigh McEnany about President Trump&amp;rsquo;s order to re-open all churches.
The oft-repeated (shouted) question: &amp;ldquo;What federal law is the president relying on to require states to allow church services?&amp;rdquo;
The question demonstrates the absolute ignorance and laziness, the besst-like stupidity, of most journalists.
  The president&amp;rsquo;s authority is the United States Constitution, you mouth-breathing swine!</description>

      <description>St. Louis, Missouri, consistently makes everyone&amp;rsquo;s top 10 lists for worst cities in the United States. The reasons given include crime, lack of opportunity, and dilapidated neighborhoods. Having grown up in the city, and with most of my family still living there, I can add to that list unreliable city services, terrible roads, cronyism, and less than ideal weather.

      <description>Sadly, very sincere people, almost in tears, ask our forgiveness for wearing masks.
&amp;ldquo;I wear a mask so I don&amp;rsquo;t unknowingly pass a disease to someone else,&amp;rdquo; one such explained to me on Twitter.
These are not bad people. In fact, they think themselves very, very good people, indeed. The best. The ones willing to wear masks so as not to spread their (remotely possible) contagion to others.

      <description>Releasing national security intercepts to unauthorized persons is a federal felony punishable by 10 years in prison. And at least one of the names on this list of top Obama Administration officials is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 18 U.S. Code § 798(a)(4):
 Whoever knowingly and willfully communicates, furnishes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to an unauthorized person, or publishes, or uses in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interest of the United States or for the benefit of any foreign government to the detriment of the United States any classified information—obtained by the processes of communication intelligence from the communications of any foreign government, knowing the same to have been obtained by such processes—Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.</description>

      <description>WASHINGTON — Members of the so-called &amp;ldquo;Obama Alumni Association&amp;rdquo; feel harassed and abused by the former president whose late-night, drunken conference calls have become annoying, frequent, and less coherent as time goes on.
Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View has learned that Obama began these occasional conference calls with a handful of former officials about six months after leaving office in 2017. Over time, the 44th president stopped following a semi-weekly schedule of planned calls.</description>
