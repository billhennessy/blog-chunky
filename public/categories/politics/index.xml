      <title>Democrats Turn Nursing Homes Into Death Camps</title>

      <description>When I wrote this post on May 6, I worried how it would be received. Accusing a governor of intentionally killing nursing home residents in order to save money is a serious charge. And, with only circumstantial evidence, difficult to prove.
Since then, Andrew Cuomo&amp;rsquo;s behavior has been consistent with guilt. The latest example is deflection. He&amp;rsquo;s trying, now, to blame federal guidelines for his order to force uninfected nursing homes to treat confirmed COVID-19 patients even if they lacked the facilities and skills to do so.</description>

      <description>Via WGEM:
 Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker responded Friday afternoon to President Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s statement earlier in the day where Trump said he had deemed churches and other houses of worship &amp;ldquo;essential&amp;rdquo; and called on governors to allow them to reopen this weekend.
During his COVID-19 press briefing on Friday afternoon, Gov. Pritzker said Illinois would continue to operate on the basis of science and data.
 If JB Pritzker, governor of Illinois, took science and data seriously, he&amp;rsquo;d drop about 280 pounds fast.</description>

      <description>The morons in the White House press corps spend most of today&amp;rsquo;s briefing screaming at press secretary Kayleigh McEnany about President Trump&amp;rsquo;s order to re-open all churches.
The oft-repeated (shouted) question: &amp;ldquo;What federal law is the president relying on to require states to allow church services?&amp;rdquo;
The question demonstrates the absolute ignorance and laziness, the besst-like stupidity, of most journalists.
  The president&amp;rsquo;s authority is the United States Constitution, you mouth-breathing swine!</description>

      <description>St. Louis, Missouri, consistently makes everyone&amp;rsquo;s top 10 lists for worst cities in the United States. The reasons given include crime, lack of opportunity, and dilapidated neighborhoods. Having grown up in the city, and with most of my family still living there, I can add to that list unreliable city services, terrible roads, cronyism, and less than ideal weather.

      <title>Masks Are Not to Control a Virus—Masks Are to Control YOU</title>

      <description>Sadly, very sincere people, almost in tears, ask our forgiveness for wearing masks.
&amp;ldquo;I wear a mask so I don&amp;rsquo;t unknowingly pass a disease to someone else,&amp;rdquo; one such explained to me on Twitter.
These are not bad people. In fact, they think themselves very, very good people, indeed. The best. The ones willing to wear masks so as not to spread their (remotely possible) contagion to others.
