      <description>Sadly, very sincere people, almost in tears, ask our forgiveness for wearing masks.
&amp;ldquo;I wear a mask so I don&amp;rsquo;t unknowingly pass a disease to someone else,&amp;rdquo; one such explained to me on Twitter.
These are not bad people. In fact, they think themselves very, very good people, indeed. The best. The ones willing to wear masks so as not to spread their (remotely possible) contagion to others.

      <description>Releasing national security intercepts to unauthorized persons is a federal felony punishable by 10 years in prison. And at least one of the names on this list of top Obama Administration officials is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 18 U.S. Code § 798(a)(4):
 Whoever knowingly and willfully communicates, furnishes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to an unauthorized person, or publishes, or uses in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interest of the United States or for the benefit of any foreign government to the detriment of the United States any classified information—obtained by the processes of communication intelligence from the communications of any foreign government, knowing the same to have been obtained by such processes—Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.</description>

      <description>WASHINGTON — Members of the so-called &amp;ldquo;Obama Alumni Association&amp;rdquo; feel harassed and abused by the former president whose late-night, drunken conference calls have become annoying, frequent, and less coherent as time goes on.
Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View has learned that Obama began these occasional conference calls with a handful of former officials about six months after leaving office in 2017. Over time, the 44th president stopped following a semi-weekly schedule of planned calls.</description>

      <description>One of the most despicable men alive, ABC News White House reporter Jon Karl, took his shot a Pulitzer for online journalism today by snitching on Fox News&amp;rsquo; John Roberts.
Roberts, aparently, was the last person outdoors in the Rose Garden, to put on his mask.
Look a &amp;ldquo;Karen&amp;rdquo; Karl&amp;rsquo;s snotty tweet:
Almost everybody in the Rose Garden is wearing a mask — almost everybody. pic.twitter.com/JBnEV05HOd

      <description>Everybody&amp;rsquo;s talking about the fourth stimulus bill. Infrastructure. Payroll tax cut. Vote by mail.
But there won&amp;rsquo;t be one.
There will be a stimulus, but it will not come from Congress. The fourth stimulus will come from you and me.
There are three reasons for this, which I will get to in a moment. But, first, do me a favor: Please share this post with your members of Congress. It&amp;rsquo;s that important.</description>
