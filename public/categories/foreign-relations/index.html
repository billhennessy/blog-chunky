Almost simultaneous with North Korea&amp;rsquo;s launching an ICBM in violation of international law and in defiance of US warnings, Barack Obama stood before the world and declared his intention to disarm the arsenal for democracy.

                The new Secretary of Homeland Security has replaced the word &amp;ldquo;terrorism&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;man-caused disasters.&amp;rdquo;
 I did not use the word &amp;ldquo;terrorism,&amp;rdquo; I referred to &amp;ldquo;man-caused&amp;rdquo; disasters. That is perhaps only a nuance, but it demonstrates that we want to move away from the politics of fear toward a policy of being prepared for all risks that can occur.
 I assume that appointing an idiot like Napolitano to the cabinet qualifies as a man-cause disaster.

                Israel&amp;rsquo;s assault on Hamas terrorists in Gaza continued for a second day. As if reading from a script, the UN Security Council called for an immediate stop to Israel&amp;rsquo;s self-defense. As the air strikes continued, Israel has moved more troops and tanks to the border, possibly in preparation for an incursion into the area now under terrorist control.
Some internation responses were less than predictable, though. France, for instance, demands first that the terrorists stop pitching rockets at Israeli school kids, then that Israel stop its air assault.

The Arab world (yawn) reacted predictably, condemning Israel (yawn) and staging street protests (yawn). I&amp;rsquo;m sure many a rifle was fired into the air.
The left&amp;ndash;and I suspect Barack Obama is included&amp;ndash;will decry Israel&amp;rsquo;s self-defense. They will call for Israel to show restraint. They will call on Israel to take another body blow.

                Barack Obama has a lot of friends who would like to see a Final Solution to the Middle East, if you get my drift. Samantha Power, for instance, told the Institute for Policy Studies (which was founded by the KGB during the Cold War) that the US should invade Israel and set up a puppet government to impose a suicidal deal with Hamas. Nice, huh?
Add to that a mounting certainty that Iran will deploy a nuclear weapon by the end of 2009&amp;ndash;a year Obama must devote almost solely to the economy.

                Is Mumbai a test run for an attack on the United States?
 Al Qaeda is out of practice. The terror organization has been quite since 2001, pinned down inside in Iraq where our heroes destroyed their efforts to establish a beach head.
The coincidence of the horror in Mumbai with the FBI reports of a serious, legitimate threat to the NYC subway system seems coordinated to me.
Since 9-11, the US, UK, and Israel have trained and developed anti-terrorism techniques jointly with many nations, including India.

September 11 and the liberation of Iraq came with live blogging from people feet from the action.

 Ninety percent of foreign fighters enter Iraq through Syria, according to U.S. intelligence estimates. Foreign fighters often enter Iraq in order to bring cash to Al Qaeda in Iraq&amp;rsquo;s chief. They also are deadly &amp;ndash; trained in bomb-making and willing to sacrifice themselves in suicide attacks.
 Syria has permitted terrorists to stage attacks against American in Iraq for five years.

                Maybe I didn&amp;rsquo;t overreact last week. According to the Washington Post on the scene in Gori, Republic of Georgia, Soviet Russian troops are &amp;ldquo;digging&amp;rdquo; for a long offensive or occupation:
 Russia pledged Sunday to begin removing its troops from Georgia on Monday, but the streets of this occupied city reflected a broadening, not a waning, of Russia&amp;rsquo;s military incursion.
 . . .
During a reporter&amp;rsquo;s 24-hour stay in the city this weekend, Russian soldiers roamed the streets in armored personnel carriers and waved Kalashnikov rifles to prevent entry to a captured Georgian military base that is now the Russian headquarters.

John McCain, who warned us a long time ago that President Bush&amp;rsquo;s evaluation of Putin was naive, called the matter right from the start, according Jim Wooten in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. McCain, who once said that he looked into Putin&amp;rsquo;s eyes and saw &amp;ldquo;a &amp;lsquo;K&amp;rsquo;, a &amp;lsquo;G&amp;rsquo;, and a &amp;lsquo;B&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rdquo; held one, single, defining position throughout the crisis:

                Mike Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s recent ascent through the polls is about to reverse itself. Looking through RealClearPolitics news stories and polls, I saw a pattern:
 * Huckabee says something stupid * Romney fires off attack ads on Huckabee * Huckabee makes something up that might not be true * Romney fires off attack ads on Huckabee * Huckabee attacks Romney&#39;s ads * Repeat until sick  Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that people in Iowa, New Hampshire, Michigan, and the Palmetto State are not sadists who pick a candidate based primarily upon his or her ability to insult and impugn opponents.

                From CNN:
 A senior aide to Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee admitted Friday that the former Arkansas governor had &amp;ldquo;no foreign policy credentials&amp;rdquo; after his comments reacting to the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto raised questions.
 When a candidate&amp;rsquo;s senior aide admits the candidate knows nothing about the world beyond Arkansas, USA, the voters must take the aide seriously. A vote for Huckabee might be more un-American than a vote for a Democrat.

                The two leading Democrat contenders for president took time out from their campaigns, yesterday, using Benazir Bhutto&amp;rsquo;s assassination to demonstrate their utter incapability and unpreparedness to lead the world&amp;rsquo;s last remaining superpower.
Obama
Barrack Obama&amp;rsquo;s team blamed the United States, George Bush, and everyone who supported the Iraq War for Bhutto&amp;rsquo;s assassination. In other words, like the child he is, Obama blamed everyone but himself.
Clinton
Our friend Gateway Pundit points out that Hillary&amp;rsquo;s soliloquy on Bhutto centered on the Senators long, close, personal relationship with Bhutto that lasted a dozen years.

                Just a few days, other bloggers (Captain Ed) and I speculated on the ramifications on Democrat surrender strategies of the increasingly obvious improvements in Iraq since the surge began. Ever the WaPo worried about how the Dems would deal.
Now we know: propaganda.
Following the phony story that Gen. Pace would urge the President to cut troops in Iraq by half, the Red Crescent, today, released a report that a record number of Iraqis have fled their homes in fear of their lives since the surge began.

                For a couple of days, the wingnuts have been ecstatic over a story that Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Peter Pace would tell President Bush to cut Iraqi troop strength in half. I first heard the story on CBS Radio News Friday morning on my way to work. TheLA Times, quoting anonymous Pentagon and Administration officials, printed the the story in its Friday edition.
But the story was a fabrication, likely designed to quell the growing support for the war.

                It started in July with polls showing Americans were increasingly supportive of the war in Iraq. Then, the President&amp;rsquo;s approval rating began to climb. Then Congress&amp;rsquo;s approval rating fell to an all-time low. In between, the odd Democrat Congressman or analyst returned from Iraq saying good things, not bad, about the effect of the troop surge.
With thanks to the California Conservative and Captain Ed for finding this story, we find that the Washington Post is reporting that the Democrats are forced to shift their policy on Iraq because of the undeniable success of the surge.

Background Some say that I blindly support President Bush and everything he does. I do not. Nor do I publicly lambaste his missteps the way others, like Peggy Noonan, do. This blog, I hope, will explain to my readers and friends how I can hold several seemingly incongruous positions on Bush and the War.
 * The United States, the free world, in fact, was justified in invading Iraq and overthrowing Saddam * The war in Iraq was not successful in its early days despite the perception of a rout * The administration&#39;s greatest failure was kowtowing to the left * The symptom of that kowtowing was establishing a defensive posture instead of continuing the attack * Donald Rumsfeld failed the President by refusing to return to an offensive strategy * The key to victory is ruthless aggression * Republicans should limit criticism of Bush to recommendations that will achieve victory  Justification Following 9/11, President Bush told Peggy Noonan in a private meeting that every night he goes to bed expecting to be woken and told that Saddam has unleashed a WMD in America.

                Apparently, an Iranian army special forces unit is in Iraq training Shiite militias on the more effective methods of killing Americans. You&amp;rsquo;ll be pleased to know that the US is &amp;ldquo;tracking&amp;rdquo; them.
My question is, Why aren&amp;rsquo;t we killing them? The Kurds are, according this story at Gateway Pundit.
They are enemy combatants in an American occupation zone. We need answer to no one for eliminating this problem.
This points to my whole problem with the way the Bush administration has handled Iraq.

                The UN Security Council, today, finally got around to approving a 26,000-strong force to control the violence in Darfur (FoxNews.com).
I have a depressing suspicion that this means there are no Christians left for the Muslims to kill in Darfur. Expat Yank thinks the same:
 There are only two reasons a predator state engaged in fomenting widespread slaughter (the UN has not termed Darfur “genocide”) will voluntarily allow in a UN peacekeeping force: 1) that state has already accomplished most of its ”slaughter” goals (remember, this conflict began in February 2003), or 2) it doesn’t believe the UN force will be able to accomplish much of anything anyway, so its best to let it be deployed in order to get the “international community” off its back.

In his speech, Brown referred to Winston Churchill:
   The Prime Minister vowed to take Winston Churchill’s lead and make Britain’s ties with America even stronger.
  Mr Brown stunned critics by THANKING President Bush for the fight against Islamic extremism, and insisted the UK-US relationship will be his No1 foreign policy priority.

                Senator Clinton asked the Pentagon to describe its plans to withdraw from Iraq. The Pentagon—specifically, undersecretary of defense, Eric Edelman—replied in the most appropriate manner imaginable:
 Premature and public discussion of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq reinforces enemy propaganda that the United States will abandon its allies in Iraq, much as we are perceived to have done in Vietnam, Lebanon and Somalia
 In response, Ms. Clinton displayed the kind of hysterium one associates with under-medicated paranoid schizophrenics.

Bush supporters and detractors, alike, have made much of Ms. Noonan&amp;rsquo;s Friday Opinion Journal column about President Bush. As a fan Peggy&amp;rsquo;s, I was disappointed.

Yesterday on CBS&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Face the Nation,&amp;rdquo; Senator Kerry said
 And there is no reason, Bob, that young American soldiers need to be going into the homes of Iraqis in the dead of night, terrorizing kids and children, you know, women, breaking sort of the customs of the&amp;ndash;of&amp;ndash;the historical customs, religious customs.

                I know many will disagree with me, but must agree with Ron Fournier of the AP:
 At every turn, political leaders failed Katrina&amp;rsquo;s victims. They didn&amp;rsquo;t strengthen the levees. They ceded the streets to marauding looters. They left dead bodies to rot or bloat. Thousands suffered or died for lack of water, food and hope. Who&amp;rsquo;s at fault?
 There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of blame to go around - the White House, Congress, federal agencies, local governments, police and even residents of the Gulf Coast who refused orders to evacuate.

Jennings didn&amp;rsquo;t last long. Berated by critics as a pretty face, ABC demoted him to foreign correspondent in 1968. In London, Munich, Brussels, and other foreign capitals, Jennings paid his dues.

                A high school in Columbus, GA suspended a 17-year-old student for taking a cell phone call from his mother who is serving our country in Iraq.
 The confrontation Wednesday began after the 17-year-old junior got a call at lunchtime from his mother, Sgt. 1st Class Monique Bates, who left in January for a one-year tour with the 203rd Forward Support Battalion. (USAToday)

                It&amp;rsquo;s clear, based on documents recently seized in Iraq, that the terrorists are down to their final shots. Because of this, they carry out daring attacks, like the one yesterday that killed 60.
Now is the time to send pig skins to Iraq with the promise that any terrorist&amp;ndash;captured or killed&amp;ndash;will be sewn into the animal&amp;rsquo;s skin and buried. This will go for the remains of suicide bombers as well as those killed in combat or captured and executed.

 Ethanol prices have declined sharply in recent months, largely because of the rapid growth in supply and few new markets. Shaw maintains that refiners are ignoring ethanol and keeping the additive out of some markets where it is readily available.

We have been active indemanding action from the Seattle School Board over a disgusting political ambush of American service members last week.
Upon further review of theletters and e-mails issued by the Seattle School Board and Susan Derse, principal of West Seattle High School, I am determined to garner a more substantive response. Specifically, I expect every adult involved to apologize directly to the ambushed service member and to all members, veterans, and their families.

Some of the shock over Byrd&amp;rsquo;s incendiary comments may arise from the carefully managed but false image of Byrd. The mainstream press, liberal academicians, and historians have, for decades, portrayed Byrd as a kindly, intellectual defender of the Senate&amp;rsquo;s history.

                Dean Esmay hooked us up tothis fine column. As I commented on Dean&amp;rsquo;s blog, it reminds me of reading James Burnham&amp;rsquo;s masterpiece, Suicide of the West, in 1980. In the prologue, Burnham writes about looking over political maps of the world from ancient Egypt to the 20th century. He paints stark images of the West&amp;rsquo;s advances, eventually engulfing more than half the world. (Please don&amp;rsquo;t lecture me on the math.)

                Steven Taylor rightly predicts that today&amp;rsquo;s top story will be the Washington Post report that the White House redacted the whole of the report on Iraq&amp;rsquo;s economy from last week&amp;rsquo;s economic report.
The story claims that the good news about Iraq&amp;rsquo;s economy would be inappropriate at a time when so many security problems exist. That rings hollow. The President could use some good news in his European trip, and the whole world could use some good news about Iraq.

                An argument with a gentleman whose blog is called HairyFishNuts.com pointed out the need to remind people what the 9/11 Commission said about Saddam&amp;rsquo;s ties to terrorism. To wit:
   Iraq under Saddam supported international terrorist organizations to bolster Iraq&amp;rsquo;s revolutionary credentials, ensure his own role as Great Arab leader, and intimidate rival governments. In examining the history, methods, and patterns of behavior of Saddam Husayn in supporting international terrorism, some &amp;ldquo;truths&amp;rdquo; stand out.

                Four hundred people representing more than 1,000 anti-war groups met in St. Louis, Missouri, over the weekend. The aim was to define a strategy to get the US out of Iraq before it turns into a success. Among the &amp;ldquo;luminaries&amp;rdquo; present: Danny Glover and Tom Hayden.
Fortunately for the causes of freedom, liberty, justice, and common sense, the assembled lefties spend so much time decrying the vote count in Ohio and Michael Crichton&amp;rsquo;s book, they ran out of time to produce a strategy.

In his first European trip since re-election, President Bush displays remarkable statemanship.
Balancing between firmness and friendliness, the President places American interest first, yet he undeniably wins friends on every stop.
Sometimes, timing is everything, and the President dares to admit such:
_&amp;ldquo;This is the first dinner since I&amp;rsquo;ve been re-elected on European soil, and it&amp;rsquo;s with Jacques Chirac. And that ought to say something.

   I am as pleased as anyone with Condoleezza Rices initial performance as Secretary of State. Shes a smart, articulate, passionate defender of America and George W. Bushs foreign policy vision. But all the excited talk about Condi for President is wildly premature, and even dangerous to the conservative cause.
 writes Steven M. Warshawsky on The American Thinker, February 15. Mr. Warshawsky goes on to list some pretty predictable problems with Condoleezza Rices White House credentials:

                Want to know how Howard Dean thinks?
   I support allotting a certain percentage of seats in these elections for the Sunnis.
 Ponder that a moment.
The man who wanted to be chief executive of the modern world&amp;rsquo;s first democratic republic wrote on January 10, 2005, that he believes Iraqis deserve some sort of managed democracy in which votes are only marginally important.
Instead of letting the people, who can&amp;rsquo;t be trusted in Dean&amp;rsquo;s view, to decide affairs, Dean would have a team of fairness experts decide how to apportion seats in the Iraqi legislature.

I heard about it, followed the stories, and read the blogs. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like commenting here. The reason was that the story was obvious. Senior executives in the mainstream media believe that conservatives are Bible-beating idiots, Republicans raped poor black women so they can later eat the off-spring, and soldiers are murderers who enlist so they can kill without repercusion. Sorry, folks, but that&amp;rsquo;s how MSM, most college professors, a good major of the population of New York City, and Eason Jordan view us.

                In an interview with USA Today, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the once and future president of Iran, said the US and Iran have more common ground than differences. Running for a return to the Iranian presidency, Rafsanjani was clearly speaking to the White House through the press.
If he&amp;rsquo;s sincere and he returns to power, this could be a major victory for Bush&amp;rsquo;s foreign policy in the Middle East. Bringing a moderate or liberal government to Iran is not Rafsanjani&amp;rsquo;s goal, for sure, but, like Gorbechev found in the Soviet Union, any reform could spin out of control.

                Terrorists used a disabled child as a suicide bomber on election day, Iraqi interior minister Falah al-Naqib said today.
    In all, 44 people were killed in a total of 38 bomb attacks on polling stations. Police at the scene of one the Baghdad blasts said the bomber appeared to have Down&amp;rsquo;s syndrome.
    Mr Al-Naqib praised an Iraqi citizen who was killed while preventing one suicide bomber from reaching a crowd of people outside a polling station.

Those choice are: bring the troops home and use &amp;ldquo;other means&amp;rdquo; to battle terrorism, or grow the Army.

If we are over-extended, and we might not be yet, I think there is a third option.

PREDICTIONS:
Economy
The US economy will continue to expand at the fast pace since the Reagan administration through the second quarter. While new home construction will slow, service and other sectors will more than take its place. Unemployment will improve in fits and starts, but it will be more than half a percentage point lower by the end of the second quarter as the economy creates 100,000 more jobs than existed at the peak in April 2000.

                American military policy as most of us know it evolved in response to the Cold War. The Soviet Union represented a military commanders worst nightmare: equal or superior strength in numbers, technology, and intelligence, combined with a desire to conquer the world.
But, as we found in the 1990s, the Soviet Union was also a military commanders dream: a formidable adversary requiring American and NATO vigilance in the forms of large, new weapons systems, enormous training budgets, and hands-off intelligence programs.

Please read this post on today&amp;rsquo;s du.org. This girl says that we conservatives can&amp;rsquo;t be reasoned with, then goes on to say she has cut ties with all of her friends who support Bush, because, like our troops in Iraq, all conservatives are evil (emphases mine):

                Arguing with Sign Posts reminds me that liberals continue to say things that seem, well, silly. But some liberals are teetering frightening close to the truth.
Someone posting to the democraticunderground.org forum ponders whether it&amp;rsquo;s time for liberals to stop supporting our troops. Her reasoning goes thusly: George Bush is a known evil; those who support Bush support evil; 72% of American service members in Iraq supported George Bush; therefore; 72% of American service member in Iraq are evil.

Should that fail, perhaps he&amp;rsquo;ll sue everyone who voted for Bush. If John Kerry forces a prolonged fight in Ohio, he will have assured himself an ignoble, despised place in American history.

Well, consider the source. John Kerry believes that the world was a better place when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan. John Kerry believes that Iraq was a better place when Saddam was presiding over the murders of 300,000 people and the tortures of 5,000,000 and the enslavement of the nation.

                The Bush administration violated several of my rules of war in Iraq:
 Do not let politicians make military decisions; do not let generals make political decisions.  Tommy Franks has admitted that the declaration of the end of major combat operations was his idea. He hoped that by convincing President Bush to make that public declaration, our former &amp;ldquo;allies&amp;rdquo; would jump in to help rebuild Iraq. As a result, we stopped aggressive fighting before we had killed enough enemy.

                One thing we&amp;rsquo;ve learned from the CBS Memogate unraveling: if you need to get in touch with the Kerry Campaign, call CBS News.
CBS has admitted that its producer, Mary Mapes, arranged for a telephone conversation between Bill Burkett, source of the infamous memos, and Joe Lockhart, senior advisor to Senator Kerry and former Clinton press secretary.
According to USA Today new ethics experts, the contacts raise serious ethics questions, pointing to the possibility that CBS is using its power as a major television news network to influence the outcome of the Presidential election according to its liberal bias.

 One year suspension of credentials to all federal government offices and events. Ban CBS from the presidential debates this fall.  These steps will ensure that the reorganized CBS News staff place objectivity and ethics before party politics and sensationalism.

                Okay, this is simple enough for even John Kerry and Howard Dean supporters to understand: American service members are safer serving in Iraq than they are in the US.
The US mortality rate, according to the Centers for Disease Control, is 834 deaths per 100,000 of population per year. There have been 200,000 (average) US troops in Iraq for 18 months. The death rate for 200,000 Americans should be 1,668 per year, meaning that since the start of the war, statistically you&amp;rsquo;d expect 2,502 Americans to have died.

Thus spake al Qaeda through two Arabic web sites. The date is July 15. The truce was to give European nations time to pull all troops out of Muslim countries, presumably Afghanistan included.
How will Europe respond? Why not America?
Al Qaeda should that it still has the capability to strike in Europe by the train in Spain bombing that changed that country&amp;rsquo;s government and policy.

                Newsweek, via MSNBC, has a story about the &amp;ldquo;famine&amp;rdquo; in Sudan. What the f*ck? When Muslim extremists murder scores, burn villages, block food relief, burn crops, and lay waste to an entire country, it&amp;rsquo;s not A GODDAMN FAMINE! It&amp;rsquo;s murder, genocide, evil-incarnate. It&amp;rsquo;s a spineless, greedy, UN chief taking money under the table to keep his mouth shut, as he did with Saddam.

Saddam used bribes to UN Officials to divert $10 billion from food and medicine for the Iraqi people to building palaces and killing people he didn&amp;rsquo;t like. The UN quietly endorsed this practice.
Giving money to UN relief agencies is more than a waste: it&amp;rsquo;s supporting corruption that kills innocent people.

The US, British, Polish, Turkish, Czech, South Korean, Japanese, and other troops are now guests of the interim government.
Just months ago, critics claimed that June 30 was a ridiculous date, that the Iraqis, being dark-skinned people who don&amp;rsquo;t speak English natively, would never be able to handle the responsibilities of self-governance with so little preparation.

Howard Dean potentially faces criminal charges for releasing secret security plans for the Yankee Nuclear Power plant after 9/11/01. He won&amp;rsquo;t release records of meetings from his 11 years as governor, but he&amp;rsquo;s pretty fast and loose with national security plans whose compromise could give terrorists the information they need to overcome that security.

                Everyone does it, so Ill join the fray. If you feel tempted to wager based on these predictions, please just send the money to me: I need, and your chances of getting a return are much better.
Economy
The US economy will continue to expand at the fast pace since the Reagan administration through the second quarter. While new home construction will slow, service and other sectors will more than take its place.

                Back in 1989, the term Peace Dividend was all the rage. Peace Dividend referred to money Democrats could spend on welfare programs and pork as a result of the end of the Cold War. Today, Bush and Blair announced a new, better, and real dividend: the dividends of war.
After seeing the effectiveness of Bush&amp;rsquo;s policy in overthrowing Saddam, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has admitted trying to develop weapons of mass destruction &amp;ndash; but now plans to dismantle all such programs.

                The vassal of vascilationville, Kofi Annan, is frustrated that the US and the Iraqi Governing Council are not giveing him &amp;ldquo;specific answers&amp;rdquo; to his questions regarding the UN&amp;rsquo;s role in post-war Iraq. The ballsy son-of-a-*** is sounding pretty damn uppity about it.

                Well, the President gets more positive coverage with a press conference, the Army announces the arrests of Iraqi resistence leaders based on information contained in documents found with Saddam, and the markets respond by turning down. The Dow, up by more tha 80 points earlier in the day, is at &#43;60, while NASDAQ is just about flat at &#43;2.
The American investor class knows nothing of patriotism. Sometimes, at seminal moments in history, it is right to subordinate your personal wealth to the national or world good.
