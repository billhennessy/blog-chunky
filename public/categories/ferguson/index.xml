      <description>Dellena Jones’s 911 Hair Salon was attacked at about 11:15 PM by a small band of young men. The break-in and robbery occurred close to the time of the first shooting. The hair salon is less than 100 yards from the scene of the shooting.
But that didn&amp;rsquo;t stop volunteers from St. Louis Tea Party Coalition and friends from helping.

      <description>St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters &amp;ldquo;there was a remarkable amount of gunfire out there,&amp;rdquo; describing the scene on W. Florissant last night.
A shooter confronted plain-clothes officers and opened fire. Officers returned fire, striking the suspect. The suspect is in critical, unstable condition in a local hospital. One officer was treated, but the severity and cause of his injury is unknown.
The shooting and at least one break-in of a business marred what had been peaceful commemorations of the death of Michael Brown.</description>

      <title>How Emphasis on Race Hurts Efforts to Reform Municipal Courts</title>

      <description>My story on the Justice Department&amp;rsquo;s Ferguson report addressed race early. .
So let&amp;rsquo;s have a little blunt talk about race from a West County white guy&amp;rsquo;s point of view (which is alway helpful).
Faction A and Faction B Whenever race comes up, two large factions shut down. They shut down intellectually because &amp;lsquo;race&amp;rsquo; touches an irrational, emotional nerve.
Faction A views every issue as a race problem. They see rain at a picnic as racist.</description>

      <description>The will of man is not shattered, but softened, bent, and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy, but it prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, but it compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.</description>
