      <description>Michael Laprarie asks:
 Now should we conclude that Democrats hate McCain voters and have no remorse over seeing them freeze and die?
 Rednecks die, no one cries (Wizbang)
The answer, of course, is “yes.” Barack Obama is president of blacks, illegal aliens, abortionists, communists, socialists, enviro-terrorists, Islamo-terrorists, and the mentally ill.
Since the white, Republican folks in Appalachia fit none of these categories, Obama’s happy to watch them suffer and die.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s first and ten again.
Most years New Years just sort of happens. It arrives. Getting out of 2008 felt like we went for it on 4th and 13 deep inside our own territory. We pulled the goalie and went with a sixth attacker. We sent an injured Albert Pujols to pinch hit for our best reliever. We pulled out all the stops.
The year 2008 will go down as a watershed year.</description>

      <title>Communism in America</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve received some notes and e-mails from friends who say I&amp;rsquo;m overboard in my rhetoric about Obama&amp;rsquo;s potential to communize the USA. I respect them, but they&amp;rsquo;re simply wrong.
In Philadelphia, you can be arrested simply for wearing McCain-Palin t-shirts, as proven in this video.
And these are Philly&amp;rsquo;s finest, not Obama&amp;rsquo;s promised jack-booted thugs.
Be vigilant, America. Sleep with one eye open. Remember the words of William Wallace in the movie Braveheart:</description>
