      <description>The holy Rosary is a powerful weapon!
St. Josemaria Escriva
 On Sunday, October 7 at 3:30 p.m. Central (and simultaneously across the USA and the whole world), millions will say the Rosary in unison. Will you join us?
 We are at war. A war without borders, where no man is exempt but where most haven’t recognized, let alone been trained, to fight. Casualties often go unseen, but very few are left unwounded.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time. Powerful and corrupt people want to undo the 2016 election. In Washington. In Missouri.
Win or lose, Americans deal with the results of elections. Our commitment to open, public government, of the people, by, the people, for people, has sustained this nation. And made it the greatest nation in the history of humanity.
But dark forces in Missouri want to turn your government into their private club. A club managed by corrupt business who rely on tax dollars to keep their failed enterprises afloat.</description>

      <description>Jack Kemp is on the top of my wall of heroes. Literally. An autographed Kemp card sits on top of my bookshelf housing the works and images of my heroes.
As the NFL self-destructs, it&amp;rsquo;s worth reading about Jack Kemp&amp;rsquo;s work for civil rights. And for the Republican Party. And for conservatism.
Jack Kemp&amp;rsquo;s Activism Kemp did it all. And, thanks to Jeffrey Lord, we can remember Kemp&amp;rsquo;s finest moments of civil rights activism:</description>

      <description>You are a target. They want you dead.
You are a conservative activist. They call themselves &amp;ldquo;progressives.&amp;rdquo;
You want to live. And you want to remain active in politics.
They want you dead. Or submissive. Like a slave. Or a battered woman.
No, you can&amp;rsquo;t attack them. You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t engage them. They&amp;rsquo;re rabid animals. Neither reason nor normal persuasion can change progressives from their deadly habits.
So what do you do?</description>

      <description>Without comment . . .
 Jefferson City, MO, May 29, 2015 - A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Senate Bill 672, passed by the Missouri General Assembly in 2014, was filed in Cole County circuit court on May 29th.
 The lawsuit claims that the General Assembly ignored the constitutional limits to their legislative authority. The Missouri Constitution includes clauses that prohibit legislators from changing the purpose of a bill, including multiple subjects in one bill, or passing a “special law” that fails to treat everyone equally.</description>

They say the Export Import Bank is a tiny agency that creates jobs for small business while producing a profit for the Treasury. And rescues baby rabbits from dangerous predators. And it’s gluten free.
Call us skeptics.
We saw the news that Goldman Sachs used the Export Import Bank to secure funding for a financially unstable buyer—after paying the Secretary of State’s husband $200,000 for a fifteen-minute speech.</description>

      <description>We metDellena Jones during our first Ferguson BUYcott in August. Since then, St. Louis Tea Partier, Dottie Bailey, has made it her mission to help Dellena&amp;rsquo;s business survive and flourish.
https://youtu.be/r-ye3nSe2Vk
Dellena&amp;rsquo;s business has fallen 60 percent since the first riots. She&amp;rsquo;s repaired the damage to her salon, but business is slow.
Despite all her challenges, Dellena still found the time and energy to host Center for Self-Governance training in her shop on a Saturday, foregoing that day&amp;rsquo;s revenue to learn about freedom and responsibility.</description>

      <description>Paul Hamby asked a question last month.
I was only one of the many he asked, and, being the rude bastard I am sometimes, I took a month to reply. And being lazy, I figured I should get a blog post out of it.
So here&amp;rsquo;s my answer to the question &amp;ldquo;who inspired you to get involved in politics?&amp;rdquo;
In the Summer of 74, I was between 3rd and 4th grade (I think).</description>

      <title>How to Shame House Republican Leadership On Immigration  *ACTION*</title>

And, yes, &amp;ldquo;House Republican Leadership&amp;rdquo; is a code word for Ann Wagner.
Every victorious Republican ran on a promise to aggressively check Obama&amp;rsquo;s illegal executive actions.
They weren&amp;rsquo;t all lying. Only the &amp;ldquo;leaders&amp;rdquo; lied.
House leadership is trying to weasel out of its commitment to voters to block Obama&amp;rsquo;s illegal activities.
The House can easily** attach a rider to the upcoming spending bill** prohibiting any money from going toward Obama&amp;rsquo;s 10 illegal illegal alien memoranda.</description>

      <description>My phone and inbox lit up all morning.
Missouri Republicans are FREAKING OUT that Speaker Apparent John Diehl could go down to defeat at the hands of conservative/libertarian grassroots activists. The freak-out is over a press conference in Queeny Park at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, September 30.

I heard of the Stop Diehl project last week. On Saturday, mostly Republican volunteers began a door-to-door campaign in Diehl&amp;rsquo;s district to block re-election.</description>

      <description>Hi. Bill Hennessy here. If you can, please stop by 111 Clarkson Executive Park, Ellisville, MO 63011 on Tuesday, September 2 at 7 p.m. (RSVP Here if you&amp;rsquo;d like.)
I have something I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk to you about. It&amp;rsquo;s about the tea party movement. But it&amp;rsquo;s really about understanding two very important concepts:
*1. Living to our purpose. *2. Doing what&amp;rsquo;s important.
This is not a training session. It&amp;rsquo;s not an After Party.</description>

      <description>You can&amp;rsquo;t change the world in your living room.
That&amp;rsquo;s why a small band of (mostly) white people from (mostly) West County drove to Ferguson (and Dellwood) to shop tonight.
We targeted the small businesses that were hit hard by violence&amp;ndash;violence committed (mostly) by out of town agitators, criminals, vandals, and hooligans.
We drove to Ferguson to make two statements with our actons: 1) Ferguson is OUR community, and 2) Ferguson is open for business.</description>

      <description>Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it suck when Jay Nixon and Francis Slay get on opposite sides of an issue?
Where do we go?
They&amp;rsquo;re on opposite sides of Amendment 7, the largest tax increase in Missouri history. And you need to choose a side before August 5, because the ball&amp;rsquo;s in the voters&amp;rsquo; court.
But there&amp;rsquo;s no need to fear; Hennessy is here. And I heard Francis the talking Mayor on KMOX this morning (or maybe it was yesterday) talking about how much he loves, Loves, LOVES the 3/4 cent sales tax increase theoretically for transportation.</description>

      <title>How to Avoid Collateral Damage When Hunting for RINOs</title>

      <description>Lowell Weicker was a RINO. So was Lincoln Chaffe for a while. And John Linsday, the mayor who tried to destroy New York City in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
RINO stands for &amp;ldquo;Republican In Name Only.&amp;rdquo; Rhinos and Elephants are both pachyderms, so it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty clever name for people who join the Republican Party but prefer the Democrat platform.
The problem is, some people take the concept to extremes.</description>

      <description>Will help coordinate highway overpass demonstrations to support the patriotic truckers?
America’s truckers are heading to Washington, DC to demand respect for the Constitution. They’ll be coming from all over the USA, and many will come through St. Louis.

I’ll be out of town this week, so I’m asking for some help.
Let’s fill the overpasses with Gadsden and American flags, signs, and crowds to wave the truckers on.</description>

      <description>I just finished Level 1 Training with the Center for Self-Governance. While I have a long way to go to complete the training, I can tell you I needed this. Bad.
What I Didn’t Know I Didn’t Know It’s not that I was stupid before. And some of the political action I’ve been doing my whole adult life was affective, I learned.
The problem is, I didn’t know whether or not it was effective.</description>

A lot of my friends have asked “what were they thinking?”
Dr. Gina explains what they were thinking:
My Take
The Loudons took a big gamble. It’s about time someone did.
Gina is dead on. As I’ve been saying for awhile, we have to break out of our affinity bubbles. That means going to places we might not be accepted.</description>

In a free society, people have liberty to do anything except a few prohibited things.
In a totalitarian society, people have liberty to do nothing except a few permitted things.
In a free society, the people have a black list of things they must not do, and government has a white of a few things it may do.</description>

      <description>A friend from Dallas just called me. He said he met two conservatives from Ballwin who’d love to be involved in movement conservatism . . . but don’t know how.
I was shocked. And a little embarrassed. ** How can someone in West County not know about St. Louis Tea Party Coalition and The After Party?** &#39;

Clearly, I’ve done something wrong. I’m sorry. But I can’t just throw my hands up and walk away.</description>

We don’t know the day, but we do know the time: 7:00 pm in Forest Park on Art Hill (map below). The most likely days are Monday or Thursday, but because of the magnitude of this case, it could be any day of the week.</description>

      <description>In 2008, we heard all about the youth movement for Obama. We heard that the enormous Millennial Generation, born between 1982 and 2001, would destroy the GOP and everything America once stood for&amp;ndash;like jobs, family, faith, and hard work. And when Obama won, many believed the tales of the Obama Youth.

But many were wrong. Voters under 30 have had it with vague promises and glittering bullshit from that punk from Chicago.</description>

      <description>Missouri House Speaker Steve Tilley and Senate Leader Kevin Engler never tire of implementing Obama’s totalitarian agenda.

This time, Tilley and Engler are shoving HB 1193 through to passage. This bill is designed to score brownie points with Sibelius and Obama by creating a prescription spy network that monitors the prescription drug purchases of every Missouri resident.
If Tilley and Engler get their way, every time your doctor writes a prescription, your pharmacist will be required to inform Jefferson City and Washington bureaucrats.</description>

I received this response from Freida Keough, St. Louis County Director ofMissouri Precinct Project:
 My answer: We have 56 positions for committeemen and women in 28 Townships for St.Louis County. Did you know that 35 new individuals filed for these positions in addition to the incumbents. Coincidence? I don&amp;rsquo;t think this happened because people felt they have nothing else to do.</description>

 We took your comments regarding the Glenn Beck Program to heart. After further review and careful consideration, we have decided to pull all advertising from Glenn Beck programming effective December 20th, 2010.
 Then the president of the company, Bruce Simon, tried to deny his political motives.

      <description>A Washington Post/ABC News poll shows a major shift in sentiment toward (against?) the tea party movement.
I would not challenge the accuracy of the results which show the tea party’s popularity waning among Southerners and people 18 to 29. In fact, the poll shows that a full 50 percent of Americans now have a negative view of the tea party.
Sure, there may have been some chicanery with the questions to skew the results.</description>

      <description>The final poll before Tuesday’s special election to fill Jack Murtha’s unexpired seat in the U.S. House shows that Republican Tim Burns is neck and neck with Democrat and pork barrel specialist Mark Critz. (Yes, Critz’s campaign is funded by lobbyists and special interests.)

PPP has it 48 to 47 Burns.
That means GOTV will determine the winner.

      <description>Money Bomb for Tim Burns ends at 11:00 p.m. Central tonight!
 If you want the satisfaction of replacing pork-barreler and Marine-basher, John Murtha, with fiscal conservative Tim Burns, then contributing to the money bomb will help.
If you have friends or family in Pennsylvania&amp;rsquo;s 12th Congressional district, you might want to give them a call this weekend and ask them if they plan to vote in Tuesday’s election. (People who are asked if they intend to vote are 40 percent more likely to vote than those who are not asked (Cialdini).</description>

      <description>Ned Ryun, President of American Majority, has opened a new chapter in America’s conservative grassroots movement.
On Saturday, a crowd of several hundred 9-12 Project and Tea Party organizers heard Ryun explain why it’s time to move beyond the rallies at the American Majority Post-Party Summit in Kansas City. I have mentioned this before, and it seems to bother many people. I understand why.

The rally was the animating function of the Tea Party movement.</description>

      <description>Focus.
There. That was easy, wasn’t it?
Focus.
Of the thousands of possible activities and initiatives, choose one.
Our goal is affect the outcome of the 2010 elections. That has not changed since our first tea party in Febuary 2009 with it’s tag line “Repeal the pork . . . or retire!”
They didn’t fix the fiscal problems. We owe it to ourselves to retire them.
But how?
Let’s try this: let’s go out and meet our neighbors and family and friends.</description>
