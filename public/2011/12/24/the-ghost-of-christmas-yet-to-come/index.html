<blockquote>
<p>THE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.</p>
<p>It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand. But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded.</p>
<p>He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?&rdquo; said Scrooge.</p>
<p>The Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.</p>
<p>&ndash;_Dickens, Charles (2004-08-11). A Christmas Carol (p. 53). Public Domain Books. Kindle Edition. _</p>

<p>Nations are no different.</p>
<p>Dickens warned us about the dangers of putting money before God, about worshiping wealth rather than using wealth to do good.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the luxuries that surround us blind us to the real purpose of wealth. I’m not talking about charity, and certainly not about government redistribution. I am talking about the good society.</p>
<p>Liberty, the right to pursue happiness and acquire property, lead to wealth—a surplus of goods and currency.Our wealth literally buys our futures.</p>
<p>If we invest in earthly things, things that gratify our temporal sensations, our investments will rot and blow away with the wind.</p>
<p>If we invest in higher things, our investments will be repaid.</p>
<p>Scrooge invested in things of the earth. They made him miserable and despised. Just as his treasured decayed, so did his soul. And his body.</p>
<p>Simon Sinek, a man who’s dedicated his life to helping others find their purpose, learned the Scrooge lesson in Iraq. He shared his story in <a href="https://blog.startwithwhy.com/refocus/2011/11/the-definition-of-purpose.html">an amazing video</a>.</p>
<p>Just before the the appearance of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come, the Ghost of Christmas Present introduced Scrooge to two wretched little children, dirty and pale, who clung to the spirit’s legs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Spirit! are they yours?&rdquo; Scrooge could say no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are Man&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the Spirit, looking down upon them. &ldquo;And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it!&rdquo; cried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city. &ldquo;Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse. And bide the end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they no refuge or resource?&rdquo; cried Scrooge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there no prisons?&rdquo; said the Spirit, turning on him for the last time with his own words. &ldquo;Are there no workhouses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bell struck twelve.</p>

<p>Do we dread or celebrate our glimpses of America’s future? Is our Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come bright or dark?</p>
<p>Midnight approaches, America.</p>

                A college student asked me a question: Why join the Tea Party?

He was wondering why anyone would want to associate with people who behaved reprehensibly at two earlier Republican debates.
Here’s how I replied:
 Johnny,
 Sorry that I&amp;rsquo;m just getting to this. I get a lot of email, and sometimes I miss things.
I organized the tea party in St. Louis in 2009. I did so because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that governments accumulate power until they crush liberty and freedom.

                A friend of mine told me this story.
 He sat that there bragging about getting a tax cut for friends of his.
I said, ‘you do realize, don’t you, that you’re just like the Democrats, except you’re giving taxpayers money to a different special interest.’
He looked at me and said, ‘but our special interests do good with the money.’
 My friend was talking about the second highest-ranking Republican in the Missouri House at the time.

Lights, Camera, Panic
Imagine being on a stage. Searing white brightness reduces your range of vision to a few degrees of arc. You hear hundreds of people making the sounds that audiences make, but you can’t really see them.
Before you are journalists bent on catching in a gaffe, or unprepared, or vulnerable.
