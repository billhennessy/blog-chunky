Kids have a clean slate when it comes to credit scores. Sure, they don’t have a long history, but you can help with that.
And you can buy that 56-inch 3D LED TV you’ve been craving. In a few months, you might even be able to buy a new car—on your kid’s credit.

<p>Kids have a clean slate when it comes to credit scores. Sure, they don’t have a long history, but you can help with that.</p>
<p>And you can buy that 56-inch 3D LED TV you’ve been craving. In a few months, you might even be able to buy a new car—on your kid’s credit.</p>

</a>Think about it: most kids rack up a ton of college debt. They borrow and borrow to go to college. And they can’t even eliminate school loans with bankruptcy.</p>
<p>They <em>can</em> get out of the loan for your Hummer, though. And if they love you, they’ll be happy to help.</p>
<p>Besides, <strong>you <em>need</em> the Hummer to haul the kids and their friends around to malls</strong> and soccer practice, right?</p>
<p>Plus you’re establishing their credit for them.</p>
<p>Only one problem: <a href="https://www.carrollcountytimes.com/news/local/article_69a510b8-4133-11df-9116-001cc4c03286.html">pretending to be your kids by stealing their identity is identity theft</a>. And sort of like financial molestation.</p>
<p>**So why isn’t federal borrowing a crime? **</p>
<p>The US government has borrowed $14+ trillion using my Social Security number and yours. The same government has bribed older generations to buy their silence—even their complicity.</p>
<p>Worse, most of this debt has been charged to the accounts of Millennials. And their kids.</p>
<p>**Where’s the outrage? **</p>
<p>Thomas <a href="https://www.pafamily.org/_files/live/FamilyUpdateFactSheet09-01.pdf">Jefferson showed appropriate fury</a> at the notion of borrowing to benefit the present generation at the expense of future generations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I sincerely believe&hellip; that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity under the name of funding is but swindling futurity on a large scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then I say, the earth belongs to each of these generations during its course, fully and in its own right. The second generation receives it clear of the debts and incumbrances of the first, the third of the second, and so on. For if the first could charge it with a debt, then the earth would belong to the dead and not to the living generation. Then, no generation can contract debts greater that may be paid during the course of its own existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you were born after 1982 (Millennial Generation), I’d love to hear your thoughts on the matter. How do you feel about entering the workforce almost $50,000 in debt for things no one every asked you about?</p>

                Obama showed his breaking point today. The stress got to him.
Today Obama threatened to stop Social Security payments if Congress doesn’t bend to his will on the debt ceiling.
The president told reporters that there may not be enough money to pay Social Security benefits on and after August 3rd.
But the President lies.
Revenue from taxes and other fees would cover Social Security and other payments. What won’t be covered is additional borrowing to service the country’s already outrageous debt.

                With the debt ceiling negotiations closing in, it’s worth looking to Thomas Jefferson.

Jefferson was very opposed to federal government borrowing. (He was less concerned with states borrowing.) What I love about the quote below is Jefferson’s concern for leisure time.
 &amp;ldquo;To preserve [the] independence [of the people,] we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.

                &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rdquo; could refer to anything. Anything at all.
In this case, though, I&amp;rsquo;m referring to unemployment. Well, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m referring to the economy overall.
Unemployment rate rises to 9.1%, 54K jobs added « Hot Air
Obama has increased regulation, seized entire industries (auto, student loans, commercial banking, medicine), and borrowed more money faster than all previous presidents combined.
Obama is a one-dictator disaster. And an incompetent one at that.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a job, Obama made it worse.
