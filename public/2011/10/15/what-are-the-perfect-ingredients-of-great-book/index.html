                            <p>Writers are always looking for the perfect topic for a book. But there’s a problem.</p>
<p>What’s important to me may not be important to you. And what you to read about, I might not care about.</p>
<p>That’s why great books achieve a certain universality. They touch on the essence of life itself, of humanity itself, of existence.</p>
<p>Some say that the secret to perfectly spellbinding stories is a mixture of just three elements: sex, food, and spirit. That’s why Elizabeth Gilbert’s <em>Love, Eat, Pray</em> became such a phenomenal best-seller and movie.</p>
<p>I might claim that sex, justice, and military is the perfect American combination for a fiction story.</p>
<p>But I’m not here to talk about fiction.</p>
<p><strong>I’m here to talk about hard, cold reality served up by one of <strong><a href="https://bobmccarty.com"><strong>St. Louis’s leading conservative writers</strong></a></strong>.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://threedaysinaugust.com/"><img src="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/TDIA_Cover_LR_10-8-11-204x300.jpg" alt="TDIA_Cover_LR_10-8-11-204x300">
</a>Are you ready for the perfect conservative book recipe?</p>
<p><strong>Buy and read <strong><a href="https://threedaysinaugust.com/"><strong>Bob McCarty’s <em>Three Days in August</em></strong></a>_</strong>.</strong> _Read all about the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. Army Special Forces Sgt. 1st Class Kelly A. Stewart admitted to having a one-night stand with a 28-year-old German woman the night of Aug. 22, 2008. She did, too. Both knew sex was part of the plan when they left the discotheque near Stuttgart. Two months later, however, her story changed and the highly-decorated combat veteran found himself facing rape and kidnapping charges.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>During court-martial proceedings one year later, Stewart faced an Army court-martial panel comprised of soldiers who had recently returned from a 16-month deployment with the Army attorney serving as Stewart’s lead prosecutor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite a lack of both physical evidence and eyewitnesses to the alleged crimes, it took only three days for the panel to find Stewart guilty of numerous offenses — including aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, forcible sodomy and assault and battery — and sentence him to eight years behind bars.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the conviction was based almost entirely on the testimony of Stewart’s accuser, a one-time mental patient who, with the backing of the German government, refused to allow her medical records to be entered as evidence.</p>
<p>When several witnesses came forward during a post-trial hearing to reveal startling proof that the accuser had lied several times during the trial, their words were largely ignored by the court and Stewart remained behind bars.</p>
<p>Today, Stewart’s fighting for a new trial so he can shed the “sexual offender” label that will stay with him the rest of his life if justice remains out of reach.</p>
<p>Based on extensive interviews and never-before-published details taken from the actual Record of Trial, <em><strong>Three Days In August: A U.S. Army Special Forces Soldier’s Fight for Military Justice</strong></em> by Bob McCarty paints a portrait of military justice gone awry that’s certain to make your blood boil.</p>
<p>**Coming in eBook and print versions. Look for it at booksellers everywhere **<strong>Oct. 19</strong>.</p>

                This week last year, I read The 5000 Year Leap. Good book. If you haven’t read it, do so. You might learn some interesting things.
But don’t expect The 5000 Year Leap to change you. Or history. It won’t.
Now, if 70 percent of the US population read it, it might make a difference. Or maybe not. I tend to doubt it, but that’s fodder for a different post.
When tea partiers read books like Glenn Beck’s Common Sense or The 5000 Year Leap, we’re not broadening ourselves—we’re narrowing ourselves.

                You can’t call yourself a conservative and ask for education money from Washington.
Republicans dominate both houses of the Missouri legislature. You’d think they’d act like republicans (lower case). But when it comes to education bribes from Washington, many of our Republican legislators show little resistance to political seduction. We can help them.
On BigGovernment. com, Bob McCarty highlights the hypocrisy of blasting ObamaCare from one side of the mouth while begging for federal cash out of the other.
