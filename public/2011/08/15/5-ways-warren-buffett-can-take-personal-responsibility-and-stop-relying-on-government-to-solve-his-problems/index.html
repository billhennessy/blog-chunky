</a>rich. <strong>He asks the government to increase his taxes, and the taxes of others like him</strong>, as if he is incapable of doing that on his own.</p>
<p>Buffett is half right. He proves that government coddles people by** asking the government to solve his problem of guilt**.</p>
<p>To help Buffett learn to take care of himself, without government help. here are 3 ways he can assuage his guilt and built his self-esteem by solving the problem himself.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay all you want</strong> to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Go Galt</strong>. Make less money. Give away what you have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refuse all corporate welfare</strong> and tax breaks for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/22130601/">all Berkshire-Hathaway companies</a>, saving the treasury billions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return the billions in corporate welfare</strong> that your companies have claimed over the past 5 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay your poor secretary more</strong>. Increase her salary until she’s in the same, privileged, low tax bracket you enjoy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There. Three simple ways that you, Warren Buffett, can solve your little guilt problem <strong>without asking the government to fix your problems for you</strong>.</p>
<p>BTW, Mr. Buffett, please realize that giving the government 100% of your wealth and all future earnings <a href="https://stlouisteaparty.com/2011/08/11/does-this-explain-americas-downgrade/">will have almost no effect on the national debt</a>. But it will add your name to the dole.</p>
<p>Now, since we’re all capitalists around here, and because I’d like to get closer to your low tax bracket, where do I send my invoice for $250,000 for this advice?</p>

                And, he’s back.
Missouri House Speaker Steve Tilley (R-Perryville) has signed onto legislation designed to circumvent the Electoral College in presidential elections. Like his position on embryonic stem cell research and the national debt, Tilley seems far out of step with Missouri’s Republican base on this. And this guy wants to be Lt. Governor? Please.
This might be old news to some.
I see that Big Government’s Josie Wales blogged about the national effort last August.

Dan is an original Tea Party organizer. He’s been at it since 2009. And he’s just about worn out. According to the Wall Street Journal, Blackford’s given up his position in the Houston Tea Party.
 All the protests, the organization, the fundraising, the block-walking, has it done anything? Are we better off than we were two years ago? I say &amp;lsquo;No.’
 How many other people feel the way Dan feels?
