When your senate separated the fiscal responsibility provisions affecting union collective bargaining powers from a bill that previously included tax and spend provisions, you took a big step toward fiscal recovery.</p>
<p>For years, public sector unions have dictated states’ taxing spending policies through brute force. These unions were not elected by the people, but the people were forced to pay—or borrow—what the unions demanded.</p>
<p>Economically, public sector unions are not workers, but part of the of government. They are management. They imposed their demands directly on the people who pay the bill and who created their functions in the first place.</p>
<p>Unlike politicians, though, unions have refused to yield to the electoral process.</p>
<p>Your governor, Scott Walker, and your 18 Republican Senators displayed courage and decency throughout this ordeal, brought on by Democrats who shirked their duties by fleeing the state. You, the people of Wisconsin, show tremendous patience and courage, too, but standing behind your elected officials who are trying to govern.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/michaelreagan/2011/02/23/remember_patco">Ronald Reagan fired the illegally striking PATCO</a> workers, leftist pundits predicted mayhem. They were wrong. The skies remained as safe after as they’d been before. Federal workers learned a new respect for the American taxpayer. And the US economy, eventually, healed into a nearly 20-year expansion.</p>
<p>You, Wisconsin, have set an example for us all. So I lift my glass and toast you with your governor’s brother, Johnny.</p>
<p>Forward.</p>

                For decades, now, public sector unions have imposed onerous tax increases and service cuts on the net tax payers of many states. Wisconsin being among the worst.
What do I mean by that?
Look at what’s going on in Wisconsin. The people who represent the net tax payers—those who pay more in taxes to the state than they receive in salary—are being vilified, harassed, threatened, and assaulted by the net tax takers—those receive more in state wages than they pay in state taxes.

                Obama’s friends in the public-sector unions stage embarrassing rallies to demand more, More, MORE of other people’s money.
These aren’t unions that represent people who work in mines and factories. No, these are unions representing people who live off your and my tax dollars. (BTW,the military doesn’t have a union.)
So let’s see . . . The government does a bunch of stuff we don’t want them to do. The people who did it get paid twice as much as the people who pay them.

                Let’s knock off the silly political correctness, here, and admit what’s going in Wisconsin. The teachers are trying collapse the system.
The National Education Association is a radical, political organization whose primary purpose is not education but control. Threatened with sensible legislation that protects the people of Wisconsin from unsustainable and unjustified retirement benefits, these teachers decided to shut down Wisconsin’s schools.
The solution is simple. Do what Reagan did to PATCO.
