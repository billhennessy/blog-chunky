                            <p>For decades, now, public sector unions have imposed onerous tax increases and service cuts on the net tax payers of many states. Wisconsin being among the worst.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Look at what’s going on in Wisconsin. The people who represent the net tax payers—those who pay more in taxes to the state than they receive in salary—are being vilified, harassed, threatened, and assaulted by the net tax takers—those receive more in state wages than they pay in state taxes. In fact, the net takers have shut down Wisconsin’ legislature with the help of 14 cowardly state senators.</p>
<p>What the Wisconsin unions want to keep is the power to impose any taxes they want on the people of Wisconsin through collective bargaining. That’s right, state employee unions have the power to tax the people.</p>
<p>Suppose Wisconsin set a tax rate of 8 percent. Then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3mw49mk_x0">AFSCME (NSFW)</a> goes on strike demanding a 20 percent wage increase and a 5 percent workforce increase. To prevent chaos, the state grants the concession. Taxes must go up or non AFSCME services must go down.</p>
<p>But non-AFSCME services are likely covered under some other union’s contract. So the state has to raise taxes now, or borrow money now and raise taxes later.</p>
<p>Either way, unelected union representatives have imposed a tax on the people.</p>
<p>Letting unions determine a state’s tax policy is like letting a 16-year-old have a 12-pack of Budweiser and the car keys.</p>

                Obama’s friends in the public-sector unions stage embarrassing rallies to demand more, More, MORE of other people’s money.
These aren’t unions that represent people who work in mines and factories. No, these are unions representing people who live off your and my tax dollars. (BTW,the military doesn’t have a union.)
So let’s see . . . The government does a bunch of stuff we don’t want them to do. The people who did it get paid twice as much as the people who pay them.

                Let’s knock off the silly political correctness, here, and admit what’s going in Wisconsin. The teachers are trying collapse the system.
The National Education Association is a radical, political organization whose primary purpose is not education but control. Threatened with sensible legislation that protects the people of Wisconsin from unsustainable and unjustified retirement benefits, these teachers decided to shut down Wisconsin’s schools.
The solution is simple. Do what Reagan did to PATCO.

                Last week, the Illinois legislature passed a massive income tax increase on individuals and businesses. Overall, it represents about a 67 percent income tax increase.
In response, neighboring states of Wisconsin and Indiana have wisely mounted massive campaigns to suck businesses and people out of Illinois. Even New Jersey’s fabulous governor, Chris Christie, plans to fish the Land o’ Lincoln for some business transplants.
One state bordering Illinois has been notoriously silent.
