<p>Federal prosecutors, emboldened by leftist anti-military groups, will persecute a former Marine for alleged murder committed while he was on active duty in Iraq.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A former Marine sergeant facing the first federal civilian prosecution of a military member accused of a war crime says there is much more at stake than his claim of innocence on charges that he killed unarmed detainees in Fallujah, Iraq.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,405164,00.html">FOXNews.com - Ex-Marine Questions Prosecution in Civilian Court - Politics | Republican Party | Democratic Party | Political Spectrum</a></p>
<p>After Murtha&rsquo;s failed attempt to convict innocent Marines at Haditha, now the Justice Department is going after former service members. </p>
<p>Why, then, would any ever sign up for military duty?  The left will come after you until you&rsquo;re dead or in jail.  Nazario&rsquo;s attorney frames the matter well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This boils down to one thing in my mind: Are we going to allow civilian juries to Monday-morning-quarterback military decisions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, the answer is &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; </p>
<p>President Bush should grant Nazario an unconditional Presidential pardon immediately.  Don&rsquo;t let this trial begin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nazario said he was on his first deployment when his squad entered Fallujah, which he described as a &ldquo;high combat zone&rdquo; with insurgents taking shots at troops at every turn — with everything from AK-47s to rocket-propelled grenades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thirty-three in his battalion were killed in the battle. The first, he said, was a man in his squad. Nazario later received the Navy-Marine Corps Commendation Medal with a &ldquo;V&rdquo; for valor for combat and leadership in Fallujah.</p>
<p>Though Nazario was not physically injured, he was later found to have post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p>After leaving the military, Nazario worked as an officer with the Riverside Police Department and was close to completing his one-year probation. He said he knew nothing of the investigation until he was arrested Aug. 7, 2007, after being called into the watch commander&rsquo;s office to sign a performance review.</p>
<p>Disgusting. </p>
<p>UPDATE:  More on <a href="https://www.blackfive.net/main/2008/05/marine-jailed-o.html">Black Five</a>, including the prosecutorial abuse of a fellow Marine by US Attorney Jerry Behnke. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although there is no forensic evidence (no bodies, graves, grieving family members, Iraqi witnesses, damage, etc.), the US attorney filed charges against Nazario and ordered Nelson to testify before a secret grand jury.  Sergeant Nelson refused.  The US attorney offered immunity from charges in Federal and military courts.  Nelson refused three times - the last, on his knees in prayer, tears streaming down his face, but resolute, knowing he was going to jail for not complying with the judge&rsquo;s orders. The judge, US District Court Judge Percy Anderson, charged Nelson with contempt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sergeant Jermaine Nelson spent Memorial Day weekend in jail in LA.  He is still imprisoned and will appear before Judge Percy Anderson tomorrow. </p>
<p>Sergeant Nelson&rsquo;s attorney said that one of the reasons that he did not testify against Sergeant Nazario was because Nazario had saved his life several times.</p>
<p> More disgusting still.  Stop the Justice Department! </p>
<p>Thanks to Black Five, here&rsquo;s the persecutor&rsquo;s contact info.  Be careful what you say or write&ndash;no doubt this bastard will come after anyone who even smells like a veteran.</p>
