</a> Say you&rsquo;re the CEO of Wal-Mart. You get a report from your store in Valley Stream, NJ, that one of your employees was <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/11/28/2008-11-28_worker_dies_at_long_island_walmart_after.html">trampled to death</a> by your customers who broke down the doors to get at your Black Friday specials before anyone else. In the chaos, a customer, 8-months pregnant, suffered a miscarriage.</p>
<p>How would you respond?</p>
<p>Suppose you were the police who responded? How would you handle the situation in which the crowd, gripped by throes of a shopping frenzy refused to allow first responders to attempt to save the man&rsquo;s life? Not that they had anything against 43-year-old Jdimytai Damour, the victim; it&rsquo;s just that he picked a really inconvenient spot to die.</p>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;d have closed that store and all other Wal-Marts in the US immediately. Pay the employees, but close the doors for the weekend. Forget Black Friday and its narrow margins and high volumes.</p>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;d announced the end to Black Friday panic sales. Go back to your everyday low price policy.</p>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;d do nothing. After all, the customers want super cheap bargains, and the customer is king.</p>
<p>Suppose you&rsquo;re the police. Maybe you&rsquo;d handle this situation like a riot, seal the store, and process every customer inside as a participant in manslaughter.</p>
<p>With all the talk of an <a href="https://boomerconsumerbook.blogspot.com/2008/10/here-come-simplifiers.html">end to excess consumption</a>, this sad story indicates something else entirely. It indicates that many Americans are so obsessed by consumption that they&rsquo;ll kill anyone who gets in their way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When they were saying they had to leave, that an employee got killed, people were yelling, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been on line since Friday morning!'&rdquo; <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Kimberly+Cribbs">Cribbs</a> said. &ldquo;They kept shopping.&rdquo; [<a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/local/ny-limart1129,0,7044659,print.story">source</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ed Morrissey points out that this murderous mayhem occurred in preparation for <a href="https://hotair.com/archives/2008/11/28/the-black-friday-mindless-stampede/">the coming of Christ</a>.</p>
<p>This Christmas, let&rsquo;s take <a href="https://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/11/holiday-shoppin.html">Seth Godin&rsquo;s advice</a>: shop small, shop quality, shop local, shop handmade. Let&rsquo;s be satisfied with a single gift instead of measuring our happiness by the number of packages we open. If you can&rsquo;t bring yourself to do this the name of God, perhaps you can do it in the name of Jdimytai Damour. Or of the unborn baby&ndash;less than one month from birth&ndash;who gave his life so that someone could get an HDTV for 30 percent off the already low, low price.</p>
