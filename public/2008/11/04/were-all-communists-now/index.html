<pre><code>* Obama names [Bill Ayers Secretary of Education](https://billayers.wordpress.com/2006/11/)** [Carbon-taxes](https://online.wsj.com/article/SB122445812003548473.html) based on the pseudo-science of anthopogenic global warming will [bankrupt the coal industry](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/11/02/audio-obama-will-bankrupt-the-coal-industry/)** [Electricity rates will skyrocket](https://newsbusters.org/blogs/kerry-picket/2008/11/02/obama-energy-prices-will-skyrocket), forcing the federal government to nationalize the electrical power generation and distribution industry** Obama's minions in Congress will purge the Democrat party of moderates. Charges of &quot;corruption&quot; will lead to abandonment by the White House and Democrat party leaders. Joe Lieberman will high on this hit list** The government will take over the auto industry in the US in order to &quot;save it.&quot; Auto workers will be come government employees** Obama will announce that, due to continued economic and financial problems, the US government will permanently maintain ownership of banks** Electricity rates will be based on income and usage, allowing those above Obama's arbitrary line of wealth to pay the electric bill those below the line** Iran and Iraq will fight a short, brutal war which Iran will win after the US withdraws in 6 months** In March 2009, the US Congress will pass a sweeping &quot;reform&quot; of the military, cutting military spending 25 percent, eliminating most new weapons systems in development, and forcing the retirement of most flag officers so Obama can appoint friendlier faces** Either by replacing retiring Justices or by expanding the Court to 15 Justices, Obama will turn the Supreme Court in his personal rubber stamp** The US will sign non-aggression pacts with [Venezuela](https://venezuela-usa.blogspot.com/2007/07/obamas-first-mistake-on-dealing-with.html), [Cuba](https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2007-08-22-cuba-stance_N.htm), and [Iran](https://origin.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/) obligating the US to refrain from action against those countries** Unemployment will rise in fits and starts, eventually reaching 12 percent late in 2009** Congress will overhaul the unemployment system, granting permanent benefits** Congress will reinstate numerous entitle programs eliminated by the Contract with America and Bill Clinton** Late in 2009, Congress will create the [National Civilian Security Force](https://www.americanthinker.com/2008/07/obamas_civilian_national_secur.html) (NCSF), part of the Department of Homeland Security and authorized to investigate, arrest, and prosecute anyone suspected of crimes against the people** Congress will pass legislation requiring federal registration of all [privately owned fire arms](https://townhall.com/columnists/JohnSigler/2008/10/31/obamas_gun-restriction_policy_playbook) and authorizing the NCSF to perform unannounced inspections of the homes of fire arms owners and those suspected of owning unregistered weapons** Congress will re-enact the &quot;[Fairness&quot; Doctrine](https://www.heritage.org/research/regulation/em368.cfm), making it far more onerous than the last one; Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage will retire in the face of mounting legal bills and NCSF prosecutions** Iran will conquer Israel after a blitzkrieg of missile and heavy artillery. Israel's cries for help will go unanswered as Obama cites the non-aggression pact signed with Iran** In 2010, the NCSF will arrest George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld, charging them with [crimes against humanity](https://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/Barack_on_torture.html). A war crimes court will be established at the Hague. In July 2010, Rumsfeld and Bush will be handed over to the court for incarceration.** The worsening economic depression will make internet access unaffordable for most people, driving the government to nationalize the internet, regulating content and bandwidth** The Supreme Court will refuse to hear an appeal from a ruling that declares the Catholic church in violation of sex discrimination laws. The church will have 180 days to ordain and recognize a woman &quot;priest.&quot; After the church refused to comply, all church property was seized and priests ordered into service as chaplains for the NCSF.
