                            <p>Back in the 1980s, it was fashionable for the left to scoff at Reagan&rsquo;s economic notion that a rising tide lifts all ships.  Liberal economists and politicians sneeringly referred to &ldquo;trickle-down&rdquo; economics as a justification for the rich to keep the poor poor. Every responsible economist knew Reagan was right, but the left in America had no accountability. Many Americans, by 1986, believed &ldquo;trickle-down&rdquo; economics pure evil.</p>
<p>Today, MSNBC took it all back.  With a terrorizing headline, MSNBC announced, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22884491/">Working poor more pinched as rich cut back</a>.&rdquo;  Here&rsquo;s the meat of the article:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cutbacks by the wealthy have a  ripple effect across all consumer spending, said Michael P. Niemira, chief  economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers. That&rsquo;s because  American households in the top 20 percent by income — those making at least  $150,000 a year — account for about 40 percent of overall consumer spending,  which makes up two-thirds of economic activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow! From that admission by a liberal news organization, almost everything we on the right have said about tax cuts turns out to be true:</p>
<pre><code>  * A tax cut for the rich benefits the poor disproportionately.  While the rich use tax cuts to buy luxuries, the purchase of those luxuries allows the poor to buy necessities.  Given a choice, ration people choose necessities over luxuries, so cutting taxes for the top 20 percent of tax payers lifts the bottom 20 percent out of poverty.
  * Cash in the hands of people at the top of the income pyramid works its way down to the bottom.
  * Tax cuts for the poor a less effective at boosting the economy than tax cuts for the rich.  This simple math.  A family of four paying $1,000 a year in taxes that receives a 10 percent tax cut has an extra $100 to spend.  The same family of four paying $20,000 a year in taxes gets $2,000 in additional spendable income.  That $2,000 will eventually reach the bottom, multiplied a factor of at least 1.5.  So the poor get $3,000 if the rich get a $2,000 cut. That's $2,900 more than if the poor received a 10 percent tax cut.
  * Everything liberals say about taxes, spending, and economics is a lie.  (Okay, this article doesn't prove that, but 44 years of paying attention to what liberals say does.)
</code></pre>
<p>So remember, the best way to help the poor is to get rich, vote Republican, and demand a tax cut.</p>
