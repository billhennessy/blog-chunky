                            <p>Bill Clinton is famously jealous, selfish, <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2008/01/23/pride-and-petulance/">petulant</a>, and subversive.  He and Hillary haven&rsquo;t really lived as husband and wife in over a decade.  Bill&rsquo;s eight years in the White House<a href="https://liberalvaluesblog.com/?p=2792"> left a void where most presidents leave a legacy</a>.  He&rsquo;s best known as the president who turned the evening news rating from TV13 to TV-MA.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, he&rsquo;s angered Democrats and liberals by claiming, in so many words, that only black people are stupid enough to vote for <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2008/01/20/obama-calls-bill-clinton-a-liar/">Obama</a>.  He&rsquo;s also gone out of his way to draw attention&ndash;negative attention&ndash;to himself.</p>
<p>Others speculate that Bill&rsquo;s actions are typical Clinton Inc.  They are a package, and Bill would be as much the president as would Hillary. I bought into this for a time, but now I think <a href="https://addittothelist.wordpress.com/2008/01/26/clinton-sabotage/">Bill might be sabotaging</a> Hillary&rsquo;s campaign.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe for an instant that the couple has much affection, one for the other.  I also believe that  divorce at this point would damage Hillary.  Public separation and Bill&rsquo;s absence from the campaign, would, however, boost Hillary&rsquo;s chances.  For all of his fund raising prowess, Bill Clinton was never a serious man&ndash;he was a national distraction, like &ldquo;American Idol&rdquo; or Britney Spears.</p>
<p>So why is he out campaigning in a way that any idiot knows will hurt his wife&rsquo;s chances?  Why does he keep reminding America that it twice elected a man whose emotional age remains about 12.</p>
<p>Because <a href="https://www.observer.com/2008/joe-klein-sees-possible-sabotage-bill-clinton-bloomberg-pollster-sees-room-bloomberg-candidacy">Bill wants Hillary to lose</a>.</p>
<p>Nothing personal against Hillary, mind you.  This is about Bill being the The President.  Hillary&rsquo;s nomination would put her on par with Bill.  In <a href="https://www.againsthillary.com/2007/11/28/clinton-pathology-or-sabotage/">Bill Clinton&rsquo;s mind</a>, it would be the ultimate payback for Monica and the dozens of the other women he violated and violated Hillary with.  <a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080126170016AACSaOK">He won&rsquo;t let that happen</a>.</p>
<p>Had he come out and denounced Hillary as a candidate, his motives would have been obvious.  People would have rallied to Hillary, and even Bill&rsquo;s greatest admirers would have seen him for the fraud he is.  Bill&rsquo;s too smart for that.</p>
<p>He could have taken a back seat saying it&rsquo;s improper for a former president to take sides in a party primary.  People would have bought that, and it would have been seen as a repudiation of Hillary.  It would have hurt her chances without degrading his reputation.  But playing Switzerland would have stripped Bill of his influence.  He could not have claimed&ndash;even in his own mind&ndash;that he manipulated the outcome of the election.</p>
<p>Instead, Bill took on the part of Hillary&rsquo;s number one fan.  As her fan, husband, and supporter, he split the party into racially defined halves.  He&rsquo;s returned his party to the 1950s, lining up his Southern white Democrats against the &lsquo;uppity coloreds&rsquo; supporting Obama. He miraculously turned a party unified in its hatred of George W. Bush into a party on the edge of race riot.</p>
<p>No one can claim, now, that Bill Clinton didn&rsquo;t have a major influence on the 2008 Democrat nomination.  His mark is indelible, bigoted, brutal, and ugly.  Bill Clinton is sin incarnate.</p>
