<li>via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130703012459-17102372-why-chicago-is-so-much-bigger-than-st-louis">LinkedIn Pulse</a>Don Peppers, native St. Louisan, wrote that paragraph about cities and states blocking Tesla from selling its cars to the public. Missouri is one of those states, preferring to protect incumbent car dealers from competition over allowing the market to determine winners and losers.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s funny, in a sad sort of way. St. Louis was one of the fastest-growing cities in the western world in 1850 when goods and people moved on water. Then the city leaders tried to prevent railroads from spreading. Instead, the railroads moved to Chicago, stunting St. Louis’s growth.</p>
<p>St. Louis is in steep decline. Not as steep as Detroit or Gary, Indiana, perhaps, but, St. Louis is headed toward minor city status. We’re about to lose our second (and final) NFL franchise. We are dead last in the country in business formation. <strong>And we’re the largest city in the country without UberX.</strong></p>
<p>That last problem isn’t Uber’s fault: it’s the fault of St. Louis’s parochial mentality. St. Louis protects incumbents, even when the incumbents fail the people.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Uber announced free uberX rides for the Independence Day weekend in St. Louis. <a href="https://www.madd.org/media-center/press-releases/2015/new-report-from-madd-uber.html">Mothers Against Drunk Driving found</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In California, drunk-driving crashes fell 6.5% among drivers under 30 in the markets where Uber operates following the launch of uberX in the state. That represents potentially 60 fewer drunk driving crashes each month &ndash; a total of 1,800 crashes avoided &ndash; since July 2012.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>July 4 weekend being a period of partying, free uberX rides might have saved lives or avoided accidents and drunk driving arrests.</p>
<p>[<a href="https://petition.uber.org/stl/">click to sign uberX petition</a>]</p>
<p>But the Metropolitan Taxi Commissions said “no” despite St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay’s strong support of the free rideshare offer, the MTC blocked uberX.</p>
<p>Kim Tucci, co-founder of The Pasta House restaurant chain and member of the taxi commission, last week exhorted St. Louisans to stop criticizing the city and start talking it up. Yet, Tucci’s own taxi commission exemplifies St. Louis’s greatest weakness: parochial attachment to incumbent, crony businesses at the expense of growth and opportunity. <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/blog/biznext/2015/06/uber-looks-for-more-compromise-from-taxi.html">According to St. Louis Business Journal</a>, Tucci is one of the commissioners blocking uberX in St. Louis by demanding excessive regulation of the service.</p>
<p>St. Louis is dead last in business formation among the 50 largest metro areas in the US. St. Louis has lost innumerable Fortune 500 headquarters in the last 30 years. Yet St. Louisans still protect legacy companies from needed competition.</p>
<p>The world moves on with or without St. Louis. In the 19th century, the railroads moved to Chicago. Eventually, uber will give up on St. Louis and move to a smaller city eager for the future of transportation.</p>
<p>And Kim Tucci will continue happily serving pasta to a shrinking, aging customer base, ignoring St. Louis’s sad decline.</p>

                At the Pachyderm Club’s national convention last year, I overheard a Republican Missouri State Representative talking about HB 609. “It was the best bill I’ve ever been involved with,” she said. “Those people who just went nuts don’t know anything about insurance.”

If you read my blog, you’re likely one of the “those people,” the ignorant masses who don’t understand the fineries of the legislative process. You don’t appreciate how hard the insurance industry lobbyists worked with Jefferson City to craft a law that sold only a bit of you into slavery while ensuring the insurance companies remained profitable and your favorite Republican legislators had the money to campaign next year.

I am embarrassed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about this problem sooner. Or I heard about it and ignored it, which is even worse. Maybe I thought it was just the usual liberal whining about trumped up racial problems. Whatever, I should have listened.
On September 2, I asked a room of about 30 tea partiers, &amp;ldquo;Do you trust our justice system?&amp;rdquo; I heard a chorus of &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo;

I&amp;rsquo;m not saying poor people do bad things. I&amp;rsquo;m saying that, at some point, eliminating jobs and hope will drive people to take things. And they will take things by force. And they will show no mercy to anyone who tries to get in their way.
Right or wrong, it happens. And no militarized police force will stop it.
