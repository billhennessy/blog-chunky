<p>—<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/greece-and-china-a-tale-of-two-crises-2015-7">James Rickards, The Daily Reckoning</a></p>
<p>Well, ain’t that just dandy?</p>
<p>And it’s undeniably true. We were told that the 2008 financial meltdown was caused by entities that had grown too large: banks, insurance companies, corporations, derivitives. They’d grown too big to survive and too big to fail.</p>
<p>Their investors and lenders were wealthy and connected. They used their connections to nudge politicians to transfer their losses from private companies and individuals to government balance sheets. Governments, after all, can collect debts at the point of a gun while private companies are limited to annoying debt collection calls.</p>
<p>To cover their tracks, politicians passed ridiculous laws written by the very failed business people who caused the problem in the first place: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-will-pay-more-than-125-million-to-settle-us-credit-card-debt-probes-2015-7">big banks</a>, Wall Streeters.</p>
<p>And the result has been predictable. As James Rickards reminds us:</p>
<ul>
<li>The big banks are bigger</li>
<li>Bank assets are concentrated in fewer, more powerful hands</li>
<li>Derivitives are bigger and more opaque</li>
<li>Liquidity is worse</li>
<li>And the central banksters are out of ammunition</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/iran-knows-its-winning-nuclear-talks-2015-7">Obama’s State Department is busy giving away the farm to Iran</a> in pursuit of a “legacy.” But Obama’s legacy will be this: he left the world less stable, less democratic, less equal, and less optimistic than he found it.</p>
<p>We have a hell of a mess to clean up. It will likely consume the rest of our lives. At least, the rest of the lives of Boomers and Gen Xers. Millinnials may enjoy a brighter future after the storm.</p>
<p>Left vs. right, liberal vs. conservative, Democrat vs. Republican are all false dichotomies.<a href="https://hennessysview.com/2014/06/28/masque-red-death-american-style/">The real fight today is Elites vs. Us</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-07-07/china-futures-plunge-8-over-half-stocks-suspended-margin-debt-crashes-most-record">China is crashing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-07-07/greferendum-shocker-tsipras-intended-lose-and-now-trapped-his-success">Greece is out of control</a>.</p>
<p>Buckle up. We live in a world more fragile than it’s ever been. And fragile things break.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are so many fragile things, after all. People break so easily, and so do dreams and hearts.</p>

                Greece has voted to reject the “troika&amp;rsquo;s” bailout terms. The people of Greece said “no” to the central banksters who encourage sovereigns to enslave themselves under mountains of debt.
The Greeks showed remarkable courage and resiliency, and their example could disrupt the entire international banking system. Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge:
 The Greek people have spoken and they said &amp;ldquo;OXI&amp;rdquo;! So congratulations Greece: for the first time you had the chance to tell the Troika, the unelected eurocrats, and the entire status quo establishment, not to mention all the banks, how you really felt and based on the most recent results, some 61% of you told it to go fuck itself.

                The &amp;ldquo;Red Death&amp;rdquo; had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal—the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men.

                Ask yourself this: why did the stock markets rally today after Obama announced sanctions against Russians? I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to that, but first some background.
I&amp;rsquo;ve often said that Putin plays chess while Obama fumbles with checkers. I picture our president, chin resting on fist, brows squeezed in childlike concentration, as he carefully chooses between jumping Putin&amp;rsquo;s piece to end the game or getting another of his pieces &amp;ldquo;kinged.&amp;rdquo;
Of course, Obama goes for the kingship.
