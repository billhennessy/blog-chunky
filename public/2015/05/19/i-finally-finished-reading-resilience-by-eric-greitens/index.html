<p>I read <em><a href="https://amzn.to/1EYDWYB">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a></em> by Daniel Kahneman in four days. And it has math.</p>
<p>I read Eric Greitens&rsquo;s book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/1B8WJyA">The Heart and the Fist</a></em> in two days.</p>
<p>Why did it take me over a month to finish <em><a href="https://amzn.to/1B8WyU9">Resilience</a></em>?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure, but here&rsquo;s what I think.</p>
<p>First, the book compels action. How could I read this paragraph without writing a blog post?</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If we are trapped in a life where everything is provided for us, our minds fail to grow, our relationships atrophy, and our spirits deteriorate.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2015/03/22/you-are-entitled-to-nothing/">the perfect indictment of the entitlement state</a>? Of the SSI debacle? Of the five percent unemployment rate with a shrinking labor rate? Of course it is. So I had to write.</p>
<p>But the real action-impulse comes later.</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In the most prosperous moment in human history, tens of millions of people fail to flourish for lack of noble work to do, for lack of meaningful, hard, struggling engagement with the world.</p>
<p>Who could avoid doing something of meaning immediately? And I think I had some personal forgiveness to ask when I read this:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The Greeks recognized that great people could fail terribly and still be great. Wise people could sometimes be dumb. Courageous people could be cowardly. Honest people could lie, and compassionate people could be cruel.</p>
<p>followed by:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, in a culture that should know enough to be forgiving of human weakness, we often fail to remember that people are not great all the time. People practice greatness. They perform with greatness. People practice courage. They perform with courage. And then, one day, they don’t. <strong>This does not make them cowards. It makes them human.</strong></p>
<p>(Maybe that&rsquo;s why I refrained from commenting on the sad episode in the Missouri House of Representatives last week.)</p>
<p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/1B8WyU9">Resilience</a></em> compelled other activities, too. Like learning.</p>
<p>Uncle Pat gave me a copy of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/1Gl1JpS">Meditations</a></em> of Marcus Aurelius when I joined the Navy. I read parts of it, memorized a few choice quotes, and kept it prominently on my bookshelf for years&ndash;so people would see it and marvel at my erudition.</p>
<p>When I read the chapter on Philosophy, I felt like a fraud. So put down <em>Resilience</em> and picked up <em><a href="https://amzn.to/1Gl1JpS">Meditations</a></em>. This time, I read more diligently. And <em>Meditations</em> led me to read Senaca&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/1KgZhmR">Letters From a Stoic</a></em> and a shorter compilation of Epictetus&rsquo;s thinking called <em>The Art of Living</em>. (I recommend them all to everyone.)</p>
<p>Those diversion took time, but I learned a lot.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the book was working on me. I was changing. Well, not changing so much as doing things that felt uncomfortable. <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2015/03/26/i-am-coward/">I wrote about this</a>.  I&rsquo;m working on being more courageous and more fair and more honest, and I can tell you that it&rsquo;s hard work. It gets easier, but then I have to confront a more challenging obstacle. And it gets harder again.</p>
<p>I would love to tell you that you can live a life of wealth, ease, and comfort by following Greitens&rsquo;s advice. I&rsquo;d be lying.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/1B8WyU9">Resilience</a></em> doesn&rsquo;t teach the easy life; it inspires the well-lived life. Resilience doesn&rsquo;t come from having a big house and a big boat and the hottest fashions and the hippest friends. Resilience means earning what you have and taking pride in the earning, not the having.</p>
<p>I would have scoffed at this book had I not known the author&rsquo;s life. <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2015/03/05/providence-and-hope-in-missouri/">Eric Greitens practices resilience every day</a>. He lives the book. Sure, he struggles to live into the ideal he aspires to. Everyone does. But he&rsquo;s been at it more diligently than anyone I know of. For Greitens, the book <em>Resilience</em> is something of a memoir.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to spoil the book for you, so I&rsquo;ll stop here. I learned that I can&rsquo;t read a book for someone just as you cannot be courageous for me.</p>
<p>I want you to read <em><a href="https://amzn.to/1B8WyU9">Resilience</a></em>, and I hope, when you do, you understand why it took me so long to read.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s what Brian Johnson has to say about <em>Resilience</em>:</p>

Great leaders inspire thought and action.
But their real value? Great leaders inspire action. Hard action. Uncomfortable action.
I&amp;rsquo;m reading Resilience by Eric Greitens. I have already bought six copies of the book, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll buy more. I want everyone to read it. The book changes people.

                A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
But if that step is in the wrong direction, you might end up 2,000 miles from your goal.
Many believe America took a step in the wrong direction long ago&amp;ndash;about the time &amp;ldquo;progressivism&amp;rdquo; became popular among political, business, and academic elites in the early 20th century.
If progressivism was a step in the wrong direction, it&amp;rsquo;s led us at least 2,000 miles from our target.

Am I reading this right?
Has anyone ever surprised you with a wish? A wish that defied logic?
Yesterday, a friend wrote of his concerns about Eric Greitens, the Navy SEAL, humanitarian, Rhodes Scholar, charity founder, and former boxer who’s considering a run for Missouri Governor.
His concern began: “Most all GOP candidates proudly trumpet their positions . . . “
He was right, of course. Almost.
