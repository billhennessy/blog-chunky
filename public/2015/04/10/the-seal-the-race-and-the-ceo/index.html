                            <p>In its entire history, who was the <em>safest</em> CEO for Apple?</p>
<p>In other words, if you were a corporate recruiter hired by Apple&rsquo;s board to find a chief executive, whom would hire?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll answer this later, but first here&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<h3 id="who-would-you-recruit">Who Would You Recruit?</h3>
<p>In response to <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2015/04/09/the-greater-of-two-goods/">yesterday&rsquo;s post on Brunner vs. Greitens</a>, someone asked me a similar question about Eric Greitens. The inquisitor seems to question my judgment for preferring Greitens over John Brunner. I&rsquo;m sure he thought this was a killer question&ndash;one that would shatter my confidence in Greitens:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were a corporate recruiter, would you hire Greitens to run a major corporation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question is meaningless and misleading.</p>
<p>The answer is &ldquo;no,&rdquo; by the way. Corporate recruiters look for the <em>safest</em> candidate, not the best candidate. For a major corporation, recruiters begin with MBAs from a handful of business schools: Harvard, Stanford, Wharton, Kellogg, etc. They also look at directors on other companies&rsquo; boards.</p>
<p>Eric Greitens isn&rsquo;t an MBA. He&rsquo;s a mere PhD and Rhodes Scholar and humanitarian and SEAL who might put people&rsquo;s lives before profits. (God forbid.)</p>
<p>No corporate recruiter would have hired Steve Jobs to run Apple, Bill Gates to run Microsoft, or Mark Zuckerberg to run an ant farm. They&rsquo;re all quirky and cocky. They&rsquo;re all college dropouts. Not an MBA between them.</p>
<h3 id="apples-safest-hire-ever">Apple&rsquo;s Safest Hire Ever</h3>
<p>Apple fired Steve Jobs, then hired the safest possible CEO&ndash;the CEO of Pepsi who had taken that company to the lead in soft drinks. Steve Scully had a remarkable track record at running Fortune 500 companies, and he understood consumer marketing. He was a safe a choice as safe can be, and every executive search firm in America slept well the night Scully&rsquo;s selection was announced. Safe and sound.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Scully was, hands down, the safest choice for Apple.</strong></p>
<p>But Steve Scully wasn&rsquo;t the best choice for Apple. He wasn&rsquo;t even a good choice. Scully was a disaster who nearly put Apple out of business before the company had a chance to give us the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad, iTunes, Keynote, Garage Band, iMovie. Safe but awful.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs was never the safe bet for Apple or any other company. Jobs was a wildcard and a maverick. He could be stubborn, mean, and insulting. He went weeks without bathing, ate nothing but apricots, and wore the same outfit every day.</p>
<p>But Steve Jobs saved Apple from bankruptcy. The board took him back after the safe Scully&rsquo;s miserable performance. The Apple board re-hired a man they&rsquo;d fired just a few years earlier.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs was the best choice for Apple because <strong>Steve Jobs was great</strong> on  a scale executive recruiters cannot fathom.</p>
<p>Under Jobs, Apple became the most valuable company in American history. And, still, no corporate recruiter would even consider him to run a major corporation. <strong>Jobs wasn&rsquo;t the safest choice; he was the best choice.</strong></p>
<h3 id="does-missouri-need-safe-or-best">Does Missouri Need Safe or Best?</h3>
<p>Every candidate in the race for Missouri Governor is a safer choice than Eric Greitens. But I&rsquo;m not willing to settle for safest in 2016:** I want the best**. Safe got us where we are. Safe was John McCain and Mitt Romney and Dave Spence and, yes, Jay Nixon.</p>
<p>I will never tell you that a Rhodes Scholar, champion boxer, Navy SEAL, charity founder, humanitarian, and Most Influential Person and Greatest Leader is a safe choice. People like Greitens are out to change things, and change is always risky. But &ldquo;safe&rdquo; can be disastrous.</p>
<p><img src="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Aslanlucyreunition-300x124.png" alt="Aslanlucyreunition"></p>
<p>As C.S. Lewis wrote of the great lion Alsan in <em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then, of course, Susan and Lucy ask if this lion is safe — to which Beaver answers with his memorable line, “Who said anything about safe? ’Course he isn’t safe. But he’s good. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a corporate recruiter, and I&rsquo;m not choosing a safe CEO for some company. I am a Missourian, and I expect inspirational greatness from our next governor. Or at least a fighting chance at greatness</p>
<p>In 2016, I&rsquo;m voting for the best, and <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2015/03/05/providence-and-hope-in-missouri/">the best is Eric Greitens</a>.</p>

Ben deferred to me to tell the Greitens story. I went through the usual, remarkable life of a man, eleven years my junior, a century my senior. I told him about Duke, boxing, Bosnia, Rwanda, Mother Teresa. I told him about boxing at Oxford and becoming a SEAL.
Nothing from Brett.
