                            <p>&ldquo;What if everything goes wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remember asking myself that on the morning of Friday, February 27, 2009.</p>
<p>I was driving on I-44 headed to the Arch to host a Tea Party. My co-hosts were people I&rsquo;d never met: Dana Loesch, Gina Loudon, Ed Martin, Michelle Moore. Those were the three to offered to help. Others offered to speak: Jim Lembke, Shamed Dogan, and a few others. Others helped organize sign-making, food, sign-in sheets, and music.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never met any of them before that day. They&rsquo;d never met me.</p>
<p>Of the people who responded to the Facebook event page, I knew exactly two. I&rsquo;d gone to high school with them. The rest were strangers.</p>
<p>Among the hundreds of strangers could be crazies bent on destruction. Or hard-core leftists bent on destroying us. A bunch of neo-Nazis could show up and taint us all. Someone could get hurt. Many could get hurt. I could get arrested.  Or, God forbid, someone might hand a megaphone to Roy Blunt.</p>
<p>A thousand things could go wrong. In fact, the chance of pulling off a major public, political event as a first-time activist was extremely small. People were angry and frustrated, and I called them together for a meeting before God and press.</p>
<p>Whatever went wrong would be on me.</p>
<p>The fear seized me as I passed Kingshighway. I was getting close to downtown. No turning back. My son, Patrick, was in the passenger&rsquo;s seat asking questions, but I couldn&rsquo;t fathom what his words meant. &ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; I&rsquo;d ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>You know how I knew I was doing the right thing? The fear. Everything of value involves conquering fear. If you approach an activity without fear, it&rsquo;s an activity of little value to the world.</p>
<p>Eric Greitens writes of this odd brain signal in his book Resilience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Such fears are entirely natural and healthy, and you should recognize them as proof that you’ve chosen work worth doing . Every worthy challenge will inspire some fear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <em>Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life</em></p>
<p>When people say they&rsquo;re afraid of Eric Greitens, smile. They should be. Eric Greitens&rsquo; election is a worthy challenge, and worthy challenges always stoke up some good, healthy fear.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2015/04/10/the-seal-the-race-and-the-ceo/">Eric Greitens reminds me of Aslan from Narnia</a>.</p>

                In its entire history, who was the safest CEO for Apple?
In other words, if you were a corporate recruiter hired by Apple&amp;rsquo;s board to find a chief executive, whom would hire?
I&amp;rsquo;ll answer this later, but first here&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m asking.
Who Would You Recruit? In response to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post on Brunner vs. Greitens, someone asked me a similar question about Eric Greitens. The inquisitor seems to question my judgment for preferring Greitens over John Brunner.

You support someone for office. Call this person Candidate A. You&amp;rsquo;re all in. You&amp;rsquo;ve told your friends about this great person.
Then another candidate jumps in to oppose your candidate. Let&amp;rsquo;s call this person Candidate B. This insurgent has great qualifications. You campaigned for Candidate B in another race a few years ago. You&amp;rsquo;ve talked him up. In the past, told your friends to vote for Candidate B.

                I own a ton of domain names.
Most of them I&amp;rsquo;ll never use. I bought them&amp;ndash;and pay for them&amp;ndash;because I don&amp;rsquo;t want anyone else to have them. Many contain &amp;ldquo;teabaggers.&amp;rdquo; Many contain &amp;ldquo;teaparty.&amp;rdquo; Many contain &amp;ldquo;Hennessy,&amp;rdquo; although the cognac people had sucked up quite a few of those already.
Everyone should invest in domains containing their surname. Anyone who is even mildly famous should own the domains containing their full name.
