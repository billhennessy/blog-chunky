                            <p>Something weird happened in the stock market today.</p>
<p>Yesterday I <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2015/08/24/quick-note-on-market/">blogged about the stock markets</a>. I&rsquo;d been up early to see what was going on in Europe and Asia. I was watching US futures, too.</p>
<p>I decided to write about what might happen. And I told you about Ben Hunt, my favorite economics writer. Ben combines remarkable knowledge of game theory and psychology with his genius in finance and economics.</p>
<p>I also declared <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2015/08/24/quick-note-on-market/">the end of the Golden Era of Central Banker</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s good news in all this loss. First, stocks were overpriced. At some point, they will bottom out and it will be time to start buying. Second, <a href="https://www.salientpartners.com/epsilontheory/post/2015/01/12/Catch-22">the Golden Age of the Central Banker </a>seems to be over. And that is very good news.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I attributed the phrase &ldquo;Golden Age of the Central Banker to Ben.</p>
<p>Well, today <a href="https://www.salientpartners.com/epsilontheory/post/2015/08/25/when-the-story-breaks">I was tickled to find a new note from Ben in my inbox</a>. But Ben says my call on the Central Bankers is too early:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see very little weakness in either the US growth story (best house in a bad neighborhood, mediocre growth but zero chance of recession) or the Narrative of Central Bank Omnipotence. Do I think that the Fed is being stymied in its desire to raise short rates in order to reload its monetary policy gun with conventional ammo? Yes, absolutely. Do I see a significant diminution in the overwhelming investor belief that the Fed and the ECB control market outcomes? No, I don’t. Trust me, I’m keeping my eyes peeled (see <a href="https://www.salientpartners.com/epsilontheory/post/2014/05/25/When-Does-the-Story-Break">“When Does the Story Break?”</a>), because in many respects this is the only question that matters. If this story breaks, then in the immortal words of Chief Brody when he first saw the shark, <strong>“You’re gonna need a bigger boat.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(BTW, do yourself a favor and read <a href="https://www.salientpartners.com/epsilontheory/post/2014/05/25/When-Does-the-Story-Break">When Does the Story Break?</a> One of the best lessons in narrative and common knowledge ever.)</p>
<p>If Ben says the narrative of central bank omnipotence is unbroken, I believe him. And I read his warning of how ugly things will get when that story breaks, I shudder.</p>
<p>But based on the time Ben&rsquo;s email hit my inbox, I&rsquo;d say he wrote it&ndash;or edited it&ndash;this morning while the DJIA was up over 300 points. By the time I read it, <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-08-25/biggest-rally-2015-crashes-biggest-reversal-lehman">the DJIA had closed down 205</a>. It was biggest intraday rollercoaster since Lehman.</p>
<p>And then I read <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rosenberg-what-has-changed-however-is-significant-2015-8">this on Business Insider</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By my reckoning, most investors already have little faith in the political leadership of many developed economies. But there has been a deep faith in the ability of monetary policy to both lift asset prices and, ultimately, generate an adequate inflation rate over the medium term.** If investors start to doubt that – and the decline in break-even inflation rates suggests concern (Exhibit 8) – then things could get significantly worse**.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, from the same BI article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bull market is not over even if the unusual characteristic that was the powerful driver for price-to-earnings expansion is probably over, namely <strong>the power of zero rates and central bank/government ability to distort or manipulate the markets</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look, Ben Hunt&rsquo;s forgotten more about game theory and narratives and markets than I&rsquo;ll ever know, so I&rsquo;ll accept that the fat lady hasn&rsquo;t sung the end of the Golden Era of the Central Banker.</p>
<p>But I hear somebody humming.</p>

                The GOP didn’t really have a plan in place in case it lost. It certainly didn’t have a plan for getting snotclobbered. And if you try to spin Tuesday’s results as anything less than a good old-fashioned ass-kicking, you’re deluding yourself.

                If Mitt Romney applied game theory in choosing Paul Ryan, I have renewed respect for him. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why, but first a bit of background on game theory.
Game theory is a branch of social science concerned with strategic decision-making. It is most closely associated with economics. Professor John Nash, the subject of the movie A Beautiful Mind, won a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in game theory. (For a great primer on the subject, read Thinking Strategically: the competitive advantage in business, politics, and everyday life.
