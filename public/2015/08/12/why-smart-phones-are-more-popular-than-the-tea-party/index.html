</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/233230">Seriously</a>.</p>
<p>It should bother you. [olympus_highlight color='yellow]Without essential freedoms, smart phones can be taken away or banned[/olympus_highlight]. And without those freedoms, the iPhone would never have existed. Technology innovations are a symptom of many things, and <strong>freedom is a the top of the list</strong>.</p>
<p>Why would people who cherish their handheld devices be so casual about the enabling condition for those devices?</p>
<p><strong>We are the problem.</strong> Not what we believe, but the things we say and write.</p>
<p>Conservatives tend to sell their beliefs the way some engineers sell their products. <strong>We rattle off features.</strong> We repeat quotes that might have been effective in the 18th century. We talk about the Constitution as if anyone but us even knows why that&rsquo;s important. They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If Steve Jobs had introduced the iPhone by describing the processing rate of its CPU or the materials comprising its battery, the iPhone would have sold about 1 million units. Half a billion dollars in sales is nothing to sneeze at, but an entire industry would never have happened.</p>
<p>No one bought the iPhone because of what the battery’s made of. No one bought the iPod because of the meticulous etchings of its motherboard.</p>
<p>People bought the iPhone because it made them feel special. They bought a connection with iconoclastic designers who worried about things like 1,000 songs in your pocket.[olympus_highlight color='yellow]They bought the iPhone because doing so connected them physically to  company that makes insanely great products that people love. <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2015/08/11/how-to-sell-conservative-principles/">They didn’t buy what Apple made; they bought why Apple made it.</a>[/olympus_highlight]</p>
<p>Consider the difference in these two pitches:</p>
<ol>
<li>We believe in Constitutionally limited government.</li>
<li>We believe that every American has inherent, God-given value and deserves the dignity of meaningful work and the freedom to pursue his own happiness.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both pitches are really saying the same thing. The first is what. The second is why. Further, the second pitch is a “why” that almost no one could object to. I’ll go further—<strong>it’s a “why” almost every American will champion</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tea-party-approval.png" alt="tea-party-approval"></p>
<p>No one outside our little circle has a mental model of what “Constitutionally limited government” looks like. (Only <a href="https://www.gallup.com/poll/147635/tea-party-movement.aspx">19 percent of Americans support the tea party</a>.)  And it’s not their job to develop one. [olympus_highlight color='yellow]<strong>Everyone has a mental model of the dignity of meaningful work</strong> and the freedom to pursue happiness[/olympus_highlight].</p>
<p>No one outside our little circle understands precisely what we mean by  &ldquo;Constitutionally limited government.&rdquo; Most people would agree with the idea of constitutionally limited government, but the persuadable population assumes we already have one. And 50 percent of American voters are persuadable.</p>
<p>Most Americans do understand that [olympus_highlight color='yellow]<strong>a welfare check is no substitute for a pay check</strong>[/olympus_highlight]. Most Americans can feel the pain of unemployment, even if they’ve never directly experienced it. Most American have felt the frustration of constraints imposed by an overactive government.</p>
<p><a href="https://hennessysview.com/2015/08/10/do-you-really-want-your-principles-to-win/">Conservatism is a smart phone for your life</a>. We should sell it that way.</p>
<p>Conservatism is [olympus_highlight color='yellow]jobs and justice, freedom and fulfillment and happiness on a popsicle stick[/olympus_highlight].</p>
<p>We’re not selling an abstract economic theory or an 18th century book. We’re offering you the chance to own your own life.</p>
<p>** Do you want a job?
** Do you want a paycheck that’s not missing a zero or two because of taxes?
** Do you want the freedom to quit your job and start your own gig with a reasonable expectation of success?
** Do you want your kids to be financially better off than you?
** Do you want your kids to enjoy at least as much freedom to guide their own lives as you&rsquo;ve had?</p>
<p>That’s what we offer. <strong>We reject the idea that poor people are burdens to managed.</strong> Instead, we believe that [olympus_highlight color='yellow]all people are assets to the community who deserve the dignity of meaningful work and the freedom to own their own lives[/olympus_highlight]. We believe that productive people who experience the blessings of work are more likely to become active members of the community, looking out for themselves, their families, and their neighbors.</p>
<p>I believe in Constitutionally limited government. But I also realize 81 percent of Americans have no idea what that means or why it’s important.</p>
<p>I believe that[olympus_highlight color='yellow]every person deserves the dignity of meaningful work and the freedom to responsibly enjoy the benefits of that work[/olympus_highlight]. And that enough people understand what meaningful work and freedom are. If we talk to the persuadables about <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2015/08/09/why-bother/"><em>why</em> we believe,</a> we will dominate elections and policy. <strong>If talk only about our features, we will remain an angry and frustrated remnant</strong>.</p>
<p>Why does this burden fall on us? Because <strong>we understand the why, the what, and the how of freedom</strong>. History has chosen us for this challenge. We should be grateful.</p>
<p>What do you think? How would Steve Jobs pitch the American Dream?</p>

                I confess.
When I write about freedoms lost, I don&amp;rsquo;t itemize the freedoms. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel too bad, though, because almost no one does. Itemizing sucks.
First, it&amp;rsquo;s hard work. &amp;ldquo;Losing freedom,&amp;rdquo; takes about three seconds to type and less time to read. Listing freedoms,on the other hand, takes that much time just to highlight all the freedoms and click the un-ordered list button.

                Events of the past week show the power of the Second Amendment to challenge government tyranny, regardless of the government’s firepower advantage. Let me back up, though.
A Smart Man’s Stupid Argument for Gun Control A year ago, the gun control lobby pumped a Facebook post by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, one of my favorite thinkers.
In his post, Taleb argued that the Second Amendment means nothing because the federal government has massively superior firepower:
