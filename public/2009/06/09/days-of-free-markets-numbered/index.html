The statists are moving faster through the Constitution than Hitler moved through France. Today, Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to advance a bill to socialize medicine <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/22/democrats-want-speedy-health-care-debate/">without debate</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>House Democrats went on record again in favor of advancing the legislation while allowing only limited debate, which would hobble the ability of Republicans to wrest concessions on one of Obama&rsquo;s top domestic priorities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>**Accelerating the **<strong><a href="https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/04/change-obama-guts-defense-spending.html">Banana Republic</a></strong></p>
<p>In the past week, the administration has encouraged political prosecution of former Bush administration officials, has opened the possibility of prosecuting CIA agents, has submitted legislation to give him sole authority over the Internet in the United States, and has released sensitive National Security documents to give terrorists an upper hand.</p>
<p>While the Tea Party movement concentrates on limited government and fiscal responsibility, the establishment of a Central American-style dictatorship in the United States cannot be ignored. It&rsquo;s clear that Obama intends to secure powers similar to Hugo Chavez&rsquo;s and the Castros&rsquo;. By the 2010 election, Obama could own all major US banks, the auto industry, the healthcare field, most major newspapers, and, effectively, the Internet. His opposition will be unable to fund a campaign or communicate with potential supporters.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Obama continues to undo free markets. He has refused repayment of TARP funds from solvent banks in order to maintain control. He has threatened to convert those debts into common stock, making his regime the dominant shareholder. He has fired General Motors&rsquo; board and CEO, replacing them with puppets. He has imposed salary limits on executives of bailed-out companies and has threatened to extend those limits to all businesses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most cruel joke of all, however, has been played by Hitler &amp; Co. on those German capitalists and small businessmen who once backed National Socialism as a means of saving Germany&rsquo;s bourgeois economic structure from radicalism. The Nazi credo that <em>the individual belongs to the state</em> also applies to business. Some businesses have been confiscated outright, on other what amounts to a capital tax has been levied. <em>Profits have been strictly controlled</em>. Some idea of the _increasing Governmental control and interference in business _could be deduced from the fact that 80% of all building and 50% of all industrial orders in Germany originated last year with the Government. Hard-pressed for food- stuffs as well as funds, the Nazi regime has taken over large estates and in many instances collectivized agriculture, a procedure fundamentally similar to Russian Communism. [Emphases mine.] (<a href="https://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1938.html">Time, 1938</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Substitute &ldquo;Obama&rdquo; for &ldquo;Hitler&rdquo; and &ldquo;United States&rdquo; for &ldquo;Germany,&rdquo; and you have a pretty good idea what we&rsquo;re headed toward. The article explains why Hitler progressively siezed businesses and industries: he needed them to for his massive social programs. Hitler built a mighty military, true. He also provided healthcare, food, housing, clothing, and work to every German, Austrian, and Czech.</p>
<p>Hitler created quite a national youth service program, too. It gave young poor kids hope. They wore uniforms and learned skills like picking up trash, marching, throwing granades, and spotting Jews.</p>
<p><strong>Stay Involved</strong></p>
<p>To combat statism, remain active in the Tea Party movement. Print and save important information you find on the Internet. Stay connected with the people you met on the Riverfront or Kiener Plaza.</p>
<p>The American Revolution did not end when Cornwallis withdrew. It rages on against tyranny and despotism. It was waned, gone soft, in the affluence of its success. But the revolution is now in the gravest dangerous since the Republic launched. History will record your contribution. Make your posterity proud.</p>
<p>Flood the House Switchboard</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t <a href="https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml">call just YOUR Representative</a>. Call 5 on Thursday, April 23. Call early. Lock up the switchboards. Let them know that we surround them.</p>

                This is my last post on Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View, at least for some time. My work for the St. Louis Tea Party movement is very important to me and, in my opinion, to you. Our government is moving quickly to obliterate all vestiges of the free market republic that America once was. With the Republican party in disarray and the Democrat party in the hands of statist despots, the tea partiers are the only thing standing between liberty and tyranny.

Too good to be true? Ask Charles: cjaco@charlesjaco.com.
On April 13, Charles Jaco reported on KTVI News that an organization called The Constitution Party sponsored and helped organize the St. Louis Tea Party. Jaco also claimed that The Constitution Party is a white supremacist group.

I will say only this:
   Neither Dana Loesch nor I is a member of the Constitution Party. I did not know of such an organization before April 14, 2009
