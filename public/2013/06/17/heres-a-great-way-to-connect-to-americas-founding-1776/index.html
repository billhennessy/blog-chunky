<p>You probably didn’t know that I was a theatre guy in high school and college. In fact, I was a theatre <a href="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/1776-poster.jpg"><img src="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/1776-poster_thumb.jpg" alt="1776-poster">
</a>major for a couple of years. I think the right’s neglect of the arts is one of our biggest failings. The arts reach people at an emotional level. Intellectual arguments cannot change emotional attachments.</p>
<p>So here’s a chance to rev up your American patriotic spirits while connecting with the arts. It’s <a href="https://insighttheatrecompany.com/">1776, the musical</a>, and a great St. Louis teacher and leader, Jim Leibrecht, is part of the show. Here’s his summary of this play:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just wanted to let you know that the production of **__1776 __**opens at Insight Theatre a week from Wednesday, June 26. It runs for 10 of the next 12 days, dark on July 1 and 4. Curtain is at 8:00, 2:00 on Sunday’s. Theatre is on the campus of Nerinx Hall High School.</p>
<p><a href="https://insighttheatrecompany.com/"><strong>TICKETS</strong></a>____</p>
<hr>
<p>I think you all know that I am now one to “enthuse” without justification. Well, I am about to “ENTHUSE” enthusiastically.____</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>I have to tell you that this is going to be an extraordinary production</strong>. The cast of 20+ is wonderfully talented as actors and as vocalists, and experienced and professional all. From the leads through the delegates to the entire company, <strong>the vocal quality is “awesome”</strong>. Voices are very rich and full, and the characters created are engrossing. (I portray Scottish delegate of Delaware, Thomas McKean, he of the robust and florid personality and voice). This is definitely one of the most exhilarating casts I have ever had the privilege and joy of being part of. Each one’s abilities help one to enrich and flesh out one’s own performance, which means it is a total company and ensemble presentation—doesn’t get any better than that. But all that is so much more wonderful because the libretto and music of the show are just great. <strong>The book is great writing</strong>; the music fully reflective of the characters, the situation. It is just a wonderful musical. AND the miraculous birth of our Declaration and birth is both confounding and inspiring. <strong>The show makes one appreciate what July 4 is really about all the more</strong>.____</p>
<hr>
<p>I invite you to come; I encourage you to come. <strong>You will find the production of a level of expertise to match any other you may enjoy in St. Louis this summer</strong>. You will be very glad you took the time and effort to share this theatrical magic with the cast and the production.____</p>
<hr>
<p>**You may check on ticket availability, and **<a href="https://insighttheatrecompany.com/"><strong>purchase tickets at the Insight Theatre website.</strong></a> Just Google it. The tickets are $25 and $30, depending on reserved seat location. I guarantee you will get much MORE than your money’s worth. There is a fee charge for purchase online.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will make at least one of the performances. If you see the show, please review it in the comments of this blog post.</p>

                This post is a bit unusual for me.
Strange and disturbing thoughts crowded my mind tonight—Sunday, March 7.
These thoughts interrupted my television viewing. I couldn’t really focus. Then, I couldn’t sleep. The thoughts won’t rest, and they won’t give me rest. So I write.
I’m bewildered by the world’s stock markets. Someone told the Wall Street Journal that, sure, the US economy seems to be tanking, manufacturing’s falling, the labor rate’s in the toilet.

                I don’t get into town to visit my dad often enough. That’s my loss.
Jack Hennessy, my dad, epitomizes what we call The Greatest Generation.
He helped raise his younger brothers and sister after their mother passed away. Jack was ten. His youngest sibling, my uncle Jim, was a newborn.
Jack Hennessy answered the call of World War II. He was a Machinist’s Mate in the Navy. He answered, again, when North Korea crossed the 34th Parallel.

                The St. Louis Cardinals were the major league team farthest west and farthest south until the 1950s. But that’s not the only reason the Redbirds built a massive flock of fans from the Alleghenies to the Rockies, and from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
The St. Louis Cardinals owe big government statism and technological innovation a big thanks, in addition to geography and great teams. The technology was radio. The big government statist?
