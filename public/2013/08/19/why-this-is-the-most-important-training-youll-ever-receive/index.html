<h4 id="what-i-didnt-know-i-didnt-know">What I Didn’t Know I Didn’t Know</h4>
<p>It’s not that I was stupid before. And some of the political action I’ve been doing my whole adult life was affective, I learned.</p>
<p>The problem is, I didn’t know whether or not it was effective. And I was incredibly inefficient. And I did far more work than I needed to for a given result. And I missed lots of opportunities to have far more influence on legislation than I thought.</p>
<p>I just didn’t know what I didn’t know. Before Level 1 training I had no idea how ignorant I was.</p>
<h4 id="how-many-of-these-questions-can-you-answer">How Many of These Questions Can You Answer?</h4>
<ol>
<li>What’s your school board’s election cycle?</li>
<li>When does your county council meet?</li>
<li>How often does your city council meet?</li>
<li>Does a bill “die” at the end of a legislation session in Missouri?</li>
<li>How many state senators does Missouri have?</li>
<li>Who is your county council member?</li>
<li>Does the St. Louis County Council change all at once, or are elections for the seats staggered like the US Senate?</li>
<li>Who is your State Rep and when is he or she termed out?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sos.mo.gov/elections/calendar/2014cal.asp">What elections are scheduled for 2014 in Missouri</a>?</li>
<li>What happened to 15,000 Witness forms filed by Missourians last week?</li>
</ol>
<p>I was able to answer a lot of these questions. But not all. Not half. And there are lot of other important questions we should all be able to answer. Like “how many votes does it take to win the state rep race in your district?”  And “what’s the voter turnout for April elections in your county?”</p>
<h4 id="playing-whack-a-mole-with-government-driven-issues-aint-working">Playing Whack-a-Mole with Government-Driven Issues Ain’t Working</h4>
<p>We’re losing ground. In Missouri, in the US. We’re all worse off than we were two, four, eight, 30 years ago. You know it in your heart.</p>
<p>We take pride in little victories. Block some tax increase here, slowing Blue Ways there. But we’re losing ground, not gaining. We’re on the defensive. Maybe we&rsquo;re not dying as fast as we could, but we’re not advancing. Which means, eventually, we will lose.</p>
<p>Unless we do something different.</p>
<p>Think about it. When was the last time you felt in control of the agenda? When was the last time a House Rep called <em>you</em> to find out what you’d like the General Assembly to work on next session?</p>
<p>Well, they call <a href="https://rockinconservative.com/">Brian Bollmann</a>. People like Brian who’ve completed Level 5 training from the Center for Self-governance get calls from school boards, city and county councils, state reps and senators, and members of the US Congress.</p>
<p>Level 5 teams have reversed the relationship of government to people. They’ve trained their politicians to obey them instead of the other way around.</p>
<p>Brian and the Cape Tea Party did it by <strong>paying more attention to skills, tactics, and strategies and less attention to the issues the government and the press has trained us to react to</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="get-your-training-now">Get Your Training Now</h4>
<p>I am going to complete Level 5 training. That&rsquo;ll require 40 hours of my time, plus about $180 over seven months. But it&rsquo;s more than worth it. I&rsquo;ve wasted more time and money on ineffective solutions to America&rsquo;s power distribution problem in the past month alone. I’m now part of a team, along with the other 22 people who attended Level 1 training hosted by St. Louis Tea Party Coalition yesterday.</p>
<p>If you missed the Level 1 training, <a href="https://www.tncsg.org/classes/">go to Center for Self-governance’s class schedule and sign up now</a>.  There’s a level 1 class coming up in Quincy, Illinois.  You’ll have to travel, but so what? We’ve travelled for rallies to Quincy without batting an eye, and this training will do far more to change the course of history than any rally every did or ever will.</p>
<p>Don’t believe me?</p>
<p>A millions people marched on Washington on September 12, 2009, to block Obamacare. Did it block Obamacare?</p>
<p>No. It didn’t. And claiming it did makes you and America weaker. It’s denial. It’s deflating. It’s pacifying and it encourages people to keep trying the same failed tactics that didn’t work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Memphis, TN, an African-America, hard-left Democrat is working with the local Tea Party to advance pro-liberty and fiscally responsible legislation in city hall.  Why? Because of the relationship local Tea Partiers developed after committing to self-governance instead of yelling in a park.</p>
<p>Get Level 1 Training Before September 21 when St. Louis Tea Party will host Level 2 training.</p>

                At the Pachyderm Club’s national convention last year, I overheard a Republican Missouri State Representative talking about HB 609. “It was the best bill I’ve ever been involved with,” she said. “Those people who just went nuts don’t know anything about insurance.”

If you read my blog, you’re likely one of the “those people,” the ignorant masses who don’t understand the fineries of the legislative process. You don’t appreciate how hard the insurance industry lobbyists worked with Jefferson City to craft a law that sold only a bit of you into slavery while ensuring the insurance companies remained profitable and your favorite Republican legislators had the money to campaign next year.

                The motivating force behind the first tea party protests of February 27, 2009, was , in part, crony capitalism. Across the country and on the steps of the Arch in St. Louis, signs and speakers denounced bailouts for failed businesses.
Rasmussen found that 68 percent of Americans believe Big Business and Big Government work together against the rest of us.
I think they’re right.
Since then, crony capitalism has only grown.

What is Todd&amp;rsquo;s real crime?
He&amp;rsquo;s a damaged candidate, sure, but he is not a damaged man.
He was wrong, but** he erred on the side of life**.
It says something about a society and political mood where a man can be disqualified for loving life and God, but another man celebrated for enabling the slaughter of living children with surgical scissors through the base of their skulls.
