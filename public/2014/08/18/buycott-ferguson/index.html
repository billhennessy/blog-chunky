<p><strong>LATEST UPDATES: 20AUG14 @ 8:14AM</strong></p>
<p>*1. Dress for very hot weather and hydrate.
*2. If you can&rsquo;t make it today, that&rsquo;s okay. See step 3.
*3. After your shopping spree, please email photos of your receipts to <a href="mailto:bill.hennessy@stlouisteaparty.com">bill.hennessy@stlouisteaparty.com</a> using the subject line &ldquo;Ferguson Receipt.&rdquo;
*4. After shopping, we&rsquo;ll be heading to <a href="https://fallonspub.com/">Fallon&rsquo;s Bar &amp; Grill in Overland</a>.
*5. Thanks to <a href="https://www.971talk.com/blogs/allmans-electric-stove/demand-audio">Jamie Allman 97.1</a>, <a href="https://www.indioradio.com/index.php?104">John &amp; Kane Show</a>,<a href="https://culturevigilante.wordpress.com/"> Lisa Payne-Naeger</a>, <a href="https://kmox.com">KMOX&rsquo;s Brett Blume,</a> and everyone else who&rsquo;s helped spread the word.
*6. Please remember, this BUYcott is in the name of peace and prosperity. Smile. Those are both good things.</p>
<p><em><strong><strong>Original Post Follows</strong></strong></em></p>
<p>Thursday, August 21, 5:00 to 6:00Â pm.</p>
<p>Dozens of Ferguson businesses have suffered damage. Not only do those businesses need healing, their customers need their services.</p>
<h3 id="we-can-help-buycott-ferguson">We can help. BUYcott Ferguson.</h3>
<p>Just as <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2013/12/04/favorite-st-louis-tea-party-wasnt-tea-party/">we helped Whole Foods by BUYcotting September 1, 2009</a>, we can help small businesses in Ferguson by BUYcotting Thursday, August 21, 5 to 6:30 pm.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to do.</p>
<p>*1. Go to W. Florissant on Thursday between 5 and 6:30.
*2. Bring a shopping list: groceries, beer, smokes, something for the kids, whatever
*3. Look for businesses with boarded up windows and spray painted OPEN signs
*4. Shop</p>
<h3 id="why-you-should-do-this">Why You Should Do This</h3>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s not much else you and I can do right now. Yeah, protests feel good in the moment, but they don&rsquo;t really change things.</p>
<p>On the other hand, every store you shop will be one step closer to recovery. Every store that recovers makes life easier for residents. Every life made easier gets you one step closer to heaven. And that&rsquo;s the only reason we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>Please watch HennessysView.com in the coming days for more details. Pray for this mission. It&rsquo;ll work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see 20 people join this demonstration of faith, healing, and free markets. Everything over that is gravy.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: DETAILS</strong></p>
<p>First, thanks for the great response. I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
<p>Next, here&rsquo;s the details for Thursday:</p>
<p>*1. The situation is fluid, and we don&rsquo;t want to interfere with police OR with peaceful demonstrators. So WATCH THIS BLOG AND YOUR EMAIL on Thursday in case things change.
*2. Some stores might be low on inventory. If it looks that way, ask. We don&rsquo;t want to leave local residents without stuff that we can buy somewhere else. With the traffic restrictions, Ferguson residents have a hard time getting out to distant shops.
*3. NO SIGNS OR SPEECHES. We&rsquo;re not their proselytize or politic. We&rsquo;re their to lead recovery, healing, faith, and free markets.
*4. MUSTER on the Sam&rsquo;s Club lot, southeast corner, around 5:00 pm. If you&rsquo;d like to start earlier, please don&rsquo;t wait. Here&rsquo;s a link to the map:Â <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sam's+Club/@38.7651138,-90.2786401,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xee35e1a60eda7589">Sam&rsquo;s Club,Â 10735 W Florissant AveÂ Ferguson, MO 63136</a></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>OBEY POLICE and respect peaceful demonstrators. We have been in their shoes many times together in the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SMILE and be friendly. It&rsquo;s been a hard week and a half in Ferguson, and a friendly smile will go a long way.Â </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Â Listen to Jamie in the Morning at 6:10 am Wednesday for the latest updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Â We&rsquo;ll designate a post BUYcott meeting spot tomorrow if you&rsquo;d like to get together for a little After Party. I&rsquo;ll update this post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Â Thank you, again. You are wonderful people.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, I read a story not long ago about a man who jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge. He passed about 40 people as he walked to a spot on the bridge. He looked around for a few minutes as more people rushed passed. Then he jumped.</p>
<p>When police investigated his apartment, they found a note. Among other thoughts, the jumper wrote: &ldquo;If one person smiles at me, I won&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You never know how your friendly smile will change a life. Or save one.Â </p>
<p>God bless you.Â </p>

                At the Pachyderm Clubâs national convention last year, I overheard a Republican Missouri State Representative talking about HB 609. âIt was the best bill Iâve ever been involved with,â she said. âThose people who just went nuts donât know anything about insurance.â

If you read my blog, youâre likely one of the âthose people,â the ignorant masses who donât understand the fineries of the legislative process. You donât appreciate how hard the insurance industry lobbyists worked with Jefferson City to craft a law that sold only a bit of you into slavery while ensuring the insurance companies remained profitable and your favorite Republican legislators had the money to campaign next year.

                The next St. Louis County Executive better brace himself for this: poverty is exploding in the county.
I&amp;rsquo;m not saying poor people do bad things. I&amp;rsquo;m saying that, at some point, eliminating jobs and hope will drive people to take things. And they will take things by force. And they will show no mercy to anyone who tries to get in their way.
Right or wrong, it happens. And no militarized police force will stop it.

                Many Republican voters pulled a Democrat ballot August 5th, in St. Louis County. Having crossed over once, how many will do it again in November? It is no secret that the Republican legislature in Jefferson City has exhibited minimal leadership on major issues while spending most of a short legislative calendar talking about issues invented by lobbyists.
Republican voters expected more.
Many St. Louis County Republican voters are baffled by the absence of political âgutsâ displayed in Jefferson City.
