<p>Spinks had the whole world served up on a plate. He tried to eat it all at once. He choked on it.</p>
<p>The Millennials are the largest generation in American history. Bigger than the Boomers. The first 5 years of Millennials (born about 1982 to about 1987) were dyed-in-the-wool liberals. But succeeding cohorts of Millennials have become increasingly libertarian.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re unhappy with Obama. They hate Obamacare. They want jobs. They want something to do. Oh, and they think marijuana prohibition is stupid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been opposed to pot prohibition since I was in college in the 1980s. Not (just) because I was smoking a lot of pot. Before that I read <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2013/02/27/weednesday-post-why-the-gop-needs-to-champion-marijuana-law-reform/">William F. Buckley&rsquo;s views on marijuana prohibition</a>. And I agreed.</p>
<p>After 2006, 2008, and 2012, Republicans knew they had a youth problem. One way to fix that problem was to reframe pot legalization as a jobs program. <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2013/01/01/its-time-to-end-war-on-weed/">Had the GOP taken my advice of January 1, 2013, they would have</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Created Jobs: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-31/pot-shops-in-denver-open-door-to-578-million-in-sales.html">Colorado sold $578 million worth of pot TODAY alone</a></li>
<li>Cut Spending: <a href="https://www.drugpolicy.org/wasted-tax-dollars">The cost of our war on cannabis is $51 <em>billion</em> a year</a>_
_</li>
<li>Stopped Hypocrisy:  Kids are looking for a party of freedom, and the war on pot prevents the GOP from seizing that title</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2014, I hope Republicans and conservatives grow up and face reality. The war on pot is over, and they lost. They can continue fighting it, but they&rsquo;ll lose every time.</p>
<p>The cannabis business is putting people to work in Colorado and Washington&ndash;growers, shop owners, distributors, truckers. Every warehouse in the Denver area is filled as a growing operation, forcing developers to build new warehouse parks. All that industry will bypass states like Missouri, whose population growth was almost zero last year.</p>
<p>So far, Democrats get all the credit for ending the war on week. A tiny handful of Republicans, like Missouri State Rep Paul Curtman, have the foresight to advance this issue. If the rest of his party don&rsquo;t get on board soon, 2016 could be another disaster for their party and for the country.</p>
