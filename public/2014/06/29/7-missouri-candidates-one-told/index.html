<p>How does that thought make you feel? Weak or strong? Impotent or powerful? Eager or dispirited?</p>
<p>Do you know why you feel forced to choose between the lesser of two evils?</p>
<p>Because you want to.</p>
<p>In almost every race, you have more than two choices. In the 2014 US House elections in Missouri, ballots in all eight districts will have a Libertarian or independent candidate, or both.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying to cast a knee-jerk vote for a third party candidate. I am saying not to cast a knee-jerk for a Republican or Democrat. Take a look at your choices. Tell your friends who don&rsquo;t vote that they don&rsquo;t have to settle for the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>To help spread the word about your choices, here&rsquo;s what I could find about some non-traditional party candidates who might be more appealing than the candidates chosen for you by the political elite. Or, as Politico put it</p>

<p>I believe in a limited government. Individuals should be free to make choices for themselves and accept responsibility for the choices they make. The Libertarian way approaches politics based on the principle of self-ownership — no group, government nor individual should be allowed to dictate or direct the life of any other group, government or individual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a proud Libertarian, I believe not only in a free market, but also in the free marketplace of ideas. We poorly represent the voice and will of the people when we restrict conversation only to those affiliated with a Republican or Democratic Party. We need fresh, independent voices if we are to rid our government offices of “politics as usual” in Missouri and beyond.</p>

<p>I could go to school for 50 years and never understand half of the things our government does and we have
no say in what they are doing to us. If this is a free country, shouldn&rsquo;t we be making the decisions instead
of people that we elect thinking they are going to be honest when they just want to get elected? I think we
should have more freedoms that are not overran by our governments laws because after all, isn&rsquo;t that what are forefathers wanted for us? This is not going to be a free country until we make a stand and get our
freedoms back that have been taken over by our government. It is your call, but I think we should make
a stand together so we can be free!</p>

<p>BTW, Blaine Luetkemeyer, the 3rd District incumbent, is the mother of all crony capitalists in Congress. This seat needs a new face in 2014.</p>

<h3 id="5th-district-roy-welborn-libertarian">5th District: Roy Welborn, Libertarian</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Over my job career I have done so many different things from fast food when I was younger, to construction, and finally for the past 30 years I have been in the Computer industry in various roles from Programmer, to Systems administrator. I have been dead broke, I have wondered at times where my next meal has come from, and I have been lower middle class blue collar/white collar all my life. So I know the plight of the middle class with struggling to pay for bills, gas, and food with what little money I brought in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have never held a public office not even in high school, and that is one reason why I think I would make a great person to choose for congress, I know when to call bullcrap, and I am very outspoken regarding what is wrong, right, and simply none of the governments business. If I am graced with being elected will not change.</p>

<p>One of the first things that I will do when elected is introduce legislation to eliminate federal funding of state, county, and local police forces. Yes, this will save the taxpayer money (about $700 billion since 9/11), but I am much more concerned about saving our civil liberties. There are too many cops, too many jails, too many drones, too many armored vehicles, too many SWAT teams, too many machine guns, and TOO MANY DAMN LAWS!!!</p>

<p><strong>IT&rsquo;S TIME FOR INDEPENDENTS</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>A New Way of Thinking about How We Are Governed</strong><br>
You and I have to do something different if we expect different political results. It&rsquo;s time for us to say to the Republican and Democratic parties, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving.&rdquo; These parties don&rsquo;t support us. Why are we supporting them? </p>
<p>A Gallup poll from January 12, 2012 says that Independents make up the largest political group in the country. Yet in the current House, membership is 54% Republican and 46% Democrat. Congress doesn&rsquo;t look like or act like us because it is not like us. </p>
<p>You deserve a new kind of voice, not another politician who knows his or her way around the political system, the system that has failed us and our country.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Vote for Power and Money</strong><br>
It&rsquo;s nearly impossible for politicians who get tangled up in the party system to not lose their way. The lure of party power is strong. But the price they pay is giving up their souls to the party line. </p>
<p>Representatives elected by political party power, or by special interest money, owe their allegiance to whoever paid their way. Our current representatives don&rsquo;t answer to you and me. They answer to their parties and to money.</p>

<p>Aside: I with all the candidates profiled here would check out Terry Hampton&rsquo;s excellent, professional website. One reason non-establishment candidates struggle is they don&rsquo;t do the basics right. Terry does. A high-quality, professional looking website is not expensive or difficult today. If candidates want people to take them seriously, they need to follow Terry&rsquo;s lead on website design and content strategy.</p>

<p>No one can use the &ldquo;lesser of two evils&rdquo; excuse for staying home in 2014. I know people think that voting for a third party is wasting a vote. So is not voting at all.</p>
<p><em>Note: I offered to profile three other candidates who did not respond to my request for information and whose websites lacked sufficient background to include in this post. And then I received Roy Welborn&rsquo;s info, which I&rsquo;ve added.</em></p>

                You know how reckless and tone-deaf Obama is about Army deserters? Missouri&amp;rsquo;s House and Senate Republican leaders are just as clueless and irresponsible about money.
Yes, I said it: the Missouri Republican legislature is about as conservative and principled as Susan Rice on a Sunday talk show.
By going on a votes-for-cash spending spree on the last day of the General Assembly, the House and Senate handed Jay &amp;ldquo;Idiot&amp;rdquo; Nixon a PR prize worth its weight in pork.

                I can be pretty hard on Republicans. Not hard enough for some. Too hard for others.
But I, at least, try to time my battles for ideological consistency. As a general rule, odd-numbered years are for cleaning up the GOP. Even-numbered years are for cleaning out Democrats.
This is an odd-numbered year. Right up to the votes on the continuing resolution,my primary targets were Republicans, especially Roy Blunt.
Once the House exercised its Constitutional power of the purse strings, sending a popular continuing resolution to the Senate, the battle lines shifted.

                Lowell Weicker was a RINO. So was Lincoln Chaffe for a while. And John Linsday, the mayor who tried to destroy New York City in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
RINO stands for &amp;ldquo;Republican In Name Only.&amp;rdquo; Rhinos and Elephants are both pachyderms, so it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty clever name for people who join the Republican Party but prefer the Democrat platform.
The problem is, some people take the concept to extremes.
