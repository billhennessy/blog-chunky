<h3 id="auditor-schweichs-municipal-courts-project">Auditor Schweich&rsquo;s Municipal Courts Project</h3>
<p>In November, <a href="https://www.24thstate.com/2014/10/municipal-courts-initiative.html">State Auditor Tom Schweich announced the Municipal Courts Project</a>. The Auditor will audit 10 municipalities suspected of violating state limits on fines from traffic tickets. Missouri law requires cities to forfeit to the state revenues from traffic tickets that exceed 30 percent of total revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2R2d0B7liI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2R2d0B7liI</a></p>
<p>The law does not prevent cities from enforcing traffic laws for safety. The intends to limit financial incentives for cities to write lots of tickets. I had the honor to stand with Republicans&ndash;Auditor Schweich and St. Charles County Executive Steve Ehlmann&ndash;and Democrats&ndash;State Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal and State Rep Scott Sifton&ndash;as Auditor Schweich announced the project.</p>
<h3 id="senator-schmitt-steps-up">Senator Schmitt Steps Up</h3>
<p>Today, I had the pleasure to meet with <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-state-senators-seek-municipal-court-changes/article_491e35f5-5c71-5e76-a84a-0a84ed85e2f4.html">State Senator Eric Schmitt to learn about his efforts to further crack down on the courts.</a> <img src="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/eric_schmitt-300x200.jpg" alt="Eric Schmitt">
Senator Schmitt has pre-filed legislation for the next general assembly that would reduce the traffic revenue limit to 10 percent from 30 percent. Senator Schmitt and I discussed further legislation, such as:</p>
<p>** additional penalties for city official who knowingly fail to forfeit excess funds
** requiring that municipal courts be open to the public
** prohibiting cities from barring families and children from municipal courts
** prohibiting cities form locking out defendants before their case is called
** forcing cities to include all fines, fees, and warrants to the ticket revenue
** limiting cities&rsquo; power to jail people over non-criminal traffic violations (with exceptions for flagrant violations of the court system)</p>
<p>I also recommended as witnesses several people who contacted me about their experiences with municipal courts. And I learned that friend of liberty, <a href="https://www.paulcurtman.com/">State Rep. Paul Curtman</a>, will handle the bill in the House.</p>
<h3 id="action">Action</h3>
<p>Please write your State Representative and State Senator to let them know you support Senator Schmitt&rsquo;s municipal courts reform. He expects strong opposition from the Municipal League&ndash;sort of union for city managers and consultants. This being a bipartisan issue with a strong liberty theme, opponents risk marginalizing themselves.</p>
<p>And say &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; to Tom Schweich (<a href="mailto:moaudit@auditor.mo.gov">moaudit@auditor.mo.gov</a>) and Eric Schmitt(<a href="mailto:eschmitt@senate.mo.gov">eschmitt@senate.mo.gov</a>) for stepping up on behalf of people who need a voice in government.</p>

                Nixon buck-passed while Ferguson burned. With the city’s main business district laid to rubble, buycotts won’t have much effect. And Christmas is around the corner.
Who got hurt last night?
*1. People who own businesses *2. People who work at businesses *3. People who rely on businesses
Time is short. The people affected by last night’s riots need help rebuilding and jobs right now. While I don’t have complete plans, I can throw out eight ideas.

I am embarrassed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about this problem sooner. Or I heard about it and ignored it, which is even worse. Maybe I thought it was just the usual liberal whining about trumped up racial problems. Whatever, I should have listened.

                Guest post by Lee A. Presser
On Wednesday, April 16, 2003, I was in Bel-Ridge, Missouri, Municipal Court to plead “not guilty.” The violation listed on the ticket did not match the reality of what actually happened on the road. In a file folder, I had documents and photographs to rebut the charge. The ticket stated that Court convened at 6:30 P.M. I arrived twenty minutes early.
Before 9:30 that evening, I had been tightly handcuffed twice, verbally abused by police, pushed into a depressing detention cell, and made an example of in front of seventy-five to one hundred people.
