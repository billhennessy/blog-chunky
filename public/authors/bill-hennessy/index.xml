      <description>St. Paul warned us of times like these.
Ephesians 6:10-20 warns us that we lack the strength, wisdom, courage, and intellect to fight the forces of darkness alone. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t fight or that we should leave it to others. It means the only weapons that work are spiritual.
Mere humans cannot forever defend monuments against other humans bent on their destruction. The defilers and destroyers need to get it right only once, while the defenders&amp;rsquo; vigilance must be perfect at all times.</description>

      <title>Why We Prayed at the Statue of St. Louis IX, King of France</title>

      <description>Our purpose in holding this Rosary event at the statue of St. Louis was to satisfy the two greatest commandments: to love God and to love our neighbor as ourselves. To that end, we prayed equally for everyone present at the event:
 For those who attacked us and called us names For those who falsely accused us of being in the KKK For those on both sides of the issues who came to provoke the other side For those police officers who donned riot gear on a hot, humid day to keep us all safe For those who came out to pray  For all of them, we prayed to God that He softens our hearts and fills our souls with gifts of the Holy Spirit.</description>

      <title>The New Confederate Army</title>

      <description>Five hundred West Point Military Academy graduates became the ideological heirs of Robert E. Lee this week. I bet they didn&amp;rsquo;t even realize it. The Gateway Pundit reports that 500 former West Point grads denounce &amp;ldquo;politicization&amp;rdquo; of the military and refuse to defend America against domestic enemies.
Oath of Commissioned Officers  I [state your name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter.</description>

      <description>(Previously, on Civil War&amp;hellip;)
Amanda Mateo&amp;rsquo;s door did indeed have balloons on it. A big plastic wreath with fake balloons. As if Martha Stewart went to work for Fischer-Price.
&amp;ldquo;Hello, again,&amp;rdquo; Amanda said as she opened the door.
&amp;ldquo;How did you know it was safe to open the door?&amp;rdquo; Mike asked.
&amp;ldquo;I looked through the hole, silly. I&amp;rsquo;m not stupid.&amp;rdquo;
Amanda stepped back, and Mike walked into her apartment. Brand new everything.</description>
