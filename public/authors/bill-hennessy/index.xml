      <description>Nate Silver let the cat out of the bag.
In case you don&amp;rsquo;t recognize his name, Nate Silver is the data analyst who launched Five Thirty-Eight, orignally in the New York Times. He was famous for not predicting an election a few years ago.
Today, Nate unloaded on the media for just one aspect of their narrative-driven Coronavirus coverage. In short, noted the same thing Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View pointed out a month ago: positive tests is meaningless unless it&amp;rsquo;s indexed to the number of tests administered.</description>

      <title>Trump Triumphant</title>

      <description>Donald Trump just had another one of those weeks for which he&amp;rsquo;s become famous.
 There was the week hit bombed Syria while dining with President Xi of China at Mar a Lago. There was Easter Week 2019 when the Mueller Report exonerated and the economy hit new highs. There was the week of the State of the Union Address that included his exoneration in the Senate.  But, this week&amp;rsquo;s outbreak of liberty and its commensurate exposure of Trump&amp;rsquo;s enemies as pure scum is the best so far.</description>

      <title>Did Andrew Cuomo Intentionally Kill the Elderly of New York?</title>

      <description>It would be the most sinister murder plot in US history. Imagine a governor conspiring to thin the population of elderly people, using a pandemic as both cover and weapon.
As unimaginable as it would be, evidence is mounting New York Governor Andrew Cuomo did just that: culled the herd in nursing homes by weaponizing Coronavirus.
Dumped Off With Their Own Body Bags New York Governor Andrew Cuomo implemented an emergency declaration that required nursing homes to accept active Coronavirus patients regardless of their ability to care for or isolate the infected patients.</description>

      <title>Doomsday Doctors Make the Best Case for Opening the Economy</title>

      <description>A lot of doctors seem to derive much pleasure from convincing people that Coronavirus will kill us all very soon. Very soon. These are the Doomsday Doctors. And if they&amp;rsquo;re right, we need to eliminate all behavior restrictions immediately and enjoy our final days.
The latest tactic of the Doomsday Doctors is to report (non-peer reviewed) that the Coronavirus has mutated into a weapons-grade killer that no one can avoid or resist.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing &amp;ldquo;around&amp;rdquo; this topic for weeks, now. But I have to post this today, because Scott Adams scooped me. Tonight on his Coffee with Scott Adams Periscope he exposed the secret I&amp;rsquo;ve been leading up to. No reason to be subtle any longer. So, here we go.
Watch Scott Adams&amp;rsquo; rant. (Begins about 9:30 mark.)
There will be extra cussing tonight. Put the kids to bed. Close your windows and get under the covers.</description>

      <description>The leaked Five Eyes dossier on China&amp;rsquo;s nefarious Coronavirus pandemic provides all the pieces to figure out what happened and why. The dossier doesn&amp;rsquo;t connect the dots for you, but they&amp;rsquo;re now easy to connect. So easy, even I can do it. The story goes something like this.
 China was playing around with dangerous natural microbes in order to prove that it was as good as the USA at studying and neutralizing infectious diseases.</description>

      <description>If you believe science, then you disbelieve 2/3 of science.
In 2017, the BBC reported on a major problem in science in medicine: two-thirds (67%) of all scientific and medical studies cannot be replicated. Via BBC:
 Science is facing a &amp;ldquo;reproducibility crisis&amp;rdquo; where more than two-thirds of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist&amp;rsquo;s experiments, research suggests.
 Two years earlier, in 2015, a major study found the same problem, with nearly the same numbers, involving psychology.</description>

      <description>The only thing more dangerous than a man with unlimited resources is a man with nothing to lose.
Thanks to tyrannical and unlawful restrictions on liberty and commerce by a few governors, mayors, and county executives, 30 million Americans have nothing left to lose except their dignity and freedom.
Millions of American feel threatened by stupid and tyrannical policies that have no basis in science or evidence. Only the will to power drives governors like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer.</description>

      <description>Agents of the FBI plotted to frame and destroy General James Flynn for politic purposes according to handwritten notes released today.
General Flynn, a 30-year Army veteran and 3-star General, pled guilty to false charges in order to protect his family from further harassment by the FBI in 2017.
Now, the law firm that once represented Flynn has release thousands of documents it previously illegally refused to turn over. One of those documents is a handwritten note.</description>

      <description>In the past 48 hours, the World Health Organization has spread misinformation about the Coronavirus intended to keep economies closed for good.
On Saturday, the WHO, through its propaganda tools like the New York Times, Twitter, Facebook, and CNN, released a statement that Coronavirus antibodies offered no protection against catching the disease a second time. This statement was factually wrong, but the media quickly broadcast the false statement.
On Sunday, after an outcry by physicians and researchers, the WHO amended its statement to say &amp;ldquo;there is no evidence&amp;rdquo; that Coronavirus antibodies protect people from the disease.</description>

      <description>Coronavirus could wipe out the open office floor plan as quickly and decisively as it wiped out many corporate bottom lines.
Companies that move to an open office cite two benefits for the design:
  Cost savings by cramming more people into a given amount of space.
  Increased innovation, driven by collaboration.
  But multiple studies show that both assumptions are wrong. Now, Coronavirus has proven that open offices represent a significant public health threat, as well.</description>

      <description>Why would YouTube and Twitter executives attack an innovative biotech company?
Hatred. Pure, unadulterated hate.
Nothing but raging emotion can explain why both YouTube and Twitter went on the offensive against the biotech company AYTU Healight this weekend, banning the company from their platforms.
What AYTU Healight did to earn deplatforming: it found favor with the man the China-controlled World Health Organization hates.
Donald Trump merely asked his mecical experts about the possibilities of AYTU Healight&amp;rsquo;s Far-UVC catheter technology.</description>

      <description>The Congressional Budget Office release a report yesterday (April 24, 2020) that expects our response to Coronavirus will wipe out 40 percent of the US economy and throw 27 million Americans into long-term unemployment. We could see unemployment rates of 20 percent or more for a decade.

      <description>An expert is someone who can&amp;rsquo;t be fired for being wrong about everything 100 percent of the time.
You can call that Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s Law, and Coronavirus is proving this law iron clad. Iron clad.
The latest confirmation of Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s Law just completed.
In March, Donald Trump and others said that warm weather would diminish the spread of Coronavirus, just as it diminishes the flu. The reason: virus that survive well in cool, dry conditions don&amp;rsquo;t do well in warm, humid conditions.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all been seeing the woeful headlines from the media that hates Trump and hates America: CNN, NYTimes, Washington Post, Drudge Report, etc. The headlines combine and conspire to send a single, unmistakable message: DESPAIR.
The headlines and stories are clearly intended to make people panic. The media want people to stay locked in their homes, and they want people to demand that government keeps the brave locked in their homes, as well.</description>

      <title>UPDATE: COVID-19 Acceleration Tracker</title>

      <guid>https://hennessysview.com/post/2020/covid-19-acceleration-tracker/</guid>
      <description>This is a live view of the most important COVID-19 metric: acceleration rates of positive tests, hospitalizations, and deaths.
  Source: The Covid Tracking Project
Key Insight: For every week, Hospitalization rate decreases by about 9.19%.
From My Original Tweet The most important number regarding Coronavirus is a number none of the tracking sites or governments will tell you: acceleration. Lower acceleration of hospitalization and deaths is good. It means the number of new incidents yesterday was smaller than the new incidents from the day before.</description>

      <description>Wearing masks in public will change the way people behave, and the consequences for society could be devastating.
The White House released the plan to Open America Again. It&amp;rsquo;s reasonable, 3-phase plan that relaxes Coronavirus restrictions in 14-day increments. As a state achieves certain metrics, based on CDC surveillance data, it advances to the next phase.
Phases one and two allow increased activity with the recommendation of requiring face masks when in confined public places like work.</description>

Thanks to Josh Schisler and the Reopen Missouri movement, protests are a comin&amp;rsquo;. We&amp;rsquo;re gonna pull good ol&amp;rsquo; fashioned 2009 on a new crop of autocrats in a two-part protest to get Missouri Working Again.

      <description>If you pay attention to certain sources, you&amp;rsquo;ll know exactly what to do. One of these sources is the Francis Vatican. Whatever the Francis Vatican says, do the opposite.
Francis&amp;rsquo; Vatican recently called China the best example of Christianity in the world. Thinking people immediately treated China like the incarnation of Satan, which it is.
When Francis defiled St. Peter&amp;rsquo;s Basilica with demonic idols, thinking Christians canceled their planned trip to the Vatican</description>

      <description>Last week, Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly fired the commanding officer of the USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT. I wrote about it here. I supported that decision, but today I am asking President Trump to fire Thomas Modly.
Modley fired Captain Brett Crozier after Crozier&amp;rsquo;s letter to a wide distribution list appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle. That five-page letter asked the Navy to move 4,000 sailors from the USS Roosevelt to hotels in Guam to be isolated to protect them from Coronavirus, which was spreading on board the aircraft carrier.</description>

      <description>Last week I hoped that the Coronavirus pandemic would kill a few horrible ideas. One of those bad ideas involves bowing down before data models as if they were some sort of pagan god. (I should have added to that list the idea of foundations funded by American billionaires.)
Data models are not science, but most people have no idea what science is, so they fall prey to this insidious myth.</description>

      <description>People like clean storylines with an obvious, likable hero and a sinister, hateable villain.
When real life tells us a story, our minds will mold the facts to fit our desired storylines. In other words, we will create a hero and a villain for every story, even if there aren&amp;rsquo;t any.
As we retell our semi-fictionalized story to ourselves or others, we pad the hero&amp;rsquo;s character and tarnish the villain&amp;rsquo;s with each telling.</description>

      <description>What kind of world will emerge from the coronavirus shutdown?
People have gleefully surrendered amazing new powers to governments. We have erected barriers between ourselves and all other humans on the planet. We have surrendered all of our rights, including the First Amendment. We have abandoned religion. The Catholic Church has ordered its priests to disobey Christ&amp;rsquo;s Great Commission by prohibiting baptisms. We have shut down every business that isn&amp;rsquo;t part of a global enterprise.</description>

      <description>Someone sent me a video. The video shows a doctor explaining how coronavirus is worse than the flu. Should we believe him?
I say, no. And the reasons we should not believe this doctor about the relative dangers of two diseases have nothing to do with medicine. They have everything to do with statistics and lying.
First, the statistics.
The Doctor&amp;rsquo;s Statistical Error The doctor, a general surgeon, opens the video by stating his conclusion that coronavirus is deadlier than influenza and his proof.</description>

      <description>Do We Deserve Freedom?
You probably know people who are concerned about a &amp;ldquo;surveillance state&amp;rdquo; developing. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re one of them. I know I am.
It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable fear.
Some police departments are using drones to spy on people in their homes, peering into living rooms and bedrooms with digital cameras and fining or arresting people who have more than the imposed limit of guests. The justification the state gives for these intrusions is, of course, coronavirus.</description>

      <description>SEATTLE â Left-wing terrorist group Antifa has threatened to sue non-members wearing protective masks in public as a violation of the group&amp;rsquo;s trademark.
&amp;ldquo;Wearing masks in public as a form of intimidation and anonymity is our thing,&amp;rdquo; said Seattle-area organizer Josh Millgram. &amp;ldquo;These fascists are ruining the brand. I mean, look, with everybody out there wearing some sort of mask, we don&amp;rsquo;t even know who to hit.&amp;rdquo;
Antifa Seattle&amp;rsquo;s general counsel and chief operating officer, Heidi Berkhardt, wrote in a statement, &amp;ldquo;by long use and general practice, the Antifa mask has become a trademark for the organization.</description>

      <description>Last week, I pointed out that the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus is a meaningless number. The media is all atwitter about it, but the media are mostly idiots. (Never trust a reporter.)
Bloomberg now cites many &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo; who agree with me on this:
 It doesnât matter that the United States surpassed China this week in reported Covid-19 cases because those numbers (83,507 and 81,782 respectively as of March 26) donât tell us how many people actually became infected in either country.</description>

      <title>7 Bad Ideas That Coronavirus Might Finally Kill</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a silver lining in the coronavirus pandemic, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to look far. Several bad ideas have become institutionalized in America in recent decades. These bad ideas have served the virus well, made it more deadly, and forced us to shut down our economy.
No more!
If we learn anything from this pandemic, these bad ideas will die:
  Open Offices: Millions of people have seen how moves to open office environments kill productivity and destroy previously good companies.</description>

      <description>Newspapers are lying to you. They&amp;rsquo;re feeding you ads pretending it&amp;rsquo;s news.
The headlines are not only false, they&amp;rsquo;re dangerous. And wrong.
The most common such lie goes like this: &amp;ldquo;Best Streaming Service For Shelter in Place&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s What to Binge Watch While Locked Down&amp;rdquo;
Here&amp;rsquo;s the truth: we will not emerge from the coronavirus crisis stronger or better if we spend this time doing what we&amp;rsquo;ve always done.</description>

The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

      <description>When you hear &amp;ldquo;coronavirus&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;COVID-19,&amp;rdquo; you probably think of words like fear, disruption, recession, sick, death, inconvenient, and maybe even China.
What if every time you hear &amp;ldquo;coronavirus,&amp;rdquo; you automatically think &amp;ldquo;gratitude?&amp;rdquo;
How do you feel when you feel grateful?
Most people associate feeling grateful with relief, appreciation, happiness, joy, and safety. Good feelings.
Now, why are you grateful for coronavirus?
That&amp;rsquo;s completely up to you. But I bet you can list just two reasons for being grateful for coronavirus.</description>

      <description>You might have heard mention of the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918 to 1919. Being the great-grandson of a doctor who came out of retirement to assist with St. Louis&amp;rsquo;s response to that epidemic, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d should share a little information about the differences and similarities between the Spanish Flu and coronavirus. I&amp;rsquo;ll briefly cover both the diseases and the responses.
 Note: The word &amp;ldquo;pandemic&amp;rdquo; was unknown in 1918, so contemporaneous references to the disease used the term &amp;ldquo;epidemic.</description>

      <description>Horses are prey to many species. Their behavior, their physiology, is that of a beast under constant threat from, usually, smaller, less beautiful organisms.
Yet, wild horses capture our imaginations. Their grace and beauty, their power, and their gentleness reminds us of what we would be if we lived into our highest ideals for ourselves. We would be worthy of our sufferings.

      <description>If the world has listened to Trump in 2015, the coronavirus pandemic might have happened, but it would have been a lot less severe. I say this with absolutely no fear of error.
President Trump become an enemy of the left for just one policy proposal: controlling national borders. Trump not only wanted to restore US border controls that were left to decay since the 1960s, he also encouraged other nations to treat their borders like the front doors of their homes.</description>

      <description>Several friends tell me we are overreacting to the Coronavirus pandemic. Others say we are too complacent. So, which is it?
When dealing with an epidemic, we need to consider two things:
 Current numbers are not very useful. Effects are non-linear.  Beware Current Numbers The first argument I hear from those who wish we&amp;rsquo;d just go on with life as usual involves current statistics: number of confirmed cases, number of dead, etc.</description>

Senator Martha McSally told Judge Jeanine tonight that the next problem to solve in the coronavirus testing problem is the first mile. We have plenty of labs ready to accept specimens, but getting the specimens from the drive-thru test centers to a drop-off point, say a post office or Fedex drop.
Perhaps people could be enlisted to serve as couriers of these specimens.</description>

      <description>My wife texted me yesterday asking if we should stock up a couple of weeks worth of food and water.
Now, there&amp;rsquo;s really no empirical reason to stock up on food and water. But there is a psychological/economic reason: the Common Knowledge game.
Common Knowledge is something everyone knows everyone knows. When something becomes Common Knowledge, most people will behave as if the &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; were true, if it is not. Stock markets are perfect example of Common Knowledge games.</description>

      <description>Long ago in South St. Louis Mom and Dad would go to an early Mass on Sundays. Maybe 6:30, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. Anyway, it was early. They&amp;rsquo;d bring home donuts from Donut Drive-In on Chippewa.
But between the time they left for Mass and the time they returned with donuts, us kids would get into mischief. As I remember it, my oldest sister, Tee, started it.
Tee would come downstairs, go straight to the ice box, open the freezer, pull out the newish carton of Neapolitan ice cream (&amp;ldquo;newish&amp;rdquo; because Mom and Dad shopped on Thursdays), and stand over the sink eating it with a big spoon straight from the carton.</description>

      <description>They say that time heals all wounds. But some wounds don&amp;rsquo;t heal. They fester and metastasize until pain demands the intervention of a surgeon&amp;rsquo;s scalpel.
Two years have passed since Eric Greitens was carried from the Missouri Governor&amp;rsquo;s Mansion by a toxic cocktail of lies, false allegations, and prosecutorial misconduct.
For two years, Missouri&amp;rsquo;s media and establishment Republicans pretended it never happened. They never liked Greitens, and they wanted him to go away.</description>

      <description>Last week, the Missouri Ethics Commission fined former Governor Eric Greitens for nothing. Literally, they fined him for doing nothing wrong.
Even CNN finds the Missour Ethics Commission unethical and repulsive:
 A Missouri panel &amp;ldquo;found no evidence of any wrongdoing&amp;rdquo; by former Gov. Eric Greitens following a nearly 18-month investigation into allegations of misconduct by his 2016 gubernatorial campaign, according to a report released Thursday (CNN)
 Political pressure from the current Missouri governor undoubtedly weighed on the MEC.</description>

Apparently, the same idiots who built the Obamacare website (aka Harvard) also built a voting app for the caucuses. Like Obamacare, the app didn&amp;rsquo;t work. At least, that&amp;rsquo;s the official story.
But it&amp;rsquo;s never uncharitble to presume the Democrats are cheating. Because Democrats are cheaters by nature and practice.

      <description>What is &amp;ldquo;rent-seeking?&amp;rdquo;
Here&amp;rsquo; a brief description from David John Marotta, What Is Rent-Seeking Behavior in Forbes
 Rent-seeking doesn&amp;rsquo;t add any national value. It is coerced trade and benefits only one side. Rent-seeking can include piracy, lobbying the government or even just giving away money.
 There are two kinds of lobbyists.
One kind of lobbyist is necessary to keep legislators and executive-branch bureaucrats informed and on notice. These lobbyists protect the interests of special interest group, but often their special interest needs protection because it is at the mercy of the government.</description>

Sometimes I think Pontius Pilate gets a bad rap.
Sure, he was ultimately the slithery politician who sentenced Jesus to death, but he was also the only person on earth who offered Jesus something of a defense.
When the Jews first presented Jesus to Pilate, Pilate told them to try Jesus themselves. But the Jews argued that they could not lawfully put Him to death (John 18:31).</description>

Jerry Garcia of Grateful Dead was famous for saying &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s about the journey, not the destination.&amp;rdquo;
Garcia was wrong.
There are two possible destinations:
 Eternal perfection. Eternal misery.  It&amp;rsquo;s all about the destination. The destination is all that matters.
The journey matters only insofar as it determines the destination. If you know and pursue the right destination, the journey will be difficult, often painful, often lonely, often frustrating.</description>

      <description>A Frenchman named Michel Chiron was possessed by demons for decades. His story of exorcism revealed something remarkable.
In an interview with SolÃ¨ne TadiÃ© for National Catholic Register, Chiron said the demons possessing him mocked Jesus but feared &amp;ldquo;The Woman.&amp;rdquo;
About Jesus:
 They told me he did exist in the past but that he should be forgotten, as nowadays human beings no longer needed him. They even said that he was with their king now.</description>

      <description>This post is about impeachment. But, first, you need to hear about a toy bird from the 1970s.
Disappointing Toys When I was seven or eight, I just had to have a Zorr: The Mighty Eagle.
Zorr could soar on the wind for hours, just like a real eagle. The TV commercials left me certain that Zorr would make the most popular kid on my blockâmaybe the whole parish. I&amp;rsquo;d have a pet eagle, really.</description>

      <description>IG Report: Obama Out-Dicked Nixon
Nixon resigned. He resigned after a half-dozen Republican Senators told him, in the Oval Office, that a majority of Senators would vote to remove him from office if the House impeached him.
So Nixon resigned.
Nixon&amp;rsquo;s crimes were limited to covering up a break-in and wiretapping by employees of his re-election committee.
Baraka Obama did worse. And he got by.
Obama out-dicked Nixon.
The IG Report Department of Justice Inspector-General Michael Horowitz released his report on Monday.</description>

(This will be very short.)
The conservative tide continues. People around the world are fed up with the failed ideas of the 1960s and 1970s. Maybe it was nostalgia that drove world leaders to dig up all the political crap I remember from my childhood. It failed then, and it&amp;rsquo;s failing us now.</description>

      <description>If Democrats cross the Rubicon by impeaching President Trump, they will be sending a strong signal: no Republican president will ever survive his first term.
How do you expect people to respond? I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the people President Obama derisively labeled &amp;ldquo;bitter clingers.&amp;rdquo;
  The people RealPolitics data analyst Sean Trende identified as &amp;ldquo;downscale, Northern, rural &amp;hellip; H. Ross Perot voters.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>You can deplatform Twitter and damage their business model. You don&amp;rsquo;t need money or special skills or lawyers. But deplatforming Twitter requires two things:
 Commitment. Friends.  Friends can be strangers, as long as they use Twitter. Twitter followers are perfect friends for this action.
What Is &amp;ldquo;Deplatforming&amp;rdquo; and Why Should We Do It? Deplatforming is one of these new words that irritate me. But new words have the virtue of universality.</description>

 My Protestant friends were angry at the goings on at the Amazon Synod.
It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for some Protestants to disagree with the Catholic Church. After all, that&amp;rsquo;s what makes them &amp;ldquo;protestants.&amp;rdquo; What is unusual is why the Protestants are upset at the Church.</description>

      <description>Call me &amp;ldquo;rigid.&amp;rdquo;
Last night, I saw a tweet that broke my heart.
A woman wrote that her husband told her he was going to Mass after work. But he went to a bar, instead. She went to the bar. He was there. He was drunk.
She asked for our prayers.
I said one for her, and two for her husband.
The woman is a traditional Catholic, like me. Or what the Holy Father calls &amp;ldquo;rigid.</description>

      <description>Rosary Coast-to-Coast at the Arch in St. Louis We are in a spiritual battle for America&amp;rsquo;s soul, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been fighting it all wrong.

      <guid>https://hennessysview.com/post/2019/rigid-vs-squishy/</guid>
      <description>The opposites of &amp;ldquo;rigid&amp;rdquo; are more unflattering than rigidity:
 lenient indulgent broken compromising easy imprecise indefinite inexact irresolute unfixed unreliable accommodating liberal permissive resigned soft-hearted
 And that&amp;rsquo;s the problem with name-calling. When we impose a derogatory label on someone, we invite scrutiny upon ourselves. We label ourselves as the opposite of the names we impose on others.
Some of us are better at name-calling, or &amp;ldquo;labelling,&amp;rdquo; than others. Donald Trump does a lot of labeling.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll write that again so no one&amp;rsquo;s confused: all problems, including all political problems, are demonic. Stop inviting Satan and the demons out of the abyss God made for them, and problems go away.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to write a book called How to Lose Friends and Alienate People. But nobody reads autobiographies anymore. So I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you how to be unpopular, instead.
Being unpopular is pretty easy. And it&amp;rsquo;s hard, too. It&amp;rsquo;s easy because there&amp;rsquo;s only one rule, which we&amp;rsquo;ll get to in a moment. It&amp;rsquo;s hard for two reasons: beforehand, it&amp;rsquo;s scary to think about following the rule. Afterwards, it&amp;rsquo;s lonely and painful to have followed the rule.</description>

I wish, though, his excellency had addressed the real cause of Catholics losing their faith: the ugly and sacrilegious farce that is the Novus Ordo (or Ordinary Form) Mass.
Here&amp;rsquo;s Bishop Barron&amp;rsquo;s initial tweet. I urge you to watch the video attached.</description>

Now, imagine it&amp;rsquo;s the first time you&amp;rsquo;ve ever done this.
That&amp;rsquo;s how John Braddock begins his third book, A Spy&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Taking Risks. With the story of his first mission as an alias.
In his previous books, A Spy&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Thinking and A Spy&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Strategy, Braddock, a retired CIA Field Officer, provided readers with top-notch spy stories and top-shelf tools for success.</description>

This time, the left&amp;rsquo;s insanity arises from the final report of the special investigator, Robert Mueller, into alleged crimes committed by the presidential campaign of Donald Trump in 2015 and 2016.
Amazingly, what we are seeing in the reaction to that Mueller report was seen by an early father of the Church, St.</description>

      <description>I prefer the Latin Mass of 1962 (and a thousand years before) for at least 12 reasons listed here. My last reason for loving the Latin Mass (which I failed to list in that blog post) seems important: how American Catholicism has changed since the inception of the new mass in about 1970. So I turned to Georgetown University&amp;rsquo;s Center for Applied Research in the Apostalate for the numbers.
Catholicism is dying in the United States.</description>

Not because of anything that happened to her. She didn&amp;rsquo;t lose her home. No one close to her died because of the election.
Chelsea Handler lost her mind because reality violated her expectations.

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to Latin Mass instead of the new mass. Latin Mass feels like home to me. It feels like a call to holiness. Every detail of the Latin Mass has meaning, not just to me, but to everyone who&amp;rsquo;s studied scripture. The words, the gestures, the artifacts like the communion rail all have deep meaning. I don&amp;rsquo;t think the new mass is heretical; I just don&amp;rsquo;t think it lifts us up toward God.</description>

      <description>Just a quick warning. On break from Lenten retreat, but this is bugging me.
Many conservatives are celebrating the Mueller report even though they have no idea what it says.
That&amp;rsquo;s dangerous, as I pointed out in my post on loving Rachel Maddow:
 Finally, we still donât know the details of the Mueller report. It could contain information that sends conservatives to Twitter to express our rage and anger. We donât know.</description>

      <description>God gives us so many opportunities to love our enemies. How often do we take him up on those offers?
One of those opportunities to love came to us yesterday. Independent counsel Robert Mueller delivered to the Attorney General his final report on potential crimes involving the 2016 presidential election and the Trump campaign.
The lede of that story was this: no new indictments.
And the left lost their minds.</description>

      <description>Tina Turner not withstanding, love is not an emotion, and that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing.
In today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel (from the modern lectionary), Jesus tells his disciples to &amp;ldquo;love your enemies&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;pray for those who persecute you.&amp;rdquo;
But how? I find it difficult even to be around certain people, much less love them. Surely, Jesus wasn&amp;rsquo;t serious when He told us to love our enemies, right? If Jesus meant what He said, then I must not know what love means.</description>

      <description>Down in the world&amp;rsquo;s newest socialist &amp;ldquo;paradise,&amp;rdquo; the longest blackout in decades has struck Venezuela. The country has been without power for at least 4 days. That&amp;rsquo;s how socialism works.
The constitutional president, Juan Guaido, has called on Venezuelans to pour into the capital city of Caracas to demand the communist dictator Madura surrender. Guaido correctly points out that Maduro&amp;rsquo;s socialism caused the problem.
Guaido&amp;rsquo;s call is great, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go far enough.</description>

      <title>Fasting Is a Good Spring Cleaning for the Soul</title>

      <description>My heart and soul needed a good spring cleaning, and Lent arrived just in time.
Lent is fasting season. Most people know what fasting is, but many people don&amp;rsquo;t know what religious fasting is for. What good does fasting do the soul?
Fasting is form of asceticism. That means intentionally depriving yourself of some comfort or sensual pleasure. Asceticism does not require pain or self-flagellation. Self-flagellation tends to lead to pride and should be avoided.</description>

      <description>In a blog I never published for fear of being thought insane, I conveyed a prophecy:
 Many Christians will be accused of crimes against the state for simply following Christ&amp;rsquo;s teachings and believing that Jesus is our lord and savior. When you are accused and at trial, the Holy Spirit will speak through you if you let Him. You won&amp;rsquo;t need to come up with your own defense. Anyone might betray you and cause you to be put to death, even your parents or your children.</description>

      <description>I have never looked forward to the start of Lent.
Lent is a time of repentance and atonement in anticipation of the commemoration of the passion, death, and resurrection of Christ Jesus. The whole idea of repentance and atonement always bothered me.
Until now.
This year, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for Lent to begin.
First, I&amp;rsquo;ve been called to redirect my zeal away from politics and toward God. Instead of bringing people into communion with the Constitution and liberty, I&amp;rsquo;m asked to bring people to Christ and Christ to people.</description>

Snowstorm Humanitarian Crisis on I-44 Last night, hundreds of people (maybe thousands) were trapped in their cars on I-44 eastbound near Eureka, Missouri for 7, 9, 12 hours. Some even longer. According to police scanners, a baby was born on the highway. It was a humanitarian crisis.
Now, St. Louis billionaire Rex Sinquefield wants to make every aspect of your St. Louis County life a humanitarian crisis.</description>

      <description>You might have read the post A Fourth Turning Warning. If you did, you&amp;rsquo;re probably wondering if I&amp;rsquo;ve lost mind. If you conclude I have not lost my mind, you probably wonder why I&amp;rsquo;d run from the fight. So I should probably address that.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start, as we should always, with the Word. In this case, the Book of Matthew 5:43-45:
 &amp;ldquo;You have heard that is was said, &amp;lsquo;You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.</description>

(Read We Have the War Upon Us by William J. Cooper)
Today, I have a short warning from the great book The Fourth Turning by Howe and Strauss.
What Should Have Happened after 2016 Strauss and Howe prophesied an election that changed everything sometime during the Crisis era which began with the fall of Lehman Brothers (the last time Nancy Pelosi was Speaker of the House):</description>

      <description>Mitt Romney&amp;rsquo;s naÃ¯vetÃ© is almost cute. He thinks it&amp;rsquo;s still 1982.
But it&amp;rsquo;s not cute because it&amp;rsquo;s destructive. The world has changed, and everything is ready to fall apart.
See, Mitt is mad that President Donald Trump hasn&amp;rsquo;t done more to &amp;ldquo;unite&amp;rdquo; the country. Mittens wants the president to be more &amp;ldquo;unifying.&amp;rdquo;
Because &amp;ldquo;trying&amp;rdquo; to unite the country would solve everything, right?
But the world has changed. Americans today are as polarized as they were 1861.</description>

      <description>Millennials seem to believe anything that comes from the mouth of an &amp;ldquo;expert.&amp;rdquo; Even the older Millennials are probably too green to realize that listening to experts will produce worse results than going with your gut.
It works like this . . . when we go with our gut (or some non-expert&amp;rsquo;s suggestion), we build in a wide margin for error. We recognize the fallibility of our own judgment and proceed with due caution.</description>

      <description>Fasting is probably the healthiest thing you can do for yourself. It&amp;rsquo;s also the cheapest healthy thing you can do. Unlike most diets and exercise plans, supplements, and, especially, trips to a doctor, fasting actually saves money. When you fast, you don&amp;rsquo;t eat.
Further, fasting is the simplest thing you can do to improve your physical and mental health. There are only two things to remember:
 Don&amp;rsquo;t eat. Drink some water.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when I heard it the second time, phrased slightly differenlty: &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t be alive when . . . .&amp;rdquo;
I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what the &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo; was. It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter.</description>

Talking about the possibility of Democrats seizing control of the US House of Representatives, he said, &amp;ldquo;could happen . . . could happen.&amp;rdquo;
But the killer line we all must remember came next: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it.</description>

Democrats use refugees like pawns in their perverted and wicked quest for power.

Most recently, the Obama administration banned all asylum seekers from Cuba.</description>

Are those things really what makes life better? If so, why do so many successful people burn out? John Belushi, River Phoenix, Amy Winehouse, Janice Joplin, Michael Jackson. Is it show business? Well, look what&amp;rsquo;s happening to Elon Musk.</description>

      <description>Amendment 1 would turn over Missouri&amp;rsquo;s state and federal gerrymandering to an unelected demographer. This means there&amp;rsquo;s an 8 to 1 chance (87.5%) that the demographer will be a Democrat.Â Demography is a social science.Â Social science majors are mostly far left or liberal. Only a handful of social science majors call themselves conservative:
 A 2015 study by psychologist JosÃ© Duarte, then at Arizona State University, and his colleagues inÂ Behavioral and Brain Sciences, entitled âPolitical Diversity Will Improve Social Psychological Science,â found that 58 to 66 percent of social scientists are liberal and only 5 to 8 percent conservative and that there are eight Democrats for every Republican.</description>

All these mail bombs I&amp;rsquo;m talking about.Â You have to ask yourself: &amp;ldquo;who would do this two weeks before an election?&amp;rdquo;
If you&amp;rsquo;re a conservative, do you do something that&amp;rsquo;s bound to inspire sympathy for lefties right before an election? No.
Unless you&amp;rsquo;re insane.Â Any sane person would know that a (failed) mail-bomb plot targeting a bunch of Democrats and leftists will only make conservatives look bad.</description>

      <description>I keep hearing the media say terrible things about women who live in suburbs and went to college.Â According to everyone from CNN to the Cook Political Report, these college-educated suburban women have no control over their emotions or their hormones. They self-sabotage and sabotage their families just to quell their own emotional urges.Â In other words, the media say college-educated suburban women are all hysterical.Â That&amp;rsquo;s a terrible, sexist thing for the CNN to say about these women.</description>

      <description>You probably heard that a bunch of witches are gathering in New York City today to put hexes on Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump, and others. Don&amp;rsquo;t take this lightly.Â Father Richard Heilman and folks at the Holy League have asked Christians to pray the Lorica of St. Patrick for Justice Kavanaugh, substituting &amp;ldquo;Brett Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Justice Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; for the first person pronouns.
This is a powerful prayer that&amp;rsquo;s more than 1,500 years old!</description>

      <description>No, it&amp;rsquo;s not more money. Nor better ads. Nor snarkier tweets. Nor more Facebook friends.Â Keeping the US House of Representatives out of the hands of the #AngryDemocratMob requires supernatural help. We cannot do it alone.
The other side has supernatural help. The other side cooperates with Satan for power on earth. Therefore, our battle is not with mere mortals alone, but with demons working in concert with men. Even if we were to assemble a vast army of mere mortals, we will lose.</description>

      <description>In less than two years, Donald J. Trump has already achieved more as President of the United States than most of his predecessors did in eight or more years.Â  Trump has eliminated more federal regulations than all past presidents combined Trump pushed through Congress one of the largest tax cuts in history Trump has renegotiated numerous trade agreements, including NAFTA Trump has reinvigorated American manufacturing Trump has sparked the strongest economy in US history Trump has reduce unemployment for blacks and Hispanics to their lowest levels in history Trump has achieved a remarkable 35% favorability rating among blacks, the highest for a Republican in modern times Trump has placedÂ on the Supreme Court two solidly conservative jurists Trump has given Republicans the courage to stand up to evil progressives Trump has reunited the warring factions of the Republican base Trump has changed Americans&amp;rsquo; expectations of the office of president Trump has redefined what it means to be presidential Trump has exposed America&amp;rsquo;s domestic enemies and left vulnerable  Even those who viscerally hate Donald Trumpâand there are manyâcannot deny that Trump&amp;rsquo;s impact on the USA and on the world exceeds even his impact on the New York City skyline.</description>

      <description>I predicted that Judge Brett Kavanaugh would be rejected by the Senate. I was wrong. In a few minutes from the time I write, the Senate will confirm Judge Kavanaugh by a vote of 50 ayes to 48 nays. One Republican will vote &amp;ldquo;present.&amp;rdquo;
What went wrong?Â I underestimated the courage and fortitude of three Senators: Republicans Jeff Flake and Susan Collins, and Democrat &amp;ldquo;Lonely&amp;rdquo; Joe Manchin.Â I truly believed Flake would put his hatred of Donald Trump before the good of the country and vote nay.</description>

You&amp;rsquo;ve Never Lived in a Time Like This One I&amp;rsquo;m almost old enough to remember the Democrat National Convention of 1968. Almost. What a show.Â Hippies and Yippies marching, tear gas, Mayor Daley, Buckley threatening to punch Gore Vidal on live TV.</description>

A 54-day novena for our nation. It ends on October 7 with the Rosary Coast-to-Coast. Which means it started before I learned of either.Â But that&amp;rsquo;s okay. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to do the novena to do say the Rosary.Â Just show up at any of the Rosary stations around the area at 3:00 on October 7. I&amp;rsquo;m helping organize one location at the Black Madonna Shrine in Eureka/Pacific area.</description>

She will pass the committee about 72 hours after the Senate receives the nomination.</description>

On October 7, Christians around the world will unsheathe the most powerful weapon with which God has ever armed his people.Â We will, together, wage a great battle in the spiritual war of our age.Â What is this weapon? What is the spiritual war?Â If you&amp;rsquo;re paying attention at all, you know the spiritual war we&amp;rsquo;re all in.</description>

They especially hate themselves.Â When you hate yourself, nothing is beneath you.Â When you hate yourself, you debase yourself.Â When you hate yourself, you are capable and willing to do anything.</description>

St. Josemaria Escriva
 On Sunday, October 7 at 3:30 p.m. Central (and simultaneously across the USA and the whole world), millions will say the Rosary in unison. Will you join us?
 We are at war.Â A war without borders, where no man is exempt but where most havenât recognized, let alone been trained, to fight. Casualties often go unseen, but very few are left unwounded.</description>

      <description>Stella Is My Teacher This is probably disturbing to theologians and apologists, but it makes sense to me. When I struggle with how to relate personally to Christ, I think of the way my dog relates to me. And when I wonder how God feels about me, I think about how I feel about my dog.Â Dogs treat their people the way we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to treat God. And we respond to dogs in a way that teaches us how God responds to us.</description>

For many years, I wrote and preached that we owe them contempt and anger. That we must fight them tooth and nail. And that we must prevail.
And we did. And our victories led to bigger battles. The thrill of victory proved fleeting.
Don&amp;rsquo;t you hope for a victory that lasts?</description>

      <description>You might think I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty hard on Pope Francis lately. I&amp;rsquo;ve questioned whether his refusal to deny Archbishop ViganÃ²&amp;rsquo;s accusations. And I&amp;rsquo;ve indicated that, if the allegations are true, the pope&amp;rsquo;s resignation might be the best thing for the Church.
Please understand that my posts are about seeking justice for the many victims of this scandal, includes the many faithful who never directly abused by a priest but, nonetheless, have been harmed by the scandal.</description>

      <description>One week after Archbishop CarloÂ ViganÃ² released his bombshell letter, it looks obvious that Pope Francis admits the key allegation: Francis knew McCarrick to be a serial molester, and he returned McCarrick to public ministry anyway. As we&amp;rsquo;ll see later in this post, Pope Francis has a pattern of letting molesters and their protectors off the hook.

We were discussing my plan to become a Catholic Street Evangelist. My first prayer station event is September 16 under the tutelage of a seasoned team leader.
&amp;ldquo;Why do you say it like that?&amp;rdquo; I asked her.
&amp;ldquo;This is kind of a bad time to be out trying to bring people into the Catholic church, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo;
She had a point.

I&amp;rsquo;m talking about his recent series of letters and clarifications regarding how Catholics should express their obedience to the pope. Jim is partially right and partially off base.
What Jim Towey Gets Right Jim is right that that conservative Catholics need to be very gracious and obedient when they challenge the pope&amp;rsquo;s formal teaching on matters like the death penalty.</description>

      <description>One man can confirm or deny the central allegation against Pope Francis. The Catholic Church needs that man to step up now.
In an 11-page letter by former US Nuncio (ambassador) Archbishop Carlo Maria ViganÃ², Pope Francis is accused of ignoring warnings about Cardinal Timothy McCarrick. ViganÃ² claims he personally delivered the warning to Pope Francis in 2013. The pope allegedly ignored the warning and the dossier on McCarrick in 2013.</description>

 Pope Francis ignored evidence of crimes and overturned punishment imposed by Pope Benedict on the wicked and disgraced Cardinal McCarrick. That&amp;rsquo;s according to a former papal nuncio and corroborated by a former first counselor to the nunciature to the United States speaking on the record. The two men have direct knowledge of the matter.
Pope Francis refused to comment on the allegations that he personally covered up McCarrick&amp;rsquo;s crimes.</description>

      <description>Thousands of religions have sprung up around the world. Most lasted less than a generation. Some lasted longer. Only five have shown the stability and breadth to be called &amp;ldquo;world religions.&amp;rdquo; They are Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam.
The Eastern religionsâBuddhism and Hinduismâcompartmentalize faith from daily life. They protect believers from the risks of a leap of faith. Philosopher Mortimer Adler dismissed Eastern religions because of this &amp;ldquo;logic-tight compartmentalization.&amp;rdquo; Religions that segregate faith from action dismiss believers of the need to take a leap of faith.</description>

Today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel reading comes from John 6. John chapter 6 is all about the bread of life. In it, Jesus shocks his Jewish followers by announcing that they must eat his flesh and drink his blood to achieve eternal life.
When some of his disciples challenged this formula for immortality, Jesus doubled down, saying:
 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Friday, and our archbishop in St. Louis has done a great thing. (Maybe today would be a good time to thank a priest. Give him encouragement.) But the town blog used deception to report the story.
Archbishop Robert Carlson of St. Louis asked Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Attorney General, Josh Hawley, to review all of the archdiocese&amp;rsquo;s records regarding abuse cases. Hawley agreed to the Archbishop&amp;rsquo;s request.
Archbishop Carlson deserves our praise and respect for his openness and honesty.</description>

      <description>I heard a story a long time ago. From a woman who escaped the Soviet Union and came to America.
She told us how lucky we are in America to have priests. She urged us to pray in thanksgiving every day that we have priests.
The communists in Russia outlawed religion. While some religions continued to operate, the government seemed to have a particular hatred of Catholics. Russian communists were familiar with the unique power of priests to consecrate the sacrifice and administer sacraments.</description>

      <description>Because of my sinfulness and selfishness, I was out of communion with the blessed sacrament for most of my adult life. To anyone who&amp;rsquo;s never been excommunicated, you cannot imagine the pain and humiliation of being in that state.
Being a coward, I avoided mass. I was too embarrassed. Week after week, my neighbors would see me not going to communion. I&amp;rsquo;d have to get up and let the communicants through, then kneel back down, often alone.</description>

      <description>Another day, another 300 accused predatory priests. When will it end, Lord? When will it end?
This morning, I tried to listen in silence for God&amp;rsquo;s answers to my questions.
What do we say about the news out of Pennsylvania? How do we answer those who taunt and ridicule the Church? How do we settle our anger at the priests and bishops and cardinals who protected the pederasts for decades? How do we reconcile the hideous criminality of those men with the uncountable graces God freely gave them through the many sacraments they&amp;rsquo;ve received?</description>

      <description>A great colleague and I invented something in 2010. It was a two-day workshop for companies. It has been incredibly successful.
In that workshop, we cite a lot of behavioral science research. We also point out that some behavioral science research is bogus. Up to 60 percent by a recent study (which might have been bogus itself.) So how do you know good science from bad?
Look for consistency. I&amp;rsquo;ll give you an example.</description>

Yesterday, a colleague asked if she could speak to me. I naturally thought I had done something wrong.
When she began by saying, &amp;ldquo;you know, I always speak my mind,&amp;rdquo; I thought, &amp;ldquo;oh, no. Here it comes.&amp;rdquo;
Then she told me, &amp;ldquo;the other day in a meeting I mentioned how much I love hearing you speak.</description>

      <description>God made man and woman, and man and woman screwed everything up. So, eventually, God gave up the comforts of heaven and most of the perks of being God to become a man on earth and show us how to do it right. Instead of thanking Him for the tutoring, we ridiculed, tortured, and murdered Him.
Lucky for us, a few guys took notes while Jesus was here. And they published them.</description>

      <description>Last week, Pope Francis approved a change to the Catechism of the Catholic Church.
Longtime readers might recall that my views on the death penalty are a bit nuanced. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t always have the courage to express it.
In 2014, I wrote:
 I donât buy the idea that the death penalty is no deterrent. I donât buy the notionÂ that the death penalty should be banned. I think the availabilityÂ of such a punishment serves its purpose.</description>

      <description>Happiness Did you know that the word &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;blessed?&amp;rdquo;
Neither did I. But when I heard this on EWTN Radio the other day, I remembered there are two translations of the Beatitudes. One version goes with &amp;ldquo;Blessed are . . .&amp;rdquo; and the other with &amp;ldquo;Happy are . . . .&amp;rdquo; So, I guess it&amp;rsquo;s true. The words are interchangeable.
Happiness, then, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean walking around in some lithium-induced state of bliss.</description>

      <description>Dottie Bailey defeated Rockwood School Board President Matt Doell in the Republican primary for Missouri House District 110. Dottie now faces Democrat Cody Kelley in November.
Dottie is a phenomenal campaigner. She knocked on over 4,000 doors between April and August. Her efforts resulted in an enormous 19 percentage-point win despite being outspent by her opponent. Making Dottie&amp;rsquo;s more impressive is the fact that Doell had been elected to the Rockwood board three times while this was Dottie&amp;rsquo;s first race ever.</description>

      <description>Personally, I like Jeff Roe, the political consultant.
He called me the night before Ted Cruz announced his run for president. I was honored, frankly. As Senator Cruz&amp;rsquo;s campaign manager, Mr. Roe had much bigger fish to fry that night. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that Jeff holds no grudges. He genuinely cares about the opposing candidates even while he viciously destroys their careers. I have no doubt Mr. Roe has many great qualities as a person, and I know he has amazing talents as aÂ political operative and strategist.</description>

Voters in House District 110 are asking why they received such a &amp;ldquo;disgusting&amp;rdquo; flyer from candidate Matt Doell.
Answer: Probably because he&amp;rsquo;s losing badly.
Matt Doell has decided to get dirty. And personal. And mean. (Horrible internals?)
While Dottie Bailey has knocked doors, attended coffees, and generally met with voters, Matt Doell rubbed elbows with hot-shots and union bosses and avoided anything that looks like an &amp;ldquo;ordinary person.</description>

But the MEC shot Doell down like a hovering duck.
From the MEC&amp;rsquo;s official &amp;ldquo;Wah-wah&amp;rdquo; letter to the Doell campaign:
 Therefore, the Commission is not accepting this complaint.
 Doell&amp;rsquo;s failed complaint centers on my blog posts that criticize his performance as a member of the Rockwood School Board. For your convenience, here&amp;rsquo;s the list of my blogs criticizing Rockwood during Doell&amp;rsquo;s seven-year tenure:</description>

** $1.2 million wasted in double payments ** Contracts awarded to a construction company that had one of its executives on the board ** Feeble, &amp;ldquo;arrogant&amp;rdquo; response to the audit from board members ** Bad management!
But the worst example of cronyism and arrogance went largely unreported. (The great Elliott Davis caught it, though. Video to follow.)

      <description>Many years ago, a company hired a new president.
After several months on the job, this new president learned that most of his employees couldn&amp;rsquo;t pick him out of a line-up. He spent so much time in his office or in meetings or traveling that he rarely met with the people who reported to him.
To fix this problem, he set up a series of lunches. They were off-site at restaurants around town.</description>

      <description>One of the candidates for Missouri House District 110 (Eureka, Wildwood, and Pacific) sent out a mailer to voters today.Â The mailer talks about &amp;ldquo;local control&amp;rdquo; of education, and many other fine platitudes that poll well.Â In other news,** while this candidate was on the Rockwood School District board of directors** (the district that serves most of Eureka, Wildwood, and Pacific), **bad things happened**. Like this:
 The Rockwood School District overpaid its longtime construction management company by more than $1.</description>

      <title>Primary Fasting</title>

      <description>I invite you to join a centuries-old tradition: fasting for a cause.Â Moses and Jesus fasted for 40 days. But this Primary Fast will last only 14.Â Some fasts require that you eat nothing during the fast. But this Primary Fast lets you eat one full, wonderful meal a day. Did you know that General Stanley McChrystal has lived on just one meal a day for decades. And one meal a day was enough to drive him through the war against al Qaeda.</description>

      <title>Quick Math Facts on Rockwood School District Tax History. UPDATE: RDS Servers Bouncing?</title>

      <description>One of the candidates running for the state House of Representatives in District 110 has been on the Rockwood School Board since 2011.Â In a campaign mailer, this candidate claims he&amp;rsquo;s cut taxes in the district. Is that true?
Well, it&amp;rsquo;s true that the property tax rate in Rockwood has been reduced twice during his tenure. But that&amp;rsquo;s not even close to the whole picture.Â Since the 2010-2011 school year, when this candidate joined the board, Rockwood has raised taxes 5 times.</description>

      <description>Some people complain about politicians not representing their constituents well.Â I disagree.Â From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my life, all politicians do a great job of representing their constituents. They really do.
If I&amp;rsquo;m right about politicians being 100% true to their constituents, then why are so many voters so unhappy with the people they voted for?Â It&amp;rsquo;s simple: the voters aren&amp;rsquo;t every politician&amp;rsquo;s constituents.Â That&amp;rsquo;s right. Not all politicians consider the people who vote for them constituents.</description>

      <description>The American Revolution started in a tavern.
Actually, it started in many taverns. But taverns they were.
J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis hatched their greatest novels in The Eagle and Child tavern in Oxford.
If you want to be as great as the founding fathers or as prolific as Tolkien and Lewis, get off social media and get to a bar. I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you why.
#1: Social Media Breed Depression and Anxiety The more time you spend on Facebook, the more likely you are to suffer depression, attempt suicide, and feel overwhelmed by life.</description>

The academics and planners are killing us.Â I just looked at a list of 286 quotes about fathers. It is a modern list. For every positive quote about fathers, the list contains eight negative quotes.</description>

For those of us who believe in limited government that doesn&amp;rsquo;t put its thumb on the scale of achievement, it&amp;rsquo;s time to panic and despair, right?
Wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s never time to panic or despair. And we know this from two of the greatest philosophers of all time, Epictetus and Seneca.</description>

The other celebrates the day about a week later when, having learned of their civil nuptials, my grandfather ordered them to go see Father English and set themselves right with the church.
Like father, like son, I guess. Except, the kid&amp;rsquo;s a lot slower. Fifteen years slower.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time.Â Powerful and corrupt people want to undo the 2016 election. In Washington. In Missouri.
Win or lose, Americans deal with the results of elections. Our commitment to open, public government, of the people, by, the people, for people, has sustained this nation. And made it the greatest nation in the history of humanity.
But dark forces in Missouri want to turn your government into their private club. A club managed by corrupt business who rely on tax dollars to keep their failed enterprises afloat.</description>

back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
but all he kept talking about was Glory Days

&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s this Faughn guy&amp;rsquo;s role in the Greitens&amp;rsquo; investigation?&amp;rdquo; someone asked.
Faughn is the publisher of Missouri Times and a former mayor of Poplar Bluff, Missouri. Papers call him a &amp;ldquo;power broker.&amp;rdquo; Others call him the &amp;ldquo;Candy Man.&amp;rdquo;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the question. &amp;ldquo;Not sure,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;His paper hates Grietens, but that&amp;rsquo;s as much as know. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been to his weird, hidden party pad in Jefferson City.</description>

      <description>âThe [Johnson] Treatmentâ could last anywhere from ten minutes or four hours and it would come whenever and wherever Johnson might find a fellow Senator or politician within his radius.Â âIts tone could be and included supplication, accusation, cajolery, exuberance, scorn, tears, complaint and the hint of threat.â All of these elements together brought out the spectrum of human emotions. Its velocity was breathtaking, and it was all in one direction.</description>

Now, there&amp;rsquo;s a battle for that seat. A battle between a left-leaning Establishment Republican and a grassroots Conservative activist. An activist whose work for the right causes earned a star on Heritage Action&amp;rsquo;s Wall of Honor.</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t tolerate intolerance. Don&amp;rsquo;t curb your tongue. And don&amp;rsquo;t elect whimps to government.Â Missouri&amp;rsquo;s legislature needs every person with spine it find.
You don&amp;rsquo;t want a mouse in the House.

When I read about Schaff&amp;rsquo;s latest endorxementÂ of the Clean Missouri petition initiative, I believed the stories. This is dangerous stuff. If Clean Missouri becomes law, State Senator Rob Schaff&amp;rsquo;s proposal would flip our state legislature from Republican Red to a deep and dirtyÂ Democrat Blue.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve thought it before and been disappointed. But this time is different, right? This time, we have that up-and-coming Attorney General who&amp;rsquo;s backed by conservatives and establishment Republicans alike. A guy equally at home at a Tea Party conference or a Jack Danforth backyard barbecue. This time, for sure.
But this time looks like another disappointment for Missouri Republicans hoping to send another Republican to the US Senate.</description>

People ask me if I&amp;rsquo;m sorry I supported him. Are you kidding?
Governor Greitens signed Right to Work. Something I&amp;rsquo;ve supported since it first appeared in the 1970s.
Governor Greitens strengthened Missouri&amp;rsquo;s strong Right to Life policies.
Governor Greitens is rebuilding Missouri jobs and wages.
Governor Greitens is doing exactly what we elected him to do for Missouri.

      <description>You probably would like to know how to spot a very stable genius. It&amp;rsquo;s a skill that can come in handy. (Free Bonus:Â I&amp;rsquo;ll point you to the funniest thing I ever read in my life. Just because I like you. But first . .Â .)
Well, today, Donald J. Trump gave us a lesson in genius detection.
With the MSM chanting &amp;ldquo;mentally unfit&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;stupid,&amp;rdquo; our very stable genius president took to his favorite persuasion tool, Twitter.</description>

Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve answered, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the limits of data science in 2018.
The best data scientists in the world agreed with nearly absolute certainty. These scientists determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hillary Clinton would be the 45th President of the United States. That was in 2016.

It&amp;rsquo;s not his money or his business experience. Those are strengths, sure, but they&amp;rsquo;re not THE strength.
Scott Adams believes Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign was a movie script. Here&amp;rsquo;s what Adams wrote way, way back when Trump&amp;rsquo;s candidacy was still just a PR stunt because he had zero chance of winning even a single primary:
 A movie script is almost always arranged in what the professionals call a three-act form.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering how things will change in 2018, you might think back the mid-1980s.
In the 1980s, leftist professors, leftist news media, and leftist entertainers were angry. For years, they&amp;rsquo;d preached that Ronald Reagan was a neo-Nazi buffoon whose incompetence and malice would destroy America. Maybe even wipe out the human species. &amp;ldquo;I believe Ronald Reagan can turn America back into what it once was,&amp;rdquo; said comedian Steve Martin on Saturday Night Live in 1980, &amp;ldquo;a vast wasteland covered with ice.</description>

Read the original blog here.
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s look back at the New York City de Blasio inherited. According to ZeroHedge blog:
 Â New York crime rates are at historic lows, the $72.7 billion budget is balanced, jobs are at an all-time high and a record 54 million tourists pumped money into the economy this year.</description>

      <description>Forgive me. I say &amp;ldquo;liberal&amp;rdquo; sometimes when I mean something else.
My mistake is habit, not irony. (Irony would require some intent on my part.)
I grew up disparaging liberalism. I grew up reading and watching William F. Buckley Jr., for whom liberalism was the enemy.
In the post-WWII era, the liberalism of the day was a problem. But it was neverÂ the problem.
The problem in Western Civilization was a faction that used liberalism as cover.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I predicted the NFL would suffer a season-shortening labor dispute this season or next.
The reason: President Trump&amp;rsquo;s pressure on owners to crack down on anthem haters will stir up a fight between NFL Players Association and the owners.
As if on cue:

As the NFL self-destructs, it&amp;rsquo;s worth reading about Jack Kemp&amp;rsquo;s work for civil rights. And for the Republican Party. And for conservatism.

      <description>Coming to a head.
President Trump seems pathologically opposed to festering problems. When he sees a festering problem, he pops it like a zit. For example, the North Korean nukes problem has festered since the Clinton administration. Trump is bringing Little Rocket Man to a head.
NAFTA has been festering since the Clinton administration. Trump is bringing NAFTA to a head.
The latest example: the NFL anthem-haters.
This anthem-hating is over a year old.</description>

You know that Alejandro Villanueva&amp;rsquo;s jersey and t-shirt immediately became the best-selling merchandise from the NFL&amp;rsquo;s store.
Villanueva served three tours of combat duty as an Army Ranger. He&amp;rsquo;s authorized to wear the Bronze Star. He stood for his country. In Afghanistan with the Army and in Pittsburgh alone.</description>

99 out of every 100 football players have serious brain damage.
Kneeling for CTE NFL players and owners decided to show their disrespect to the flag, law enforcement, and the USA by kneeling during the national anthem. In a foreign country.
The president responded by saying the NFL (and the TV networks) would be in big trouble if people stopped watching or attending games.</description>

Everyone sees the symptoms of football&amp;rsquo;s death spiral: empty stadiums. Crashed ratings. low quality. Criminals on the field. Some people call it &amp;ldquo;the National Felony League.&amp;rdquo;
Frustrated fans lookÂ for better entertainment. Ticket sales remain high for one reason: stupid corporate executives. Stupid executives think it&amp;rsquo;s still a status symbol to control lots of NFL tickets.</description>

I felt like the lone voice on the right last week when I wrote &amp;ldquo;Counseling Sessions.&amp;rdquo; It feels great to have Greg Jarrett agree: Jeff Sessions should resign.
As Jarrett puts it:
 Sessions appears either incapable or incompetent.Â He has resisted producing the documents relevant to the anti-Trump dossier which were subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee.Â He has failed to appoint a special counsel to reopen the case against Hillary Clinton for likely violations of the Espionage Act in the use of her email server, obstruction of justice for destroying 33,000 emails under congressional subpoena, and potential self-dealing for profit through her foundation.</description>

You probably don&amp;rsquo;t have a contract with Equifax. Your creditors do.
When you apply for a loan, you give creditors permission to:
*1. Obtain your credit file. *2. Update your credit file.
You expect that creditors vet their vendors, don&amp;rsquo;t you? You assume banks and credit card companies test their vendors&amp;rsquo; security.
And you expect financial services companies like Equifax to be on the up and up.</description>

CNN is reporting that Special Investigator Robert Mueller leaked secret documents to the press indicating the Obama White House &amp;ldquo;wiretapped&amp;rdquo; Paul Manafort before and after last year&amp;rsquo;s election.
CNN previously mocked and scorned President Trump for suggesting Obama wiretapped Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign. CNN says Mueller&amp;rsquo;s office cautioned that conclusions about Russian connection were &amp;ldquo;inconclusive.</description>

      <description>Not often does a person or an event fit every definition of a single word. But Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s life after the election fits perfectly all three definitions of graceless.
__
Graceless.
Graceless Hillary.
Why didn&amp;rsquo;t Donald Trump think of that one during the campaign. &amp;ldquo;Graceless Hillaryâ¦&amp;rdquo;
Not a single rational being could challenge the accuracy of that monicker. Graceless Hillary.
Clumsy.
No sense of propriety or decency.
Inferior or clumsy in treatment or performance.</description>

      <description>Eight months into the Trump Administration, one cabinet appointment stands out as a flop: Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
 We all had a lot of hope. Back in January. Hope.
Hope for the Trump administration. Hope for American greatness. And hope for justice. If you&amp;rsquo;re a Tea Partier, you had a lot of hope.
Jeff Sessions looked like the ultimate pick for Attorney General. Conservatives berated Mitch McConnell to accelerate Sessions&amp;rsquo; confirmation by the Senate.</description>

      <description>Move Over, Enron: Equifax Is Next  The worst problem of modernity lies in the malignant transfer of fragility and antifragility from one party to the other, with one getting the benefits, the other one (unwittingly) getting the harm, with such transfer facilitated by the growing wedge between the ethical and the legal. This state of affairs has existed before, but is acute todayâ modernity hides it especially well.

      <description>By now you&amp;rsquo;ve heard that President Trump struck a deal with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. Trump struck a deal to raise the debt ceiling. Trump struck a deal by going around Congressional Republicans. Trump struck a deal with Democrats.
It&amp;rsquo;s about time, frankly. But Trump can go a lot further on this path. If I were his chief strategist, I&amp;rsquo;d tell him to go further. How far? Keep reading.</description>

      <description>Many people say, &amp;ldquo;you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t punish children for sins of the parent.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s something we firmly believe as Americans. The US Constitution even prohibits &amp;ldquo;corruption of blood.&amp;rdquo; Corruption of blood refers to laws that pass guilt genetically from generation to generation.
I think we can all agree that punishing children for their parents&amp;rsquo; crimes is un-American. But what about children whoÂ profit from their parents&amp;rsquo; crimes? Should they be allowed to keep the booty?</description>

No electricity.
No cell phone or land line.
No radio.
No electric tooth brush.
No internet or cable.
No laptop. No tablet.
Car: nothing.
What happened?
No, it&amp;rsquo;s not a scene from the Twilight Zone. It&amp;rsquo;s the aftermath of an electromagnetic pulse attack. EMP for short.
An EMP attack would look like this:
** North Korea launches an ICBM toward North America ** The warhead detonates 100 miles above Colorado ** Waves of electromagnetic energy pulse down across the fruited plain ** Every semiconductor and small wire in the United States burns out</description>

Maybe it already happened. Maybe we just haven&amp;rsquo;t heard.
Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s aÂ few days away.
But it&amp;rsquo;s coming, folks. Believe me, it&amp;rsquo;s coming. And it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a doozy.
So many lefties were hoping that Hurricane Harvey wouldÂ finally knock out President Trump. If they pray, they prayed. They prayed for a monumental catastrophe. They prayed for total collapse of FEMA.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened.
Someone posted this photo on twitter. All the sane people laughed.
@realDonaldTrump retweeted. And now it&amp;rsquo;s the left&amp;rsquo;s new Russian conspiracy.
I remember when all the best comedians were liberals. But the new left traded its sense of humor for baseball bats with ten penny nails.
USA!
Meanwhile, the pre-schoolers at CNN have their panties in a bunch because the President of the United States wore a hat emblazoned with USA.</description>

 Dear People of Houston (and thereabouts),
President Trump has said, &amp;ldquo;the whole world is watching.&amp;rdquo; And he&amp;rsquo;s right!

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been saying &amp;ldquo;America is back&amp;rdquo; ever since President Trump&amp;rsquo;s beautiful inauguration in January. And we meant it.
  But &amp;ldquo;America is back&amp;rdquo; rose to a higher level today. A level not since the days following 9-11. Or maybe the greatest moments of the Reagan administration.
Today, in Houston, we saw the America of our dreams. The America that makes us cry when we hear the national anthem. Or when we see a soldier in Iraq bending down to help a tiny Iraqi child.</description>

      <description>When I watch President Trump in Texas, I am reminded of one of my favorite books.
Arthur C. Brooks wrote in The Conservative Heart:
 There is a common misconception that conservatives are materialistic. We are not, and this confusion is a central political irony of our time. Progressives truly want to help the poor but have tried to solve poverty primarily with government money, relegating talk of culture to the past and focusing more and more on income inequality.</description>

James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton before interviewing 16 key witnesses.
James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton before he gathered any significant evidence.
James Comey gave Hillary Clinton permission to destroy evidence in a felony investigation.
James Comey leaked classified information to the media.
These are all facts. No one disputes them.
They are all crimes of various degrees. Some felonies.</description>

      <description>It was probably a coincidence.
One day after Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View reported Speaker Paul &amp;ldquo;Dumbbell&amp;rdquo; Ryan as a member of the Antifa caliphate support team, Speaker Ryan&amp;rsquo;s office renounced his membership in the terrorist group&amp;rsquo;s fan club.

As reported by The Gateway Pundit:
 Social media was set ablaze after Paul Ryan attacked President Trump for condemning âboth sidesâ for the violence in Charlottesville. Trump supporters hammered Paul Ryan for refusing to condemn Antifa.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I explained the military strategy behind Antifa&amp;rsquo;s remarkable growth.
In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it, Antifa has effectively shut down grass roots conservative speech. You cannot hold a public rally, march, or carnival if your views conflict with Antifa&amp;rsquo;s.
Antifa has established a small caliphate in North America. Just like ISIS did in Syria and Iraq.
And the government&amp;rsquo;s doing absolutely nothing about it. You should read my military strategy post and all the links.</description>

      <description>If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal, we can flee from him.
    If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.</description>

That reason is the thousands of fraudulent journalists who create and repeat lies about President Trump every day. Like Jake &amp;ldquo;The Fake&amp;rdquo; Tapper. Those fake journalists don&amp;rsquo;t need my help.
You also know that I have criticized President Bush, Republican candidates for president, and many, many other Republicans and conservatives. I just adopted a simple rule last year: until the fake news media treats President Trump honestly and fairly, I won&amp;rsquo;t criticize my president.</description>

      <description>You probably believe the narrative. Because that narrative is strong right now. It has become common knowledge. Common knowledge in the formal, game theory sense of the word.
In game theory, common knowledge is something everyone knows everyone knows. And everyone know everyone knows. And everyone knows how everyone else will behave because of that knowledge.
Common knowledge doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be true. In a common knowledge game, truth doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.</description>

One consequence that we&amp;rsquo;ve all experienced: when you elect a street fighter, you get street fights.
Another consequence that terrorists are experiencing: when you elect a street-fighter patriot, terrorists die.
President Trump tonight reminded so many of us why we elected him. Because he&amp;rsquo;s a street fighter. Because he&amp;rsquo;s a patriot. Because there are bad people who wish us harm, and Donald Trump is okay with killing them.</description>

      <description>CNN screwed up. And it reminds me of an incident from 1970.
A headline writer admitted that the Antifa terror group seeks &amp;ldquo;peace through violence.&amp;rdquo; Later, presumably after receiving threats from Antifa terrorists, CNN removed the &amp;ldquo;peace through violence&amp;rdquo; sub-head.
But the damage was done. CNN stumbled onto real news. Real news that exposes Antifa&amp;rsquo;s terrorist aims.
Before we get to the dangers of normalizing political violence, aka &amp;ldquo;terrorism,&amp;rdquo; let&amp;rsquo;s remember a famous party.</description>

Reputation is what people think of you.Â Character is who you are.

      <description>Charlottesville used to be a place. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s a thing.
On Friday, Charlottesville was a city in Virginia.
Today, Charlottesville is an event. A thing.
In our hyper-emotional world of 2017, we are told to explore our emotions. Then act upon those emotions. Like poorly trained animals. Like half-wits. Like narcissists and spoiled brats. Like lower primates.
Like the KKK and BLM and Antifa thugs who turned that place into a thing yesterday.</description>

      <description>Angry texts.
I got a bunch of very angry texts this morning.
My friends are fired up. Because of Governor Greitens&amp;rsquo;s executive order. **An executive order that implements a novel approach to prescription drug databases.Â **
In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, Governor Greitens signed an executive order on July 17. The EO made Missouri the 50th state to establish some sort of prescription drug tracking.
Most states track everything about prescriptions.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Will Trump survive this?&amp;rdquo;
A friend of mine texted me yesterday. I had no idea what the &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; was. Later, I learned.
Turns out, like most of the media&amp;rsquo;s breathless revelations about Trump&amp;rsquo;s supposed crimes, the story that people reacted to meant little. The anti-Trump media exploded with fake news, fake interpretations of real news, and speculation that supported their own angry fetishes.
But any reasonable person would respond like my friend.</description>

      <description>You know it&amp;rsquo;s coming. Some fake news hack will claim the whole Foxconn-Wisconsin deal was a plot to find a new job for Reince Priebus.
Reince Priebus, the erstwhile White House chief of staff who prides himself on blocking deplorables from the White House posts they deserve, has been relieved of duties. He&amp;rsquo;s on his way back to native Wisconsin where Foxconn is building a $10 billion plant. Maybe Foxconn needs an establishment-connected middle manager.</description>

Pick over or under in the comments.
Winners will get great satisfaction.
I&amp;rsquo;m taking under.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about, Gateway Pundit has it all. It&amp;rsquo;s juicy!
Just yesterday, Washington Times pointed out that the very swampy Priebus is increasingly isolated and lonely in the Trump White House. Nobody likes Reince.</description>

      <description>I campaigned for and voted for Donald Trump. I stand 100% behind Trump today.
I support Trump because he&amp;rsquo;s a fighter. He&amp;rsquo;s a man of action. Trump prosecutes his causes, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t navel gaze.
Jeff Sessions is a good man. He&amp;rsquo;s a good Washington man. He has standards of decorum. Standards I admire.
Trump has no standards of decorum. But I voted for Trump because history has made decorum a liability, even a vice.</description>

All of Western Civilization, all of Christiandom, seemed doomed.
One defiant man ended a speech to his House of Commons with this:
 I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s our nature. Our herding response gave our species an advantage. The herders lived to breed. The wanderers, the stragglers, fell prey. Genes of herders increased. Genes of loners receded.
But our strongest cover is our parents. They&amp;rsquo;re the protection we seek.
The pair of humans who brought us into the world provide the best cover. We are born helpless. Our parents sustain us.</description>

News broke this weekend that Kid Rock is LEADING challenger, Dem Debbie Stabenow in a new pollÂ 30% to 26%!   Everyone who wrote this off as a joke, then as a publicity stunt, then asÂ impossible, then asÂ improbable will be forced to say &amp;ldquo;Senator Rock&amp;rdquo; soon. Very soon.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Some things we can control, some we canât. We can control our attitudes, opinions, goals and desires â choices of our own. We canât control health, wealth, fame or power â things we canât have by choosing them.&amp;rdquo; âEpictetus
 Freedom begins with understanding what we control and we do not. Yet very few people even begin to consider this essential dichotomy.
Even in the complete absence of &amp;ldquo;administration&amp;rdquo; as Tocqueville observed in early 19th century America, no one was free who failed to understand Epictetus&amp;rsquo;s control dichotomy: some things are under our control, some are not.</description>

They worry about this trend toward &amp;ldquo;unserious&amp;rdquo; politicians getting elected.
They worry about &amp;ldquo;what it says about voters&amp;rdquo; who elect Sarah Palin, Donald Trump, and (very soon) Kid Rock.

      <description>Kudos to Governor Greitens and the Missouri legislature. They killed a minimum wage law in St. Louis. The law was designed to make city politicians feel better about themselves. It&amp;rsquo;s certain result would have been fewer jobs for the people who need jobs the most.
Why are you complaining about Governor Greitens&amp;rsquo; first term? Did you not read his books?
Like Donald Trump, Eric Greitens called his plays at the line of scrimmage.</description>

If we take attack North Korea militarily, over a million South Koreans will die. Along with a lot of Americans on ships and on land over there. Nobody wants that. It might come to that, but nobody wants it.
Now, North Korea has ICBMs that can drop a nuke on Alaska.</description>

Was it Trump&amp;rsquo;s 5-0 winning streak in special elections?
Like the ageless question of how many licks it takes to get to the Tootsie-Roll center of a Tootsie-Pop, the world may never know. Never know just when the Russian narrative broke.</description>

You are a conservative activist. They call themselves &amp;ldquo;progressives.&amp;rdquo;
You want to live. And you want to remain active in politics.
They want you dead. Or submissive. Like a slave. Or a battered woman.
No, you can&amp;rsquo;t attack them. You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t engage them. They&amp;rsquo;re rabid animals. Neither reason nor normal persuasion can change progressives from their deadly habits.

      <description>Previously on Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View:
 Because of tolerance, itâs getting harder and harder to make people laugh with Trump jokes. Everybodyâs heard them all. So comedians have to ramp up the shock factor. And they have been. And it was working.
 Until Kathy Griffin went too far.
Comedians and leftist news people are bound to go too far. It&amp;rsquo;s bio-chemical response. And now, so many leftists are in a race to the top on excess and insanity.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to see in the fog of war, but comedienne Kathy Griffin did Donald Trump a huge favor. Before I explain, look at all the benefits Trump got from Griffin&amp;rsquo;s decapitation humor:
** Prominent Democrats and CNN turned against Hillary Clinton ** Andrea Mitchell and other journalists began admitting the Russian conspiracy theory is a hoax ** Americans sympathize with the Trump family ** Kathy Griffin&amp;rsquo;s crazy press conference made Trump look mature, sober, and sane by comparison</description>

      <title>Is the New York Times blackmailing FBI and CIA?</title>

      <description>Sounds ridiculous, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?
How could a reporter at New York Times blackmail an FBI or CIA agent?
Easily. And everyone who ever went through counter-espionage training knows it.
What Went Down This morning, British Prime Minister Theresa May chastised the US government. The UK freely shares anti-terrorism intelligence with the US. The US is expected to keep secrets secret.
But the US intel community is one gigantic sieve these days.</description>

      <description>On the night that a deranged terrorist murdered and maimed little girls in Manchester England, we can take some solace in the fact that the greatest bastion of Western Civilization is back.
America is back.
Back on the watch.
Back on the hunt.
Back in the world.
When President Trump became the first American president to speak in Saudi Arabia, he delivered a message beyond his words. He delivered a message that no one missed.</description>

      <description>Was Seth Rich murdered as an example?
Seth Rich was murdered. Two gunshots to his back. Like you&amp;rsquo;d see on The Sopranos (video). The police called it a robbery. But nothing was stolen. Not his cell phone. Not his wallet. Not his watch. Not his cash.
Shortly after his murder, Wikileaks posted embarrassing emails. Emails from the Democratic National Committee&amp;rsquo;s email server. Wikileaks maintains that the theft of the emails was an inside job.</description>

      <description>From the &amp;ldquo;we could have told you that&amp;rdquo; department:
 Journalists&amp;rsquo; brains show a lower-than-average level of executive functioning, according to a new study, which means they have a below-average ability to regulate their emotions, suppress biases, solve complex problems, switch between tasks, and show creative and flexible thinking. [emphasis added]
 It&amp;rsquo;s okay to laugh. You suspected that reporters are kind of dumb. Now you know. They can&amp;rsquo;t keep up with Trump, but they probably can&amp;rsquo;t keep up with a young adult novella, either.</description>

      <description>Do you follow the recommended diets? Low fat. High carbohydrate? Eat lots of fruit?
If so, you&amp;rsquo;re probably overweight. And your blood tests are probably a mess. Maybe your doctor recommends expensive prescriptions to lower your cholesterol.
A new study finds the problem is not your fault. Your doctor, poorly educated in nutrition, and government recommendations, prompted by industry lobbyists, are designed to keep you fat and sick. And it&amp;rsquo;s not just US government.</description>

      <description>The Easiest Formula for Mastering Persuasion, Losing Weight, and Avoiding Disease (video) &amp;ldquo;Persuasion&amp;rdquo; is part of my job title. When you&amp;rsquo;re a persuasion professional, you get a lot of questions about persuasion. Some are sincere. Others are skeptical, like, &amp;ldquo;Okay, persuasion boy, persuade me to give you a hundred dollars.&amp;rdquo;
Persuasion doesn&amp;rsquo;t work like that. But it also does. Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: if you ask me to persuade you to give me a hundred bucks, you already want to give me a hundred bucks.</description>

      <description>Congress is about to pass a budget. I call it a &amp;ldquo;Paul Ryan Special.&amp;rdquo; This budget lets the government spend money for four months. It expires in September.
The budget is horrible. Republicans are spinning a few &amp;ldquo;wins&amp;rdquo; in the budget, but that&amp;rsquo;s a terrible argument. It&amp;rsquo;s like telling a terminal cancer patient, &amp;ldquo;but your blood pressure&amp;rsquo;s pretty good.&amp;rdquo;
Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: you cannot control Congress. You can only control what you focus on and what you do next.</description>

Remember the GOP race? Cruz and Trump went at each other like nobody&amp;rsquo;s business. Wives and all. While Cruz couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring himself to endorse Trump at the convention, Ted has stepped up a lot since the election.</description>

Every time you leave your teenage kids home alone for a weekend, you come back to stink-eyes from yourÂ neighbors, a living room that&amp;rsquo;s a sea of empty beer cans, a yard filled with cigarette butts, and a pregnant cat.
Pretty soon, you&amp;rsquo;d stop leaving those kids to their own devices, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you? If you had to leave town, you&amp;rsquo;d find a sitter. Maybe a retired Marine uncle. Or a friendly cop to send a car by the house every half hour during the dark hours.</description>

Then you hear wildly successful people say &amp;ldquo;do NOT follow your passion.&amp;rdquo; Mark Cuban is in this camp. So is Dilbert creator Scott Adams.
So which is it? Do you follow your passion or not?
My answer might disappoint you. Because it&amp;rsquo;ll sound evasive. But I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a shot. I&amp;rsquo;ll need you to help out here, though. Think of this as an exercise.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t agree.&amp;rdquo;
Some folks disagreed with my instant assessment of the Syrian strike. My assessment: Trump&amp;rsquo;s surprise military attack will shift four narratives in Trump&amp;rsquo;s favor:
** Trump is Hitler: dead ** Trump is a Russian agent: dead ** Trump is incompetent: dying ** Trump is a lightweight among world leaders: dead
In other words, it took 59 cruise missiles to blow up the left&amp;rsquo;s anti-Trump narratives.
But my friends disagree.</description>

      <description>Susan Rice admitted she lied. She requested unmaskings of Trump associates.
Rice says her unmasking requests were routine. Maybe they were.
We can find out. It&amp;rsquo;s simple data analysis. I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how. But, first, you have to know the right question to ask. And few people do.
Right Questions You hear a lot of talk about whether Susan Rice requested unmasking of Trump associates. That&amp;rsquo;s a good question, but it&amp;rsquo;s not enough.</description>

      <description>Now you know. You can stop doubting. You have more than hope.
The Obama administration spied on Donald Trump and his campaign and transition teams. There is no longer any doubt.
The questions that remain are:
** Who ordered and authorized the illegal wiretaps? ** Who illegally received and disseminated the intelligence? ** What did Obama know?
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to declare the Obama Admin guilty after Evelyn Farkas&amp;rsquo;s admissions on MSNBC.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my mind on priority.
Instead of going to tax reform next, President Trump should work on that big-league infrastructure bill. Now. Fast.
President Trump needs a big win because power is in perception. He also needs to put Democrats in a bind. Plus, he needs to prove he can pass big legislation without all GOP factions on board.
The solution is infrastructure.
During the campaign, Trump spoke of a massive building project to rejuvenate our roads, modernize our airports, and more.</description>

That same thing happened to Obamacare over the years. It&amp;rsquo;s now untouchable.
** Obamacare survived the election of Scott Brown in Massachusetts.

Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to beat the establishment to that punch a little. Because the Freedom Caucus and some of my favorite action organizations looked a little juvenile in this debate. Juvenile and stupid.</description>

      <description>General George S. Patton arrived in North Africa with a single mission: lead the Allied forces to victory over the Hun.
But Patton&amp;rsquo;s assignment was also in response to a miserable and deadly failure of leadership. The failed leadership of General Lloyd Fredendall.
 Fredendall was a Francophobe and an Anglophobe ill-suited to wage coalition warfare; a micromanager who bypassed the chain of command â giving orders as far down as company level; a coward, he allowed animus with subordinates to affect his judgment and undercut their authority; and finally, staring defeat in the face at Kasserine, he tried to pin the blame on others.</description>

 It is absolutely imperative that you as a negotiator understand the importance of this point. You do NOT need this deal, because** to be needy is to lose control and make bad decisions**.</description>

      <description>Today, President Trump changed the game. He changed the Prisoner&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma (coordination) into a game of Chicken (competition).
Lifer Republicans have no experience with games of chicken. They were raised on coordination games.
By changing the game to Chicken, Donald Trump greatly increased the chances that phony Paul Ryan&amp;rsquo;s healthcare will PASS.
Here&amp;rsquo;s why briefly.
Psychologically, people always think they have more time. Republicans, in particular, believe time is limitless. Lifelong Republicans think they can delay any decision until the decision they want is a given.</description>

      <title>Healthcare Strategy: Ignore Government Diet Advice</title>

      <description>Yesterday, I established an end: great health care that ordinary people can afford.
You remember I talked about John Braddock&amp;rsquo;s explanation of strategy: choose the end and work backward. Then forword.
And Braddock&amp;rsquo;s first step after choosing an end: what comes immediately before. That&amp;rsquo;s where we are today.
A few weeks back, I wrote several posts about diet (here and here). I warned you that the government and doctors and, especially, dieticians have been poising us for years.</description>

      <description>Paul Ryan unveiled a health care bill two weeks ago. Ryan&amp;rsquo;s favorite lobbyists wrote it. They wrote it in secret. They dumped it on the House GOP caucus.
A lot of my friends on the right went hermatile. &amp;ldquo;Shoved down our throats!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Obamacare two-point-oh!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Obamacare Lite!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Tyranny!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Entitlements!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Worse than Obamacare!&amp;rdquo; The most frequently used key on the keyboards of tea partiers was the exclamation point!
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get spun up over the way Speaker Ryan handled the bill.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump delivered his budget and a message for Congress.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m lazy, I&amp;rsquo;ll quote Time magazine.
First, the President&amp;rsquo;s message to Congress:
 &amp;ldquo;I urge the members of Congress to remember that last November the American people&amp;rsquo;s message was loud and clear. The mandate for change, expressed by the American people, was not my mandate; it was our mandate.&amp;rdquo;
 Then, the analysis:
 The President&amp;rsquo;s meaning was unmistakable: the public wants deep cuts in both spending and taxes, and any legislator who tries to keep the ax from falling risks putting his own neck under an ax at the polls.</description>

      <description>You can actually FEEL America getting GREAT again!
ADP payroll report shows President Trump made a big down payment on his promise to be the **greatest jobs president ever.Â **
The economy added nearly 300,000 new jobs last month. Economists expected a rise of 190,000. It was the biggest jump in jobs in 6 years.
The jobs were the good kind of jobs Trump talks about: manufacturing, mining. Jobs with grit.</description>

      <description>Almost every time Donald Trump says something crazy, something so outlandish and wrong, he later turns out to be right.
I know his critics can&amp;rsquo;t read my blog. (Literally, they can&amp;rsquo;t. They have a psychological problem that prevents their brains from processing information that&amp;rsquo;s inconsistent with their beliefs.) But for those of you who want to be right with the truth instead of just right with your own opinion, this will be a great post to forward to your friends.</description>

      <description>Newspapers lie. And by &amp;ldquo;newspapers,&amp;rdquo; I mean the whole mainstream media.
Yesterday I told you how Donald Trump punked the media by pulling a Crazy Ivan maneuver. A critic on Twitter thinks I&amp;rsquo;m lying. He thinks I&amp;rsquo;m lying because he read a news article. He read it in the New York Times.
This Twitter critic thinks it&amp;rsquo;s okay for the New York Times to lie (&amp;ldquo;Wiretapped Data Used In Inquiry of Trump Aides&amp;rdquo;), as long as they only lie in their headlines.</description>

      <description>Cold War submarine lore. I can&amp;rsquo;t go into all of it here, but I can tell you about one bit of that lore: the Crazy Ivan.
Modern submarines have incredible passive sonar arrays. They can hear everything in the ocean for hundreds of miles around. Everything.
Everything except something directly behind them. Behind a submarine is a big propeller or &amp;ldquo;screw.&amp;rdquo; It turns. It pushes water abaft. The noise and the motion combine to prevent sound waves from reaching the sensors.</description>

      <description>John McCain may have done some heroic things, but he is a hero no more.
Imagine how you&amp;rsquo;d feel.
A knock on your door.
Through the deadlights around your front door, you see a car with government stencils on the side. When you get close enough, you look out and see a man in uniform. An officer. You know. You know why he&amp;rsquo;s here. Your throat tightens. You want to turn around and walk away.</description>

In 2012, Barack Obama got caught telling Russian Prime Minister Medvedev that he&amp;rsquo;d have more &amp;ldquo;flexibility&amp;rdquo; after the election.
Later in 2012, during a debate, Obama accused GOP candidate Mitt Romney of stoking Cold War fears against our new friends in Moscow. Obama said,Â âThe 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back becauseâ¦the Cold Warâs been over for 20 years!â In fact, in 2012, the whole pantheon of pantsuit partiersmocked warnings about Russia.</description>

In 1966, Hollywood liberals made a very funny movie. The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming! The movie mocked Cold Warriors and ridiculed hyper-paranoia about the dangers posed by Russia.
Some of those same Hollywood liberals are now running around screaming &amp;ldquo;The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!&amp;rdquo;

      <description>You had to laugh. Claire McCaskill jumped on Twitter to announce she&amp;rsquo;d never met the Russian ambassador to the US. Before that, she jumped on Twitter to brag about being so damned important and vital that the Russian ambassador sought her oracle-like guidance.
After people mocked and scorned her silly lie, Claire McCaskill made up more lies to cover the first lie. You know, like a liar.
Senator McCaskill believes Jeff Sessions should resign for not telling a lie.</description>

      <description>The Concorde was a supersonic passenger plane. It shuttled people between New York and Paris very quickly.
When commercial Concorde flights began in 1976, the novelty and excitement of flying at twice the speed of sound led people to line up to take the flights. But after 27 years and several safety mishaps, the Concorde&amp;rsquo;s popularity waned. Flights were often less than half full, so British Airways, the operator, was losing money.</description>

      <description>Hate John McCain if you want. Call McCain a traitor, even.
I look at John McCain and marvel at his strength. Many do.
Everyone knows about McCain being shot down over Vietnam and spending 5 years in a POW camp. But most people don&amp;rsquo;t know about the deep emotional scar McCain brought home with him. And that emotional scar undoubtedly drives him to his fits of anger and telling lies about people he doesn&amp;rsquo;t like.</description>

You can imagine what it&amp;rsquo;s like be in a bad mood, can&amp;rsquo;t you? People go through periods of deep funk when nothing seems bright or cheerful, don&amp;rsquo;t they?
And when you&amp;rsquo;re in those moods, what&amp;rsquo;s the worst thing? That&amp;rsquo;s right, it&amp;rsquo;s being around a bunch of happy people having fun.
And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly how the left feels when they see Trump at a press conference: miserable amid the fun.</description>

      <description>Imagine Michael Jordan&amp;rsquo;s best game ever. Or Tiger Woods. That&amp;rsquo;s what it was like watching President Trump today. Amazing.
The President looked poised, cheerful, and humorous. He volleyed with Jim Acosta of CNN. He rated each question &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bad.&amp;rdquo; He explained why he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want a nuclear war with Russia because the press seems to think nuclear war is a good thing. He mocked those in the press who want him to bomb that Russian intel ship off Virginia.</description>

One large chapter of history ends, and another starts.
 In a very real sense, one society diesâ and another is born.

Okay. Let&amp;rsquo;s call them that.
Author Steven Pressfield wrote a book about defeating The Resistance. It&amp;rsquo;s called The War of Art, and it&amp;rsquo;s an awesome, wonderful book.
Overcoming and defeating The Resistance, Pressfield tells us, is the key to living the good life. I agree, even if I don&amp;rsquo;t agree on some of his enemies.</description>

Imagine yourself surrounded on all sides by angry faces dressed in shabby clothes, some faces covered with bandanas or ski masks.

And you just get sicker and fatter.
You&amp;rsquo;re told it&amp;rsquo;s your fault. But it&amp;rsquo;s probably not.

Actually, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why. But it&amp;rsquo;s happening to you and millions of other people. Doctors are killing their patients. And they&amp;rsquo;re getting a lot of help from the government and big agriculture.</description>

I was always good at this when I was young, but I&amp;rsquo;m not that young anymore. I&amp;rsquo;m 53, but I held my breath for two minutes and 47 seconds last Thursday. And I could have gone longer, but I was bored.</description>

      <description>I know people, and you probably do too, who are out of work from the United Steel Granite City (aka Granite City Steel) closure. It&amp;rsquo;s disheartening and depressing for people who worked hard all those years, thrown into the street because of bad trade deals and stifling regulations.
But President Trump has ordered the Keystone Pipeline renegotiated to require American steel pipes. That&amp;rsquo;s great news for our friends and neighbors in GC.</description>

      <description>President Trump (who, by the way, has accomplished more in two days than Obama did in eight years) saw Chicago&amp;rsquo;s horrific crime statistics and warned the mayor and the governor to get to work or he&amp;rsquo;ll fix it himself. Seventy-five percent of murder victims in Chicago are black.
Immediately, leftists, who apparently enjoy all the carnage in Chicago, attacked Trump&amp;rsquo;s call for fewer shootings and murders.
Think of that.Â LIBERALS WANT MORE MURDER!</description>

      <title>Terrible Day for NeverTrumpâGreat Day for the Constitution</title>

      <description>One way to summarize Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s first business day in office is to say he followed through on many, many campaign promises. Another way to look at it is that Trump slaughtered NeverTrump. Both explanations are accurate, but one is the cause, the other the effect.
First, you know I pay very little attention to Facebook. Too much craziness over there. But friends of mine do occasionally send me screen shots of things they find outrageous.</description>

      <title>Sean Spicer and the White House Press Corp Proved Me 100% Right</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s great to be right.
Yesterday I told you that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer played the White House press corps by telling the truth. But the press corps and many Americans have a psychosis that literally replaces some words with other words. It&amp;rsquo;s not dyslexia. It&amp;rsquo;s far worse because it&amp;rsquo;s selective.
In this case, Spicer said &amp;ldquo;witness&amp;rdquo; but journalists everywhere repeated, &amp;ldquo;attend.&amp;rdquo; I wrote about it here.
Well, today, Spicer explained the situation to a psychotic journalist almost the same way I did.</description>

      <description>When your brain automatically alters perceptions, there&amp;rsquo;s something wrong with you.
Reporters have this psychosis. Journalists. They have very bad ADHD it seems. They can&amp;rsquo;t pay attention. Like kids with ADHD. Chuck Todd and everybody at Business Insider should probably take Ritalin or something.
Reporters are also narcissists. No one goes into journalism unless they have a pathologically inflated ego. No one.
So I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk you through the proof, slowly, so even our narcissistic, hyperactive, attention-deficit-disordered journalists can understand that Sean Spicer played with them like a cat pawing a dying moth.</description>

      <description>A Good Samaritan was shot and killed and three shot in a &amp;ldquo;robbery gone very wrong&amp;rdquo; at Rolling Oaks Mall in San Antonio, Texas Sunday afternoon about 3:30 p.m. Two others transported to hospitals with other medical conditions. One suspect is still at large and assumed armed and dangerous.
The dead man was a shopper who attempted to stop two robbers after they robbed a Kay Jewelers store in the mall.</description>

      <description>Trump&amp;rsquo;s enemies took refuge in the self-created narrative that his campaign was 100% American showmanship. The crooked press and the corrupt establishment, while dissing Trump publicly, scoffed privately. They &amp;ldquo;knew&amp;rdquo; his supporters were idiots and yahoosâmarginally functional Neanderthals from America&amp;rsquo;s unreconstructed backwoods whose ability to think, handicapped by genetics, was further crippled by the moonshine distilled in the shed behind their putrid outhouse for personal consumption by their incest-ridden family of knuckle-dragging racist homophobes.</description>

You know, though, that St. Louis is a mess. A hot, simmering mess covered with rot. (Check out StLouisPatina&amp;rsquo;s photo essay of St. Louis decay.) But the people responsible for St. Louis&amp;rsquo;s decay want you to pretend there are no problems. Of course, they do.
And it&amp;rsquo;s getting worse. You might find yourself wondering how bad things are in St.</description>

Jim was in the crowd at the very first Tea Party in St. Louis, February 27, 2009. A cold Friday. He and more than a thousand other folks took off work and school to see what this protest was all about. Like so many others, Jim knew America needed a change. A big one. A change built on the hopes and dreams and fierce independence of ordinary people.</description>

      <description>Many of us are guilty. I am, too. You, probably.
In high school (and after) we mocked the kids who took shop. The &amp;ldquo;greasers&amp;rdquo; who got credit for wrenching on cars or welding or making cabinets. It was the 1980s and shop, along with home economics, became an elective in most schools.
Until the 80s, some practical life skill class was a requirement at most American public and parochial high schools.</description>

      <description>You thought Stan Kroenke wanted a team in Los Angeles? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. I think Stan is playing a long con. And I think it&amp;rsquo;s a brilliant strategy.
Los Angeles is a terrible market for football teams, but it&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic market for the NFL. It would be a perfect place to build a permanent home for the Super Bowl. Los Angeles has fantastic weather, great attractions, and a huge pool of football fans, fans of every team in the NFL.</description>

      <description>This is about Big Data.
You really can&amp;rsquo;t over-estimate what suckers business people are.
I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about people who create things or improve things. Guys like Steve Jobs and Donald Trump built great businesses. But they weren&amp;rsquo;t business people. They were builders. Running a business was a necessary evil that allowed them the freedom to build what they wanted to build. They were great businessmen because they cared about the work their companies did.</description>

      <description>How will history remember the Tea Party movement of 2009 to 2016? The answer to that question depends on what we do next.
The Tea Party movement was an antagonistic movement. We opposed bad stuff. We sought punishment for bad actors. We saw that the experts were wrong, and we pointed out their folly. Like William F. Buckley&amp;rsquo;s charter for National Review, we stood athwart history, yelling &amp;ldquo;STOP!&amp;rdquo; At its heart, the Tea Party movement opposed a corrupt and insulated establishment class.</description>

      <description>You might have thought I was paranoid for wondering if some people in the CIA and the Deep State are plotting a coup to overturn our recent election.
The Wall Street Journal seems to agree with my conclusion: a coup attempt is going on in America. Rogue actors within the CIA, all of the major leftist media (New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS), and probably major defense contractors seem to be involved, though the Wall Street Journal stops short of accusing advertisers.</description>

      <description>Call me paranoid, but it seems Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s chances of taking the oath of office for President are diminishing every day.
You might find yourself wondering why the CIA would plot a coup against Trump and his supporters. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t wondered about a CIA coup, you should.** Focus your awareness for a moment on what Trump means to the people of the Deep State.**
The Deep State involves those people and institutions that have insulated themselves from the consequences of elections.</description>

      <description>Many powerful interests around the world loathe Donald Trump and the people who elected him. There&amp;rsquo;s no disputing that.
One of those powerful interests is the Central Intelligence Agency. One of the CIA&amp;rsquo;s own, Evan McMullin, attempted to disrupt the election. Like Bay of Pigs and Saddam&amp;rsquo;s weapons of mass destruction, that CIA plot failed. Even George Will admits the CIA makes some horrible, deadly mistakes. And sometimes those mistakes come from seeing the results they want to see, not the results presented.</description>

      <description>No one saw this coming.
In the month since the election on November 8, America burst out of the longest economic malaise since the Great Depression. Historians will credit the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. Those historians will be right, of course, but how can that be? President Trump won&amp;rsquo;t take office until Friday, January 20, 2017. Today is December 8, 2016. Yet Trump has already transformed America more in four weeks than Barack Obama did in eight years.</description>

      <description>Kellogg sells mostly simple carbohydrates in the form of breakfast cereal and snacks. Their ad agencies make you think their foods are wholesome and safe. They&amp;rsquo;re not. They&amp;rsquo;re mostly simple carbohydrates (grains and sugar) that produce a glycemic shock when eaten. And foods that produce glycemic shock seem to be deadlier than cigarettes. At least that&amp;rsquo;s the suggestion from a recent study at theÂ University of Texas.
The study of 2,000 lung cancer patients and 2,500 people without lung cancer should raise concern.</description>

      <description>Tonight, Donald Trump delivered what will become the new standard of presidential oratory in Cincinnati, OH. President-elect Trump thanked Ohio voters for a landslide victory in the state with a barnburner of a speech that rivaled his most animated and colorful rally speeches during the 2015-2016 campaign.
The art of the speech will never be the same.
Frequently breaking from prepared remarks, Trump attacked the dishonest media, mocked a leftist reporter who cried when Hillary lost, and reminded voters, &amp;ldquo;Folks, how many times did we hear this?</description>

      <description>Jill Stein has raised nearly $7 million in an effort to overturn election results in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. She has no chance of winning any of those states, and Hillary Clinton has joined Team Stein.
So what&amp;rsquo;s the point?
Apparently,Stein and Clinton want the recounts to miss their December 19 deadline. December 19 is the Constitutionally mandated Electoral College vote. If the recounts are incomplete on the 19th, voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania will be disenfranchised, no candidate will have 270 electoral votes, and the election will be thrown to the US House of Representatives.</description>

Castro was greeted in hell by his peers Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong, Pol Pot, Mussolini, and Hitler.
Castro was last seen paddling away from the Caribbean hellhole on a raft bound for hell.
Castro leaves behind a nation trapped in the 1950s.
Repeating our top story tonight: Cuban dictator Fidel Castro is still valiantly holding on in his fight to remain dead.</description>

      <description>Chapter Six âEvan, this is Roger.â
âHowâs it going? Where are you?â
âIâm at home. Listen, Iâm going to haveÂ to use a sick day today.â
âEverything okay?â
âNot really. Itâs a long story. David got beat up pretty bad yesterday at school. In school,â Roger said.
âWell, hell. Sorry to hear that. Donât worry about anything. Iâve got you covered.â
âThanks, Evan. Sorry about this.â
âNo worries. Itâs the slow season anyway.</description>

Nancy Flandersâ assistant, Elizabeth Schneider, nodded her head, scribbled a note, and continued eating her bagel dripping with pineapple cream cheese and strawberry jam.
Flanders returned to her office and closed the door. She sat and snatched the receiver from he desk phone, pressed two numbers, then hung up. She glanced out the window toward the schoolâs playground then reached for the cell phone on her desk.</description>

      <description>You might have heard that President-elect Trump has said he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to waste time and attention on Hillary&amp;rsquo;s email server. You also might have heard that some people are upset about that. I&amp;rsquo;m not one of them.
Months ago I was telling people Trump should announce that, if elected, he will pardon Hillary Clinton for all crimes related to her email scandal. I had two reasons for promoting this strategy.</description>

      <description>We are watching The Fourth Turning unfold before our eyes.
While you should read all of The Fourth Turning by generational historians William Strauss and Neil Howe, here&amp;rsquo;s one of their predictions for this point in time. The prediction was published in 1997:
 The economy will in time recover from its early and vertiginous reversals. Late in the Crisis, with trust and hope and urgency growing fast, it may even achieve unprecedented levels of efficiency and production.</description>

      <description>Every Constitutional conservative knows there&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as &amp;ldquo;states&amp;rsquo; rights.&amp;rdquo; Only people have rights. Governments have powers. People have the right to grant government powers. Governments have no power to assume powers not granted by the people. Anyone who says &amp;ldquo;states&amp;rsquo; rights&amp;rdquo; needs a basic course in political philosophy.
For years, a few conservatives mistakenly defended &amp;ldquo;states&amp;rsquo; rights&amp;rdquo; when they meant to say &amp;ldquo;federalism.&amp;rdquo; When conservatives made this error, the left jumped all over them.</description>

      <description>Roger, David, and Natalie, drove home from the hospital in relative silence. It was already dark at six-thirty. Traffic was still snarled as drivers got used to the end of daylight savings.
When they arrived home, David went to his bedroom and Natalie followed. The post-concussion protocol called for lots of rest, no electronics, and soft lighting. David went straight to bed.
Roger walked into his home office with a glass of whiskey.</description>

      <description>Roger pulled into the parking garage near St. Maryâs Hospital. Midday, the garage was packed. Roger parked on the roof and sprinted to the stairs. He crossed the short bridge to the third-floor reception area and approached the desk.
âIâm Roger Thompson. My son David was brought here,â he said.
The woman at the desk smiled at him, then typed on her keyboard. âCan I see your driverâs license please?â she asked Roger.</description>

      <description>Last week&amp;rsquo;s election demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the United States are still plural. Let me explain.
Language changes. Sometimes those changes alter what things mean. And because of the odd way the brain deals with language, some changes create constant confusion in our heads.
Once upon a time, &amp;ldquo;the United States of America&amp;rdquo; was a plural noun. (I&amp;rsquo;ll prove it to you in a moment.) Careful writers and speakers would say &amp;ldquo;the United States are .</description>

      <description>Roger Thompsonâs phone vibrated in his pocket. His boss, Evan, couldnât hear the vibrating phone, but he noticed Rogerâs distraction.
âDo you need a minute?â Evan asked Roger.
âNo. Sorry. Damn phone wonât quit ringing. Iâll turn it off.â
âMaybe itâs important. Go ahead.â
Roger pulled the phone from his pocket and looked.

      <description>Last weekI made three bold predictions about how Trump would change American culture:
*1. Marriage would rebound, as would the fertility rate *2. People would dress better *3. Legacy becomes physical things, not mere laws
Trump&amp;rsquo;s influence on American culture can already be seen in marriage and divorce rates. According to Bloomberg, divorce is down to 35-year lows and marriage rates began pumping up during the recent campaign.

If you&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about policy, you&amp;rsquo;re thinking really, really small. Trump&amp;rsquo;s influence is way bigger. Here are three ways Trump will change America for a generation.

      <description>Have you ever noticed that twins have a pecking order? Even identical twins born minutes apart show a subtle seniority complex. Usually the first-born twin leads the second-born.
Makes you wonder how these Peterson twins will relate to each other, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?
Because of the time change at the end of daylight saving time, the second-born twin is officially older than the first. That&amp;rsquo;ll be interesting to watch. And if you find yourself pondering the oddness of those twins&amp;rsquo; birth order, you can easily find yourself pondering America&amp;rsquo;s little sister relationship to the UK.</description>

      <description>Adam Carolla noticed something I didn&amp;rsquo;t.
Carolla&amp;rsquo;s first reaction to the election results was this. Hillary Clinton built herself a Logan&amp;rsquo;s Run type palace for her would-be coronation. Donald Trump accepted the presidency in a room that might double as a Hometown Buffet.
Put another way, here&amp;rsquo;s what the winner&amp;rsquo;s auditorium:

      <description>Sometimes I forget what originally drove me to call for a tea party protest in St. Louis.
One motivation was fear of missing out because a dozen other cities were planning protests. Another driver was a desire change the direction of the country. And at least some of it was the frustrated actor in me looking for an outlet.
Since two-thirds of those motivations appeal only to me, letâs focus on the middle one: change the country.</description>

      <description>A few people have called me tonight to ask my prediction on the election. They know I&amp;rsquo;ve predicted a Trump landslide. They want to know if I stand by it.
My answer: blank slate.
I have no expectations. None. I have preferences, but no expectations.
It&amp;rsquo;s kind of silly to expect something you have little or no control over. I have no control over James Comey or Loretta Lynch, much less the millions of American and non-Americans who will vote.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s easy to panic or get mad or dejected. Totally understandable. But that&amp;rsquo;s totally counterproductive, too. And being mad or acting dispirited is just what the elites want us to do.</description>

 Whose Party Is It, Anyway? - Molly Ball, The Atlantic The Republican Debate Was Awesome - David Harsanyi, The Federalist You Cannot Embarrass Donald Trump - Ezra Klein, Vox The Beginning of the End for Trump - Ed Rogers, Washington Post Martin O&amp;rsquo;Malley, the Dems&amp;rsquo; Fallback?</description>

A lot of people thought I was nuts, that I was reading too much into the White House statement that discredited Hillary&amp;rsquo;s primary talking point aboutÂ James Comey.
But today the Gateway Pundit reports that Michelle Obama has scrubbed all references** to Hillary Clinton from both of her Twitter timelines**.</description>

      <description>You might have dated someone who was amazingly good looking. Everything&amp;rsquo;s great. For awhile. Then you get to know the person. A little too well. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s on a weekend trip. Or, God forbid, when you move in together. Then you realize looks aren&amp;rsquo;t everything.
The same thing can happen in political &amp;ldquo;marriages.&amp;rdquo; That surface quality that attracted youâdonors, influence, contacts, whateverâsometimes isn&amp;rsquo;t worth the price.

      <description>You never expect a candidate&amp;rsquo;s surrogates to tell you their candidate is a crook. But that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what Hillary&amp;rsquo;s surrogates are telling you now.
From Bill Richardson to Robby Mook, Clinton surrogates are reciting a strange and disturbing talking point: Voters have &amp;ldquo;baked in&amp;rdquo; Clinton&amp;rsquo;s life of crime.
[FLASHBACK: I gave James Comey the benefit of the doubt in July]
The talking point seems meant to keep Democrats from panicking over theÂ FBI&amp;rsquo;s re-opened criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.</description>

      <description>Everyone knows that the White House is interfering with the FBI&amp;rsquo;s investigation of Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s criminal conspiracies. We know this because the Justice Department is stonewalling the FBI&amp;rsquo;s request for a warrant to search the hard drive Huma Abedin shared with her ex-husband Anthony Weiner.
For those of us too young to remember those black-and-white days of Watergate, here&amp;rsquo;s a brief timeline via Watergate.info:
** July 13, 1973:Â Alexander Butterfield, former presidential appointments secretary, reveals in congressional testimony that since 1971 Nixon had recorded all conversations and telephone calls in his offices.</description>

      <description>As I pointed out last Saturday, a tiny faction of Missouri conservatives prefers Missouri&amp;rsquo;s pathetic status quo to true leadership and positive change. Those people apparently approve of Missouri&amp;rsquo;s horrible economy, weak schools, and declining stature in the country. And nowhere does Missouri&amp;rsquo;s decline stand out like San Diego, California.
Last week, I spent a few days bumming around San Diego with my son. He is stationed there in the US Navy.</description>

      <description>My phone was vibrating like a like a sex toy all afternoon. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t look. I was with a client and teammates working on serious business.
When I got a break, after the client left, I locked myself in a bathroom stall and looked at the messages.
 Comey is reopening Hillary investigation
 New emails have been found

Donna Brazile colluded with Hillary&amp;rsquo;s campaign and Roland Martin to feed debate to questions to Hillary before a debate.
Hillary personally ordered violent protesters to disrupt Trump events.
Hillary, Brazile, and PACS broke the law by colluding on disrupting Trump events.

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s play a little thought experiment.
Suppose you read that a scientific study proved dark blue socks look best with a gray suit. Then someone known for his remarkable sense of style shows up wearing purple striped socks with a gray suit. What would you do?
Before you answer that, consider this.
You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard that a handful of conservative activists are supporting the Democrat running for governor. Those misguided conservatives think the GOP nominee isn&amp;rsquo;t conservative enough.</description>

      <title>Democrats Rig Every Election</title>

      <description>Donald Trump is taking exactly the right approach on the upcoming rigged election.
Every election since 1960 has involved massive election rigging by Democrats. They laugh about it privately and act all offended by the accusation in public.
Republicans let it happen. Republicans like John McCain believe they have a &amp;ldquo;duty&amp;rdquo; to concede even if an election is rigged. They called &amp;ldquo;honorable.&amp;rdquo; But conceding a rigged election is actually a moral failing.</description>

      <description>Some people on the right say they won&amp;rsquo;t vote for Trump. Those people list various reasons, mostly about his demeanor and things he&amp;rsquo;s said in the past. They think who gets the credit is more important than what gets done. We all know people like that, don&amp;rsquo;t we?
Most of those NeverTrumpers were okay with Trump&amp;rsquo;s policies. They all love his Supreme Court list. Most of them liked Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s ideas, and Cruz&amp;rsquo;s weren&amp;rsquo;t far from Trump&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Outcomes.
NeverTrumpers seem to believe that the act of voting is a sort of magic spell that can right all past wrongs. Psychologists call this &amp;ldquo;magical thinking.&amp;rdquo; Children do it. Magical thinking is the belief that we can change the outside world with our thoughts. Think of rain dances and crossed fingers. Or, as Dr. Ben Hunt explains, Fed policy.
Father Christopher J. Pollard, writing in Catholic News Agency, destroys the NeverTrump argument in his essay &amp;ldquo;On Voting.</description>

      <description>If Hillary Clinton wins, Barack Obama will take Antonin Scalia&amp;rsquo;s seat on the Supreme Court.
You NeverTrump cowards need to go read everything you&amp;rsquo;ve written about Barack Obama. Read what you said about his sick dream to fundamentally transform America. Read everything you&amp;rsquo;ve written about his hatred of American exceptionalism.
But go deeper. Stop being cowards for ten minutes and recall what you&amp;rsquo;ve said and thought about Barack Obama. In private conversations.</description>

      <description>Some people have already decided which candidate to vote for. According to polls, slightly more people favor the psychopath over the braggart.
For the undecided, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d create a simple quiz that will tell you whether you&amp;rsquo;re more comfortable with a President who says ugly things and brags about accomplishments or a president who gets people killed and gives away national secrets for cash. I know, it&amp;rsquo;s a tough call.</description>

      <description>Have you ever met someone who&amp;rsquo;s just nasty? Mean? Self-centered? Treats &amp;ldquo;little people&amp;rdquo; like dirt?
If you answered &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to any of these questions, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably met Hillary Clinton. Hillary is likely a psychopath according to official FBI documents released Friday.
What is psychopathy? For the answer, let&amp;rsquo;s go to the bookÂ Almost a PsychopathÂ (h/t Eric Barker):
 Psychopathy is a psychological condition in which the individual shows a profound lack of empathy for the feelings of others, a willingness to engage in immoral and antisocial behavior for short-term gains, and extreme egocentricity.</description>

It is perfectly legal to visit the Wikileaks.com website. You can even copy information found on the site. Yet CNN&amp;rsquo;s paid liars are telling viewers it&amp;rsquo;s against the law. Plus, they&amp;rsquo;re saying the only way you are allowed to learn the content of the Wikileaks documents is to have it filtered through CNN&amp;rsquo;s official state-sponsored Department of Truth.</description>

Something Unrelated At the end of our talk, the reporter said, &amp;ldquo;do you mind if I ask you about something else? It has nothing to do with my article, and I won&amp;rsquo;t write about it.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Lying is tough business.
People believe lies with more details. Time, date, people, exact words, what people were wearing, sequences of events. All that. So liars usually provide some gripping details to make their lies more believable.
In casual conversation, this works. Once some sucker buys your lie, you&amp;rsquo;re pretty much in the clear. The problem comes when you broadcast your lie for maximum coverage. The more people who hear the lie, the more people try to verify those details.</description>

      <description>I really want to go to bed, but my brain won&amp;rsquo;t sleep until I type this out.
Hillary Clinton told us Trump won the debate with her final answer. Final answer.
An audience member asked the closing question. He challenged the candidates to say something nice about their opponents. Hillary went first.
The right way to answer those screwball questions is to say something nice and sit down. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why in a moment.</description>

      <description>People in the media and the GOP are acting like they learned something on Friday. That&amp;rsquo;s when the Washington Post released an audio (later conjoined with video) of Donald Trump talking lewd about his exploits with women.
I say media people and Republicans are &amp;ldquo;acting&amp;rdquo; like they learned something, because they didn&amp;rsquo;t. We didn&amp;rsquo;t. Everybody who&amp;rsquo;s paid attention to the race (or pop culture) already knew how Trump is. Everybody knows Trump brags about his sexual prowess and how women melt around him.</description>

      <description>Today, Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) abandoned her party&amp;rsquo;s nominee to support a rape accomplice for President. Ann Wagner has lost her moral authority on all matters outside of her own home. I call on Mrs. Wagner to resign from the House of Representatives and to retire gracefully from public life.
Mrs. Wagner seems to believe that being a woman gives her some unique moral vantage point. She forgets that she&amp;rsquo;s not the only woman in America.</description>

      <description>You might have heard that the Clinton campaign released the 2005 audio of Donald Trump on Friday to affect Sunday&amp;rsquo;s debate.
Maybe, but not likely. It&amp;rsquo;s more likely that the story dropped to cover up the latest Hillary email scandal. Gwen Ifill agrees (via Breitbart):
 we would have been paying attention a lot more tonight to some revelations from WikiLeaks about Hillary Clintonâs email â her latest email tranche from the State Department.</description>

I won&amp;rsquo;t bore you with the biology of it all, but you probably realize that men and women are fundamentally different. Especially when it comes to reproductive success.</description>

      <description>Your life is in danger. At this moment, a Chinese nuclear warhead sits in a missileÂ silo. Its guidance, if launched, instructs the warhead to detonate a mile or two above your home. And this was all made possible by extortion, murder, and illegal campaign contributions to Bill and Hillary Clinton.
Remember Ron Brown? Brown was Clinton&amp;rsquo;s Secretary of Commerce.
Ron Brown ran the Clintons&amp;rsquo; extortion racket in the 1990s.</description>

Obama&amp;rsquo;s Secretary of the Navy eliminated the 241-year-old Navy enlisted rating system. Because Obama felt the ratings were too politically incorrect? They weren&amp;rsquo;t gender neutral. Via

      <description>You probably know that I admire Scott Adams quite a bit. He&amp;rsquo;s brilliantly predicted everything Trump has done. And he&amp;rsquo;s not finished dazzling us with his prediction skills.
Yesterday he made a prediction of how we&amp;rsquo;ll kill ISIS. It isn&amp;rsquo;t pretty. He&amp;rsquo;s not advocating what will happen. He&amp;rsquo;s just telling us what will happen.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to offer an alternative end to ISIS. It&amp;rsquo;s one I&amp;rsquo;ve advocated for attacking radical Islam since 2001.</description>

Today we learned that Comey flat out lied about Cheryl Mills&amp;rsquo;s immunity agreement. Rep.

      <description>I love breaking from convention. I get tired of doing the same things, the same ways for no particular reason. If you&amp;rsquo;d asked me about dropping opening and closing statements from presidential debates, I&amp;rsquo;d have said &amp;ldquo;give it try.&amp;rdquo;
Well, Lester Holt gave it a try.
I want the statements back.
Last night, the debate began with a question and ended with an answer. No opening or closing. Without those framing statements, the whole thing felt like middle musicâa name my colleague gave to the music in upscale hotel lobbies that just goes on and on.</description>

      <description>Donald Trump missed numerous opportunities to use humor to destroy Hillary Clinton Monday night.
The clearest example was on Lester Holt&amp;rsquo;s question on cyber security. Hillary went first and gave a long, robotic answer, hitting all the buzzwords her handlers made her memorize.
Trump countered with a similar answer. But Trump could have crippled Hillary with a single line:
 If you&amp;rsquo;re worried about cyber security, don&amp;rsquo;t elect a woman who runs an email server out of her basement.</description>

      <description>Liveblogging the biggest debate in history.
Before that, you should read my proposed closing remarks for Donald Trump. Someone told me on twitter that there will be no closing remarks. So maybe Mr. Trump will use my prompts for his opening statement.

      <description>If he asked me, here&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;d end the debate of the century.
First, I&amp;rsquo;d close off any open loops that arose during the debate. Then:
 American children under 10 have never known a year with three-percent GDP growth. Americans under 40 have no memory real wages going up. And American people of every age, from infant to elderly, never knew a time of greater threat from foreign terrorist attack.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll make this short. I have been highly critical of Senator Roy Blunt for a long time. You can search my blog and find many things that bother me about the Blunts, but that&amp;rsquo;s not what this is about.
This post is about whether the US Constitution survives.
This post is about whether that government of the people, by the people, and for the people will perish from the earth.</description>

      <description>This is for the people, like me, who realized sometime between June 2015 and June 2016 that Donald Trump is at least better than Hillary and possibly a transformational character who can reverse America&amp;rsquo;s descent into chaos.

      <description>If you thought the government never made a mistake, this story might surprise (via Breitbart)
 WASHINGTON (AP) â The U.S. government has mistakenly granted citizenship to at least 858 immigrants who had pending deportation orders from countries of concern to national security or with high rates of immigration fraud, according to an internal Homeland Security audit released Monday.
 The Homeland Security Departmentâs inspector general found that the immigrants used different names or birthdates to apply for citizenship with U.</description>

As you watch the polls shift rapidly toward Trump, you might wonder what&amp;rsquo;s happening. What&amp;rsquo;s happening is completely natural, but it&amp;rsquo;s not normal. Elections don&amp;rsquo;t usually go this way. And two psychological phenomena are working to deliver the Trump landslide I predicted long ago.</description>

   @whennessy i never made an issue of Trump&amp;rsquo;s use of the word bomb. so the whole premise of this is nonsense.

The controversy began when Hillary Clinton attacked Donald Trump for calling terrorist bombings in New Jersey and New York &amp;ldquo;bombs.&amp;rdquo; But in the same interview, Hillary called the bombings &amp;ldquo;bombing,&amp;rdquo; making her look like an idiot.</description>

      <description>After the Phillies beat the Dodgers on September 20, they owned a 6.5-game lead over the Reds and Cardinals, who were tied for second place. Philadelphia then hosted Cincinnati for three games, and the visiting Reds won all three. Then the Phillies hosted Milwaukee for four, and the visiting Braves won all four. At the end of that series, the Reds were in first place, a game ahead of the Phillies and 1.</description>

      <description>You might wonder why I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about magic so much. What if you let yourself think about magic for a moment? Your mind can make all kinds of connections. It&amp;rsquo;s as if your mind takes you on a journey inside when you think about magic. When you hear &amp;ldquo;magic,&amp;rdquo; you instantly feel like a kid, don&amp;rsquo;t you? Perhaps you can remember when magic was as real to you as your favorite pillow or a treasured blanket.</description>

You might find yourself rolling your eyes and thinking youâre too old and too smart for magic letters, but the more you read, the more you might wish this letter really is magic.
If youâre still reading, you might even laugh a little at how stupid this sounds.</description>

As you ponder Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s fall from grace (even David Axelrod is trashing her now), you might remember Jimmy Carter&amp;rsquo;s collapse.
I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about his collapse on election night. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about one of the two incidents that psychologically destroyed Carter&amp;rsquo;s image as a leader. In a moment, I&amp;rsquo;ll remind you of the collapse.</description>

      <description>Earlier I said the press has covered up Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s horrible health problems. The press (or media as some call it) now admit as much. But they&amp;rsquo;re trying to weasel out of their culpability. See this line from an otherwise sound article on Commentary:
 Â While most serious people dismissed the rumors about Clintonâs health that were being circulated by Donald Trumpâs supporters, what happened Sunday morning will deepen suspicions both about her health and whether her campaign has been telling the truth about it.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;re glad Ronald Reagan was once President, you should thank Phyllis Schlafly.
Unfortunately, Mrs. Schlafly passed away, so you can&amp;rsquo;t thank her personally. But you can celebrate her life and her swift entrance to heaven.

      <description>You might find yourself freaking out that NRA endorsed the Democrat for Missouri Governor instead of Republican Eric Greitens. If you think about it, though, the endorsement makes perfect sense from the NRA&amp;rsquo;s perspective.
You realize that the NRA is a lobbying firm, and lobbyists have an easier time working with anÂ established asset like Koster than cultivating an outsider like Greitens. Recruiting and cultivating an asset is to a lobbyist as finding and selling a new customer is to a business.</description>

So let&amp;rsquo;s just pretend it&amp;rsquo;s September 20, one week before the Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump appear at a joint press conference. (It&amp;rsquo;s not a debate. Hillary&amp;rsquo;s health won&amp;rsquo;t be up to a debate that soon.)

      <description>The FBI dumped its Clinton criminal investigation report today, and it&amp;rsquo;s full of bombshells. Bombs are exploding like the 4th of July, especially the way Clinton lied about Gen. Colin Powell.
Clinton has maintained that Powell advised her to use a private email and cell phone instead of using secure systems provided by the US government.
Hillary lied.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what the FBI found:
 Clinton contacted former Secretary of State Colin Powell via e-mail to inquire about his use of a BlackBerry while he was Secretary of State .</description>

      <description>Donald Trump will land in Mexico City. He&amp;rsquo;s there for a summit meeting with Mexico&amp;rsquo;s President Pena Nieto.
Before Trump even woke up this morning, the Washington Post declared the future meeting a complete disaster that Trump will never recover from. The Post predicted a complete visual and verbal disaster even though there&amp;rsquo;s no historical evidence on which to base such a prediction.
The WaPo is probably projecting its wishes, not its beliefs.</description>

 His report (featured below) found that black voters care most about lowering taxes in their community, having a strong leader, creating jobs, changing the tax code to help workers and small businesses, making college affordable, and improving the financial health of the US.</description>

      <description>Admit it: words trump action. And words trump results.
No one really cares what you do or the consequences of your actions. They care about what you say.
That&amp;rsquo;s what we learned in school, right? That action is cheap but words are priceless. You probably memorized this nursery rhyme:
 Verbs and nouns Can break our crowns But deeds can never hurt us.
 There was another nursery rhyme with the same meter and opposite meaning.</description>

      <description>If you enjoy this post, you have to thank your fellow reader, Tony, for reading the whole TIME article from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post. He pointed out more similarities between 1980 and 2016. Especially Reagan&amp;rsquo;s gaffes and Democrats&amp;rsquo; complacency.
First, the gaffes.
You hear about Trump stepping on his own applause lines. He announced Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway the day after the best speech of his life (until then). He wondered aloud (via Twitter) what Mr.</description>

      <description>You probably remember that in September 1980 voters couldnât wait to cast a vote for Reagan.
If you remember it like that, you remember wrong. At least a little wrong.
TIME magazine examined voter sentiment in its September 15, 1980, issue. Voters that year sounded a lot like voters this year. Hereâs how TIMEâs Ed Magnuson summarized the voters of 1980:
 Disenchanted, but not apathetic. Caring about issues, although much more concerned about character.</description>

Trump gave a head fake. Everybody bought it. (Including me.) Then his legs went the other way, and we stand here flailing at the air. Some people&amp;rsquo;s heads exploded on CNN. BOOM! I&amp;rsquo;ll reveal the real misdirection in a moment. You&amp;rsquo;ll love it.

      <description>The Gateway Pundit, Jim Hoft, was pro-Trump long before I was. Like me, he&amp;rsquo;s fed up with the politically correct elites who profit while America burns. And Jim recognized long before I did that Donald Trump isÂ the voice for American greatness, for the dignity of meaningful work, for the security of strong borders.
Jim Hoft will be among the featured speakers at the St. Louis area Tea Party for Trump on August 28, 2016 at Surdyke Harley-Davidson in Festus.</description>

      <description>Franceâs population had changed considerably since 1614. The non-aristocratic members of the Third Estate now represented 98 percent of the people but could still be outvoted by the other two bodies. In the lead-up to the May 5 meeting, the Third Estate began to mobilize support for equal representation and the abolishment of the noble vetoâin other words, they wanted voting by head and not by status. While all of the orders shared a common desire for fiscal and judicial reform as well as a more representative form of government, the nobles in particular were loath to give up the privileges they enjoyed under the traditional system.</description>

      <description>You might be wondering why the Missouri Farm Bureau endorsed Democrat Chris Koster instead of Republican Eric Greitens. The Farm Bureau endorses Republicans about 99% of the time.
If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking it had to do with policy or personality, you&amp;rsquo;re thinking wrong. (And, no, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t because of Koster&amp;rsquo;s hair, Mark Reardon.)Â This was all about the establishment vs. the people.Â It&amp;rsquo;s about power and control. Greitens threatens the establishment.</description>

      <title>Purpose Trumps Policy and PrinciplesâVideo</title>

      <description>Why did Trump beat Ted Cruz?Â Probably the biggest reason is that Trump talks purpose while Cruz talks policy and principles.
When people hear Trump, they hear a purpose that aligns with their purpose. I know I do. And it&amp;rsquo;s similar to the purpose Arthur C. Brooks explained in his great book, The Conservative Heart.
Ted Cruz never seemed to have a purpose, just policies and principles. Cruz spoke of abstract principles and left it to the people to figure out if those principles would make their lives better or worse.</description>

      <description>Navy SEAL Eric Greitens won the first political race of his life. Few first timers win a major party&amp;rsquo;s nomination for governor of a state. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably hear just how rare Greitens&amp;rsquo;s feat was. But not tonight. I want to tell some stories.
Eric Greitens gave up a morning of this campaign to talk to one of my kids. That kid is a man now. He&amp;rsquo;s in the Navy at a helo combat squadron in San Diego.</description>

I got home from door knocking for Eric at about 6:30 and walked straight to my laptop to write. Just as I sat down, my wife called me to dinner. She&amp;rsquo;d already eaten, but she heated up my dinner, called to me, then walked into our living room and shrieked.</description>

   President Obama and his allies are trying to hijack the Republican primary in Missouri by attacking my good friend Eric Greitens.
    Like me, Eric is a conservative outsider, and that means the political establishment is terrified of him. Obama and his allies are now spending a million dollars falsely attacking Eric Greitens and trying to fool the people of Missouri.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about how we can be way more persuasive. Persuasion is what wins elections. Not facts. Persuasion. The more you know about persuasion, the more your side will win.</description>

      <description>Do you want to help Democrats win? You can, and the Democratic Governors Association just told you how.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a Republican and you follow the advice of the Democratic Governors Association, you won&amp;rsquo;t vote for Eric Greitens. The DGA wants Democrat Chris Koster to win, so Democrats are telling Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Republicans not to nominate Greitens. Democrats believe Greitens beats Koster in November.
Smart people know that you watch what people do, not what they say.</description>

Why Now? Why did Holzer choose last week to out himself? Why show himself now, putting his old boss, John Brunner, in such a bad light? And right before the August 2 primary?
**Holzer has damaged Brunner&amp;rsquo;s reputation and credibility.Â **And Brunner spent a ton of his own money in the process, including paying $100,000 to the guy who made the video, then squealed about it.</description>

      <description>Why in the world would a political operative who once worked for John Brunner out himself and expose Brunner as either a liar or a patsy two weeks before an election?
 Reggie Lampert: Of course, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to lie on your back for a while but then you can lie from any position, can&amp;rsquo;t you? &amp;ndash;Charade, 1963
 Things just got weirder in Missouri. After the stunning revelation that people associated with John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s campaign did, in fact, produce a false, negative video attacking Eric Greitens, you might be wondering what&amp;rsquo;s going on?</description>

      <description>Contrasts.
Two Politico stories, just weeks apart, demonstrate the remarkable contrasts between the two candidates for president.
The headline of the Trump story tells it all:
 Trump raised $32 million with RNC, but kept only a fraction.
 And the Hillary story:
 Leaked emails show officials tried to obscure the fact that Clinton allowed states to keep only a tiny fraction of proceeds from joint fundraising.
 Trump is on Team America.</description>

      <title>Trump Had But One Speech to Give for His Country, and It Was Perfect</title>

      <description>Now it makes so much sense. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I missed it. Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign is so perfectly consistent, it&amp;rsquo;s almost scary. No, it is scary. It means we&amp;rsquo;re down to our last hope.
When I Turned On Trump I put this in my book, Turning On Trump. I remember the night. I wrote late. Something hit me like wolves howling in the distance. Telling me something had changed. Or some ancient truth, long buried, had been uncovered.</description>

      <description>Another terrorist attack is going on in Munich, Germany right now. At least 3 people are dead, but police can&amp;rsquo;t get into the shooting sites to find out how bad it is. Shooters are still at large. All public transportation has been shut down because terrorists are shooting up subways, too. There&amp;rsquo;s a 99% chance the terrorists are Muslim immigrants. This is what Hillary&amp;rsquo;s immigration plan looks like.
Two days ago, a Muslim immigrant went on an ax-hacking spree on a German train.</description>

      <description>Donald J. Trump overwhelmed the political class last night, smashing up their temple. He destroyed the media myths of everything. Everything. Donald Trump is the anti-myth, the truth-teller, the blunt reporter of reality on reality&amp;rsquo;s terms. And his speech, his reality manifesto, stole the hearts of thevast majority of Americas.
So many myths dispelled.

      <description>Parts pulled from comments to this post:
Today Cruz proved himself to be Lyin&amp;rsquo; Ted again.
After swearing that his non-endorsement was all about &amp;ldquo;freedom and the Constitution,&amp;rdquo; he admitted today that he broke his oath of support solely because Trump insulted his wife and his father. For Ted, this was personal, not business.
Ted could have told us it was personal last night. But he lied instead. He could have said something else, too.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking that Ted Cruz made Donald Trump look bad last night. And he did. Ted Cruz had a prime time speaking slot and he failed to endorse his party&amp;rsquo;s nominee for president. Hillary Clinton will use it.
A lot of people are saying Trump shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have invited him to speak unless Cruz agreed to endorse Trump. But Trump didn&amp;rsquo;t even ask for Cruz&amp;rsquo;s endorsement. Trump just offered Ted the prime time spot, and Ted took it.</description>

      <description>In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t hear, Donald Trump invited Ted Cruz to speak at the RNC in prime time with no expectation that Cruz would keep his word by endorsing Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz immediately accepted the prime time speaking spot.
In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t hear, Donald Trump waived his right to review Senator Cruz&amp;rsquo;s speech in advance, the first time that&amp;rsquo;s happened in our lifetimes according to Tucker Carlson. Mr. Trump respects Senator Cruz enough to let the senator say whatever he wants.</description>

      <description>You might think big embarrassing mistakes will get you fired, but they don&amp;rsquo;t. As long as you keep making different kinds of mistakes and your managers know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing (big &amp;ldquo;if&amp;rdquo;), you&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. Just don&amp;rsquo;t make the same kind of mistake over and over again. And it helps to work for a guy like Tom Watson or Donald Trump.

      <description>After years wasted as the press and politicians covered secondary matters, the major media have finally stepped up to address America&amp;rsquo;s deepest, most damaging problem. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about alleged plagiarism. And it&amp;rsquo;s about damn time.
While serious problems fester, the media and politicians waste precious time and energy covering the massacres of police officers by black militants and the slaughter of Bastille Day revelers by Islamic terrorists. Is it any wonder that 70 percent of Americans consider the country on the wrong track?</description>

      <description>Hillary, Obama, and much of the Democrat Party have fomented race hatred for years. They&amp;rsquo;ve ratcheted up their lies in recent months, hoping to turn race hatred into votes. They are that cynical and self-serving.
Now, Hillary and Obama have lost control of the fire they started. Crazed, racist murderers all across the country have declared war on police officers. From Dallas, Texas, to Ballwin, Missouri, to Baton Rouge, Louisianna, Hillary has sent a message that says it&amp;rsquo;s okay to kill a cop.</description>

 &amp;ndash;Kyle Cheney, Politico
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t even close, and I feel guilty.
I don&amp;rsquo;t look at Facebook too often. I have been on Facebook lately because it&amp;rsquo;s a great vehicle for book sales, but I really don&amp;rsquo;t like it.
One problem with Facebook is that I can see what people are thinking. And so many people I know and respect think some really dumb things.</description>

      <description>Good morning.
One of the reasons Trump will win in a landslide is safety. Trump has warned for years that we are weak and political correctness makes us weaker. Everybody knows he&amp;rsquo;s right. NeverTrumpers were saying this until Trump said it.
Last night,** a Muslim terrorist killed at least 84 people in Nice, France**. They were ordinary people lined up to watch fireworks, the same way you did on the 4th of July.</description>

      <description>I believe the greatest threat to human freedom and thriving is the political class. That smirking political class infects both Washington, DC, and Jefferson City, Missouri. And I believe only one candidate has the courage, the brains, and the commitment to destroy that political class in Missouri. That candidate is Eric Greitens.
Do you want to live as a slave to that smirking political class? Or do you want to live free and thrive?</description>

Ruth Bader Ginsburg, aka Notorious RBG, made aÂ wish last week. Being a lawyer, her wish came with a contingency.
I just launched a GoFund.Meproject to grant her that wish. And why not?
Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a true Horatio Alger story. Born to Russian-Jewish immigrant parents, raised in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, RBG rose the highest legal position in the United States: Supreme Court Justice.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;sÂ possible that some NeverTrumper has already gone there, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it.
Up until now, one complaint of the NeverTurmpers has been that Mr. Trump will hurt Republicans running for Senate, the House, and state offices. They make this claim knowing full well that Trump is ahead of Romney in every poll and with every demographic group. I predict that, come October, people will be saying Trump is virtually running unopposed.</description>

      <description>When a person declares himself &amp;ldquo;NeverTrump,&amp;rdquo; he thinks he&amp;rsquo;s making a political statement. Or a moral one. But he&amp;rsquo;s not. He&amp;rsquo;s making a psychological commitment that&amp;rsquo;s very difficult and painful to break.
Identity is the highest, most powerful form of persuasion. Identity also drives our decisions in parts of the brain we don&amp;rsquo;t really have conscious control over. I realize many conservatives reject brain science, but, for those of you who are open to learning, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain as best I can in a moment.</description>

Now we know: to be anti-Trump is to be pro-abortion and pro-race war.Â To be anti-Trump is to support violence against police officers, especially white police officers. That&amp;rsquo;s because Hillary is all those things, and to be anti-Trump is,Â logically, to be pro-Hillary. (If they both live until January 20, either Clinton or Trump will be the next president.</description>

      <description>His argument shocked me. I needed more time to think about it, so my response was weak. Maybe that was his intention. To knock me off my game. It worked, but for a very bad reason. I bet he&amp;rsquo;d like to take it back now, so pay close attention.
You, like me, probably know you&amp;rsquo;re not responsible for what anyone else does, and other people&amp;rsquo;s behavior doesn&amp;rsquo;t excuse your behavior. You agree with that, don&amp;rsquo;t you?</description>

That other person would deny he&amp;rsquo;s lying, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t he? If you accused him of lying, he&amp;rsquo;d fire off a series of defenses:
** It was a question, not a statement ** You didn&amp;rsquo;t say you weren&amp;rsquo;t going to buy the world&amp;rsquo;s largest dildo, did you? ** Can you prove you weren&amp;rsquo;t planning to get the world&amp;rsquo;s largest vibrating dildo?</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s play the imagine game. Imagine Comey decided to refer Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s crimes to the Department of Justice for prosecution. What would happen?
First, you&amp;rsquo;d never hear about it. The FBI and the DOJ don&amp;rsquo;t discuss active criminal investigations.</description>

Ed Martin Jr. and I got together again to talk about why you might give yourself Permission to Trump. It&amp;rsquo;s important that you do.
This week&amp;rsquo;s episode focuses on:
** FBI Director&amp;rsquo;s report on Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s illegal and dangerous abuse of classified information ** The horrific massacre of police officers in Dallas ** Bill&amp;rsquo;s new book,** Turning On Trump**

      <description>A lot of people seem to be mad at Trump. You might be one of them.
You probably think you know why youâre mad at him. For instance, you might not like what he said about the judge in a lawsuit heâs involved with. Or maybe you didnât like what he said about Rosie OâDonnell. You might even be mad that he said Saddam Hussein was a bad man who was good at killing terrorists.</description>

      <description>Many people grew up with dogs and backyards. If you are such a person, you probably remember being to told to make sure the gate&amp;rsquo;s shut and locked. Or maybe you were told not to use the gate at all because the dog might get out.
A lot of people who grew up with dogs suffered emotional trauma when something bad happened to their dog. Imagine how you&amp;rsquo;d feel if you were seven or eight and you left the gate open and the dog got out and got hit by a car.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, ISIS is on a roll.
What a week! NearlyÂ 200 murders across three countries onÂ two continents. Not bad for a JV team, huh? Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the week:

      <description>Think about the word &amp;ldquo;news.&amp;rdquo; In a moment, I&amp;rsquo;m going to ask you more questions about the news. Before that, though, you probably heard about the terrible terrorist attack in Istanbul, Turkey. Dozens killed, scores injured. &amp;ldquo;It was like hell,&amp;rdquo; one witness recalled.
Where did you get news of this latest terrorist attack? Facebook? Television? Radio?
Do you remember what you were doing when you heard the news? Take a moment to think back to when you first heard the news.</description>

      <description>Pat Buchanan and George Will have a lot in common, but they&amp;rsquo;re very different, too. They&amp;rsquo;re both conservative writers and journalists. But Buchanan&amp;rsquo;s an activist while Will is a passivist. (New word?) Let me explain.
When I was a freshman in college, a professor told me he saw George Will speak. He found Will&amp;rsquo;s conservatism &amp;ldquo;intellectual and reasonable,&amp;rdquo; unlike Ronald Regan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;extremism.&amp;rdquo; It was a shot at my Reaganism. I knew it.</description>

      <description>When the BBC called Brexit for LEAVE at about 12:30 a.m. CDT today, I thought first of my friend Mike Flynn. Mike had a keen sense of history. He put the Tea Party movement into proper perspective, as he did with all events.Â Mike kept us from overstating both the Tea Party&amp;rsquo;s effect and its potential. Or he put them in context and reminded us that our potential depends on ourselves, not outside forces.</description>

      <description>As an American, I am proud of the people from whose loins our nation sprang. United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union. The Brits rejected globalist, elitist threats and insults to vote for independence. Like America did in 1776.
Savor this moment in history. You were alive to see a nation reject foreign tyranny. Every Brit who voted LEAVE showed courage and love of freedom. God bless them all.</description>

 The Republican leadership in Congress doesnât have the guts to go to the floor of the Senate or the floor of the House and make these charges. This is outstanding. You canât let Hillary Clinton get away with her corruption, her cronyism, her criminality. I donât care who you support or donât support. Sheâs detestable.

These are realÂ tweets from real people with one word changed. I replaced &amp;ldquo;Trump&amp;rdquo; in the original tweets with &amp;ldquo;Hillary.&amp;rdquo; You can see these death-happy tweets and many, many more on Breitbart.com.

      <description>Some people say they&amp;rsquo;re afraid of Donald Trump for bizarre reasons. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard he&amp;rsquo;s a dictator, a fascist, a genocidal maniac, and a lousy businessman. If any of that is true, there&amp;rsquo;s no evidence of it, so he must also own all the media already. And the internet. In fact, if Trump is a lousy businessman who managed to bungle his way to a $10 billion fortune, he must really bad at dictatoring, because he hasn&amp;rsquo;t even conquered his home country in 70 years.</description>

      <description>You knew it would happen, didn&amp;rsquo;t you?
Corey Lewandowski, the obscure, small-potatoes political operative from a tiny state couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly run a presidential campaign from start to victory, could he?
But this isn&amp;rsquo;t about Corey Lewandowski. It&amp;rsquo;s about the next the president of the United States, Donald Trump. And you&amp;rsquo;ll want to read it all because it&amp;rsquo;s so true. So true.
I read a summary of what happened at Lewandowski&amp;rsquo;s dismissal meeting, and it sounded exactly like an episode of The Apprentice.</description>

See, I experiment with every writing tool I hear about, and I stick with the ones that measurably improve my writing. Especially when they work as I write (because I hate editing and revision, as you can tell).</description>

The man was sentenced to six months in jail and three years&amp;rsquo; probation. Many people were outraged by the sentence, but no one told the woman she needs to do some soul searching,Â did they?
But why not? Why not ask the woman to reflect on her actions and things she might have said.</description>

This morning, just as I was taking a break to catch up on news, I got a text from a friend that drew me to a particular post on GP. The headline:
After the Pulse Club Massacre, It&amp;rsquo;s Time for Gays to Come Home to Republican Party In it, my friend Jim Hoft, co-founder of St.</description>

      <description>With the Islamic massacre at a gay club in Orlando, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of talk about jihad and guns. The Gateway Pundit does a great job of keeping you informed. So you don&amp;rsquo;t need me adding noise. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about statistics, which everybody loves.
There are about 320 million people in the United States. About one percent are Muslims. By comparison, about 2.5 percent of Americans are Jewish. It&amp;rsquo;s safe to say, then, that there are about 2.</description>

      <description>Trump is now running unopposed for president because his only opponent is an empty pantsuit.
Hillary Clinton uses other people&amp;rsquo;s money to surround herself with nearly 1,000 paid staff. Direct paid staff. That a HUGE support team for a crooked sexist like Hillary.
Donald Trump spends his own money, so he hires only enough people to get the job done. Trump understands money and people, while Hillary understands comfort.
Tonight, Hillary Clinton exposed herself as an amateur in the world of communication.</description>

      <description>A lot of people are mad at Paul Ryan. Millions of people want Mr. Ryan to step down as Speaker of the House. I am not mad at him. Paul Ryan is a victim of his circumstances, just like a lot of other Republicans.
Paul Ryan stepped up to a microphone this week and said what he was programmed to say. Essentially, Mr. Ryan said he&amp;rsquo;s not happy with Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s statements about a La Raza judge who started issuing anti-Trump rulings after Trump called on America to enforce its immigration laws.</description>

      <description>Republicans hate race.Â RaceÂ has been bad for the GOP ever since Republicans passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See, Lyndon Johnson was a Democrat, and he proposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Most Democrats violently opposed the bill. But most Republicans supported it. The bill passed, of course, and it survived many Supreme Court challenges.
The Civil Rights Act&amp;rsquo;s aim was to wring racist behavior out of American life.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard the news that Donald Trump believes it&amp;rsquo;s possible for a Muslim judge to treat him unfairly. Do you think Trump is wrong about this?
When asked by a reporter if Trump believed it would be possible for a Muslim judge to treat him unfairly, Trump answered, &amp;ldquo;Itâs possible, yes. Yeah. That would be possible, absolutely.&amp;rdquo;
Notice that Trump didn&amp;rsquo;t say, &amp;ldquo;all Muslim judges are unfair to me.&amp;rdquo; Nor did he say all Hispanic judges are unfair.</description>

      <description>Has any judge, anywhere, ever presided unfairly over a trial?
The leftist press is making hay over Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s reasonable assertion that a Muslim judge might not be able to fairly adjudicate a case involving Trump.
The answer to my opening question is &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo; Many judges have presided unfairlyÂ over trials. For example, many blacks were sent to prison when the same evidence would have exonerated a white defendant. We all know that.</description>

      <description>Do you want to know what Trump supporters are thinking? Many people do.
If you supported Ted Cruz, you might not understand how the guy who wrote The Conservative Manifesto in 1993 could support Trump.
If you supported Marco Rubio or Ben Carson last year, how do you reconcile your convictions with Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s bizarre life?
Is Donald Trump a conservative or not?

      <description>I admire David French, David French is running for president, but you probably have no idea who he is, right?
No, it&amp;rsquo;s not Buffy and Jody&amp;rsquo;s man-nanny from the 1960s sitcom Family Affair. That was Mr. French played by Sebastian Cabot, and I forget the character&amp;rsquo;s first name.
Nor is it the guy who publishes most stage play scripts. That&amp;rsquo;s Samuel French. (OnlyÂ theatre people will know that name.)
If you&amp;rsquo;re a hard-core conservative or you read National Review for any reason, you might have heard of David French.</description>

      <description>The god of Memorial Day is Janus, looking to the future as well as the past.
Memorial Day looks back, but it also warns of something coming. The list of war dead is incomplete. It always will be.
Each generation looks at its wars and finds something final, but the end never comes. Memorials never end while man roams the earth.
When I see the Vietnam Memorial, with its rows and ranks of lost warriors, I see, too, the invisible ledger that stretches to the horizon.</description>

      <description>Try not to imagine the worldwide television audience for the Trump vs. Sanders debate. Super Bowl ratings would look skimpy by comparison. Trump vs. Sanders would be the most watched political event ever. And I&amp;rsquo;m including the future in &amp;ldquo;ever.&amp;rdquo; And a Trump vs. Sanders debate would effectively kill Democrats&amp;rsquo; chances in November. This is huge.
Yesterday, I wrote about Trump&amp;rsquo;s remarkable honesty at his press conference, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the big story of the day.</description>

      <description>Donald Trump just exploded the heads of professional talkers on CNN. It was honestly funny.
Trump reached 1,237 delegates today, clinching the nomination of the Republican Party. He will be the 45th President of the United States, and his press conferences will be the most popular show on television. It will be huge, believe me. And after the press conference, Trump did something that might have sealed the deal with American voters.</description>

      <description>After the 1998 Rams season, I walked into City Limits bar or Brothers bar or whatever its name was then. It&amp;rsquo;s a strip mall bar in Wildwood. Cindy Schuenke was tending bar, and we started talking about the Rams&amp;rsquo; dismal season. She said they were hopeless, but I disagreed. &amp;ldquo;They are four players away,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;A quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a defensive end.&amp;rdquo;
Later in the year, but before the season, the Rams acquired Trent Green (and Kurt Warner) at QB, Marshall Faulk at RB, Adam Timmermann at offensive guard, and Grant Wistrom moved up to start at defensive end.</description>

      <description>Watch what people do and say because action comes before opinion.
People write &amp;ldquo;President Trump&amp;rdquo; three times as much as they write &amp;ldquo;President Clinton.&amp;rdquo; For every one person who writes &amp;ldquo;President Trump&amp;rdquo; in a column, blog, tweet, or Facebook post, hundreds of thousands more say or think &amp;ldquo;President Trump&amp;rdquo; every day.
That&amp;rsquo;s howÂ I predicted Trump winning by a landslide. I watched what people say and do.
A lot of people who subconsciously think &amp;ldquo;President Trump&amp;rdquo; will touch the screen or check the box or pull the lever for Trump when they step inside the voting booth.</description>

      <description>Say what you want about Donald Trump, the customer service at his properties is insanely great. And The Donald personally sets the standard for that service. He also inspects it, and he has a sick level of attention to detail. Donald Trump doesn&amp;rsquo;t miss a thing when it comes to providing a perfect environment for his guests and residents.
The opposite is true of the TSA. Like most government-run operations, the TSA sucks at customer service.</description>

[Tweet &amp;ldquo;CatchÂ yourself saying &amp;lsquo;President Trump&amp;rsquo; now? @realDonaldTrump&amp;rdquo;]
It&amp;rsquo;s common during election years for pundits to occasionally say &amp;ldquo;President So-and-so,&amp;rdquo; usually sarcastically. And some &amp;ldquo;President Trump&amp;rdquo; talk is sarcastic. But most of this President Trump talk is subconscious prediction.

      <title>How Conservatives Abandoned Principles Over Trump</title>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably been hearing a lot about &amp;ldquo;principles&amp;rdquo; lately. Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s entire campaign centered &amp;ldquo;conservative principles&amp;rdquo; and being a &amp;ldquo;principled conservative.&amp;rdquo;
Lately, though, most of that &amp;ldquo;principles&amp;rdquo; talk is about how Donald Trump has caused good conservatives to abandon their principles.
Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s true. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to believe it.
The one principle that many conservatives have abandoned and encouraged others to abandon: keeping your word.
The lead advocate for abandoning this principle of keeping one&amp;rsquo;s word is Jonah Goldberg of National Review and the American Enterprise Institute.</description>

      <description>You mightÂ have noticed that my predictions have been remarkably accurate lately, have you not?
For example, on Sunday, May 1, I predicted Ted Cruz would suspend his campaign after getting trounced in Indiana. Two days later, Cruz lost the Indiana primary to Donald Trump 53 to 36. At the time I wrote, many pundits and pollster still believed Cruz could win that Indiana race, and everyone believed Cruz was telling the truth when he said repeatedly he was staying in the race to Cleveland unless Trump reached 1,237 delegates before then.</description>

      <description>Nothing happens in politics by accident. Every move has an angle. Some players are better than others. Paul Ryan and Donald Trump are two of the best players alive, but one is better than the other. We&amp;rsquo;ll see that tomorrow.
House Speaker Paul Ryan has set aside Thursday for meetings with his party&amp;rsquo;s nominee for President. Every nominee for president meets with the senior members of his party&amp;rsquo;s Congressional caucus, so there&amp;rsquo;s nothing odd about the meeting.</description>

If they succeed in defeating Trump, they will be culpable in many, many abortions. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of guilt for a guy like Erickson to carry around, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?
Chances are Congress won&amp;rsquo;t introduce any major abortion laws in the next four years. That means the abortion battle will remain in the courts.</description>

      <description>People think they&amp;rsquo;re rational, but we&amp;rsquo;reÂ not. For example, on manyÂ issues,** Trump&amp;rsquo;s positions are almost identical to Ronald Reagan&amp;rsquo;s.** When it comes to abortion, trade, taxes, foreign policy and the military, and entitlements like Social Security, you can&amp;rsquo;t fit a dime between Reagan and Trump.
So why do people see Trump as far to the left of Reagan?
Contrasts and comparisons.
Reagan ran against George Bush and John B. Anderson.</description>

      <description>Every prediction about Trump has been wrong. Except for two. Ann Coulter and Scott Adams predicted Trump would win the nomination and, eventually, the White House in a landslide. They were right.
World leaders expect Trump to win, and they are lining up to make all his crazy assertions look like brilliant predictions.
Former Mexico president Vicente Fox apologized to Trump, and Trump graciously accepted. That&amp;rsquo;s a sign that Mexicans expect Trump to become the next US president.</description>

TheNR Against Trump writers can own it if Hillary wins and appoints a Supreme Court justice who&amp;rsquo;s to the left of Bader-Ginsberg as Scalia&amp;rsquo;s replacement.Â They&amp;rsquo;ll take thatÂ to their graves.
For me, I&amp;rsquo;m for Trump. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit he wasn&amp;rsquo;t my first choice, but he was far from my last choice. My first choice, Ben Carson, endorsed The Donald.</description>

      <description>I have no idea who will win the Indiana primary 72 hours from the time I write. But the people inside Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s campaign seem to have an idea. And it&amp;rsquo;s not good for them. Cruz&amp;rsquo;s top team expects their candidate to lose. And Senator Cruz seems to have accepted that outcome.
Expectations Matter More Than Preferences Regular readers know that polls that ask &amp;ldquo;who do you think will win&amp;rdquo; trump polls that ask &amp;ldquo;who do you intend to vote for&amp;rdquo; or even &amp;ldquo;who did you vote for?</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably found yourself saying words like &amp;ldquo;rigged&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;collusion&amp;rdquo; recently. They&amp;rsquo;ve become sexy words, haven&amp;rsquo;t they. That&amp;rsquo;s because Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s made rigged and collusion household words. He&amp;rsquo;s put them in your head.
You might even use them wrong. &amp;ldquo;There was a collusion on highway forty-four.&amp;rdquo; Or &amp;ldquo;I rigged my shorts.&amp;rdquo; (BTW, Hillary sounds weak and hoarse, doesn&amp;rsquo;t she? Grating.)
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed yourself saying rigged and collusion, pay attention tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s regress in time to the 1980s.
Remember C. Everett Koop, the Surgeon-General who launched the Safe Sex movement? Koop wanted to curtail the spread of AIDS.Â The Safe Sex movement started slowly and originally focused on non-monogamous gay men. By 1987, though, everyone was doing it. (Or not doing &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; as the case may be.) A February 17, 1987 New York Times headline declared &amp;ldquo;Safe Sex Movement Gains Favor Among Heterosexuals.</description>

Your work is done, now, so you sit in your favorite outdoor chair and take in the relaxing, comfortable view. Smell the freshness of spring wildflowers.</description>

Folks, this is the war we&amp;rsquo;re fighting. It&amp;rsquo;s the war that pits innovation against entrenched incumbents. It&amp;rsquo;s the too small to survive against too big to fail. And it&amp;rsquo;s the reason we call ourselves conservatives.

      <description>I was a pretender.
In 2012, I pretended I believed Mitt Romney would win. But I knew better. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the heart to tell the truth to the volunteers banging doors and working call lists from our election office in South County.
But I knew Romney would lose. I suspected the GOP would not regain the Senate.
When some of our hardest workers showed up to help break down the office and move our belongings, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t look at them.</description>

      <description>That was a strategic kill-shot, to borrow Scott Adams&amp;rsquo;s word. And it changes everything for conservatives.
After a so-so debate performance and in the middle of a 16-hour verbal assault from Marco Rubio, Trump went nuclear. But not the way everyone would expect Trump to go nuclear.
Trump didn&amp;rsquo;t need to invent a brilliant new put-down line to counter Marco. Instead, he calmly introduced Chris Christie to 10,000 fans in Texas.</description>

      <description>The world is about to end.
Or civil war is about to break out in Dayton, Ohio.
Believe it?
Glenn Beck, Erick Erickson, and other Republicans have convinced a lot of people that we are doomed ifÂ Donald Trump wins the Republican nomination. I know some people who are nearly incapacitated with fear and grief after last night&amp;rsquo;s Nevada caucuses. Because they listen to Glenn Beck. Sad!

      <description>Glenn Beck was pretty sure that God killed Antonin Scalia so Ted Cruz would win the presidency.
Glenn Beck&amp;rsquo;s theology is very different from mine.
In 2010, I worried that Glenn Beck was doing more harm than good. For days, I&amp;rsquo;d watched Beck tell his watchers that the world was ending and they would be crushed. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I wrote:
 Beck offers no solutions.Â At least, he hasnât in the past two days.</description>

      <description>You might have heard that State Senator Dave Schatz gutted ethics reform in Missouri. According to Ryan Johnson of Missouri Alliance for Freedom:
 Cleaning up the practice of Jefferson Cityâs revolving door is the reason for Rep. Caleb RowdenâsÂ House Bill 1979Â (carried in the Senate by Sen. Bob Onder). It puts in place a one year cooling off period that will make legislators sit out for at least a year before lobbying.</description>

      <description>Ted Cruz has a powerful strategy available to him. This strategy could not only determine the winner of the Republican convention but put Cruz in position to influence policy for generations.
But it&amp;rsquo;s probably not what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to lay out some assumptions, many of which you could disagree with. That&amp;rsquo;s okay. But for the purposes of this post, let&amp;rsquo;s stipulate:

Iâm with Apple on this one.
This back door would allow the FBI to access the content of the San Bernardino terroristsâ phone, possibly exposing more terrorists. That would be a good thing.
But Apple never built a back door to the iPhone because no one can control the keys to such portals. If Apple builds it, every government spy agency in the world will be able to read your texts, see where youâve been, and listen to your phone calls.</description>

I can only assume the Pope has secretly cut a deal with The Donald.
&amp;ldquo;Pope. Donald here. I need you to give me some crap about the wall.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Si.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Just, uh, call me a Muslim or something. Make it look sincere, ya know?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Si.&amp;rdquo;
So the Pope stands at the U.S.-Mexico border and says anyone who wants to build a wall &amp;ldquo;is not a Christian.</description>

      <description>How people responded to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post, Maybe he&amp;rsquo;s not a conservative, varied. But there were two dominant types.
Surface thinkers ignored most of the content. I warned you about this early on. I decided against a deep examination of conservatism because people don&amp;rsquo;t care. Instead, I wrote a rather tongue-in-cheek story about why definitions of conservatism don&amp;rsquo;t matter.
Deep thinkers got the tongue-in-cheek shtick. Maybe they rolled their eyes at my cheap attempt at being clever.</description>

      <description>As far as I can tell, the number one reason a few conservatives give for hating Eric Greitens is that he might not be a conservative. He&amp;rsquo;s probably not. But that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t make any difference.
Figuring out whether Greitens is a conservative or not requires a lot of thinking, a lot of writing, and a lot of clear analysis from readers. I won&amp;rsquo;t waste time on the first two because I won&amp;rsquo;t get the last no matter what.</description>

I also learned that Eric Greitens has some really stupid opponents. Cowardly, stupid weasels. Cowardly because Greitens&amp;rsquo;s opponents funded, produced, and promoted an anonymous video, packed with lies. Stupid because that video so infuriated Missouri&amp;rsquo;s 500,000 military veterans that Greitens is picking up new supporters.</description>

The human brain is very bad at looking to the future.
It&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to imagine a living person not being here. We naturally assume the future will be a linear progression of the recent past.
Then one of five conservative Supreme Court justices dies. And everything&amp;rsquo;s thrown into chaos.
We have only eleven months until a new president takes the oath of office.</description>

      <description>I re-read Ronald Reagan&amp;rsquo;s announcement speech the other day.
Delivered November 13, 1979, these are the words that launched the greatest presidency of my lifetime.
Notice the natural humanity in Reagan&amp;rsquo;s words. He didn&amp;rsquo;t browbeat people with abstract concepts like the Constitution or liberty. Instead, he spoke about the real lives of ordinary Americans. And the everyday life of an America that lived up to its ideal. And notice the complete lack of pomposity, vanity, and vulgarity so prevalent in the frontrunners of 2016.</description>

      <description>I am Catholic.
I believe in and trust the magisterium of the church.
Nothing distinguishes me from Protestants more profoundly than that concept: the magisterium, or the teaching authority, of the church.
For me, the church is like Locke and Jefferson and Madison. They were learned men who read Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, Cato, Epictetus, Epicurus, and other Greek and Roman philosophers, often in the original languages.
Those philosophical and political founders interpreted and organized ancient philosophy for England and America.</description>

      <description>Leverage: donât make deals without it.
 &amp;ndash;Donald Trump, The Art of the Deal, 1987
It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to go Machiavellian during primaries. Even during general elections after primaries. But there&amp;rsquo;s a great danger for the grassroots.
**If we don&amp;rsquo;t hold candidates accountable during the race when we have all the leverage, how can we possibly hold office-holders accountable?Â **
Check out this paragraph from the Washington Post:
   Cruz offered a lawyerly defense of his campaignâs actions, blaming media reporting for the mistake.</description>

But first . . .
Disclosure 1: Before I get to the Master Manipulator Model, some important background. I work professionally in the field of persuasion and influence. I even invented a workshop that helps bigÂ companies make their stuff more persuasive.
The point is, I study persuasion, and manipulation is persuasion&amp;rsquo;s cousin.</description>

      <description>The polls were wrong. But that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the biggest shock.
The big shock was . . . who was that guy pretending to be Donald Trump?
Millions and millions of people waited to watch The Donald melt down after finishing second behind Ted Cruz.
But it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. Instead, Trump managed to show humility and graciousness without giving up his signature bravado. Pretty brilliant. As Romney and Rove learned in 2012, though, air power will not win many races.</description>

I was in Washington, DC, over the weekend when it dawned on me that we on the right were probably wrong about Obama&amp;rsquo;s thirst for dictatorial power. Or maybe we were right, but seven years of near-dictatorial power have exhausted the would-be autocrat. He certain looks worn down, as this Time magazine side-by-side shows:

      <description>This &amp;ldquo;VOTING VIOLATION&amp;rdquo; controversyÂ says bad things about the Cruz campaign.
(BTW, Rubio&amp;rsquo;s campaign sent a similar, but less creepy, mailer, too. So far, I have not seen a large number of complaints about the Rubio mailer.)
And I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the ethics of publicly shaming people who vote sporadically. I&amp;rsquo;m talking two gross electioneering violations from a campaign that markets itself as the most scientifically advanced in history. With the mailer Team Cruz showed a lack of strategic understanding of the science and compounded their ignorance by apparently making up numbers.</description>

I gotta tell ya, the people at Fox News are stupid. Dumb. Ignorant. Pliable. Oafish. Any word you want you to use that means cognitively challenged (for the politically correct).
But the Fox Newsmorons have a lot of company at National Review.
Trump is playing these media elites like a fiddle.

 &amp;ndash;Thomas Jefferson to WilliamÂ Short, 1825.
National Review has entered dangerous territory: they have inadvertently made the case for Trump.
An angry screed by Kevin Williamson titled &amp;ldquo;Our Post-Literate Politics&amp;rdquo; (later renamed to &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s a Book?&amp;quot;) makes the case that Trump supporters are illiterate, uneducated, dim-witted, racist, homophobes.

      <description>Reading two excellent articles by Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight (here and here), I remembered a thought that passed through my mind last Friday.
After reading some of National Review&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Against Trump&amp;rdquo; issue,I wroteÂ blog post. To me the NR issue showed the magazine is out of touch with voters. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about traditional, reliable, motivated, and informed primary voters.** I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the broader pool of voters who vote in general elections every four, eight, or twelve years** and occasionally in local elections.</description>

      <description>**Expectations matter most in how undecided voters decide.Â **
It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand how late-deciders tend to vote. This knowledge (especially in Iowa and New Hampshire) could decide the outcome.
Primary voters tend to decide whom to for at the last minute.
In 2008, 16 percent of voters said they made their choice on election day. Which means we have a long way to go to know how Iowa will turn out.</description>

I agree with Ted Cruz. And welcome Big Government readers.
Senator Cruz said,Â &amp;ldquo;Katrina Pierson is an utterly fearless principled conservative.&amp;rdquo;
That was just two years ago. Katrina Pierson was challenging Pete Sessions for Congress.
I also agree with Ted&amp;rsquo;s dad, Rafael Cruz, who said of Katrina, &amp;ldquo;Sheâs a strict constitutionalist.</description>

The conservative war against Trump won&amp;rsquo;t work.
I get why National Review and The Weekly Standard devote whole issues of magazines to Trump&amp;rsquo;s lack of conservative bonafides. I appreciate it. Their work is important. **But theirÂ tactic will prove completely useless in defeating Trump.Â **In fact, the fight is already over, and the cover story proves it.
Conservative magazines&amp;ndash;online or on paper&amp;ndash;are supposed to weigh events and people against conservative principles and pass judgment.</description>

Those who identify themselves with the people, have confidence in them, cherish and consider them as the most honest and safe, although not the most wise depositary of the public interests. In every country these two parties exist, and in every one where they are free to think, speak, and write, they will declare themselves.</description>

Before Star Wars, the 1970s were about killer sharks, towering infernos, earthquakes, and capsized cruise ships.
Psychologists and sociologistsÂ attributed the genre&amp;rsquo;s popularity to the people&amp;rsquo;s need to assimilate nuclear holocaust.
I think the movies were just good, cathartic entertainment.

The acrimony created by Kroenke&amp;rsquo;s relocation request letter makes the situation in St. Louis untenable for the team and its owner. In short, Kroenke calls St. Louis a second-rate, economically depressed, crime-infest toilet of a city full of people so obsessed with baseball that no other sports franchise has the ability to compete for entertainment dollars.</description>

Social psychologists and usability experts both know that people&amp;rsquo;s words often conflict with their actions. This is especially true when asking people to predict their own behavior in a hypothetical.
For example, one study asked people to predict whether they would buy flowers for a charity. Eight-three percent of respondents said, &amp;ldquo;yes I would,&amp;rdquo; but only 43 percent actually did.</description>

If you have a Missouri drivers license or ID card but you do not have a passport or military ID, bring your Social Security card or your birth certificate.
That&amp;rsquo;s the word I got from Navy Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes.
The Department of Homeland Security informed Missouri last week that our state&amp;rsquo;s drivers licenses and ID cards will no longer serve as identification at federal agencies after January 10, 2016.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, in the days of sundials and pendulum clocks, people needed a way toÂ agree on the time. For instance, if my watch says 11:13 and your watch says 1:32, who&amp;rsquo;s right?
One way to coordinate time in a city or a sea port was a time ball placed somewhere highly visible. People could use the ball to set their pocket watches, and use their pocket watches to set their other clocks.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What was the biggest adjustment for you going from the military to the business world?&amp;rdquo;
Several people have asked me that question, and my answer always surprises them.
&amp;ldquo;In the military,&amp;rdquo; I say, &amp;ldquo;every individual has a lot moreÂ latitude and authority to act. In the business world, no one can do anything without explicit instructions.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Really? I thought it would be the other way around,&amp;rdquo; they say.
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s the popular culture, but the truth is one-hundred eighty degrees the other way.</description>

      <description>A couple weeks ago, the blog Progressives Today ran an attack piece on Eric Greitens for two of his donors (link). The piece generated of lot angst and fury on the right side of social media.
**Turns out the story was pretty shoddy journalism. **
Progressives Today didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to look at the Pritzkers&amp;rsquo; other donations or the military museum they founded. If they had, they&amp;rsquo;d know that Jennifer N. Pritzker (formerly James N.</description>

      <description>Five for five.
The first five people who told me they supported Trump in 2015 also supported Ross Perot in 1992.
I realize it&amp;rsquo;s a tiny sample size. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that Donald Trump is the reincarnation of H. Ross Perot. Conservatives&amp;ndash;all conservatives and all center-right voters&amp;ndash;need to come to terms with that fact. We must also deal with the realities of the 2016 election and chooseÂ a strategy.</description>

Capitalists are like children and free marketers are like their parents.
If the free marketers neglect their duties to feed, protect, teach, and discipline capitalists, some well-meaning but inept government agency will impose itself into the parenting role, destroying the lives of everyone involved and wasting trillions of tax dollars (borrowed from future generations) in the process.</description>

      <description>The UN is a game with many players.
The UN makes money by convincing member nations that the costs of funding the UN are less than the costs of not funding it.
The UN wants to grow as large as possible, like any organization or organism or rear end.
The UN is already very large. Its last budget was $5.4 billion, and that represented a 2.9 percent reduction from the previous two years.</description>

Syed Farook and four or five others worked long hours in Farookâs San Bernardino garage for months leading up to a deadly Islamic terror attack last week.
Neighbors knew. They knew Farook and his Pakistani wife, Tashfeen Malik, were up to no good. But the neighbors said nothing until after the massacre at a center for the developmentally disabled.

      <description>Thanksgiving celebrates the Pilgrims&amp;rsquo; break from socialism.
Schools and textbooks avoid the topic, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth remembering. The Plymouth and Jamestown plantations were dying under &amp;ldquo;common store&amp;rdquo; approach. Only by establishing a free market did the settlers thrive.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of Kent Dillon&amp;rsquo;s excellent story of Thanksgiving, which you can continue reading in its entirety at The Mises Institute:
By Kent Dillon
 The celebration of Thanksgiving is a celebration of plenty and appreciation of the abundance that has characterized the free enterprise, individualistic, capitalistic systems of the US.</description>

Leaving aside the question of security and vetting for the refugees, why does Francis Slay want so desperately to host more people who have no jobs, no language, and little hope of flourishing in a city that, on most measures, is failing.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Lee Presser made a great point in this guest post, The Only Rule of Engagement Will Be Victory. As one commenter noted:
 This is the best analysis of the war on terror that I have read. If we do not fight to win, we shouldnât be in the fight. Winning the war on terror starts with 1) admitting there is a war on terror, 2) being willing to confront the enemy with force, 3) fighting to win the war rather than appease the enemy, and 4) do whatever it takes to protect Americans and their homeland.</description>

      <description>In the war on terror, youâre on our side or theirs.
Barack Obama announced that he will veto any attempt by Congress to require background checks of Syrian refugees in an attempt to weed out ISIS terrorists. The President&amp;rsquo;s allegiances are now clear.
I heard Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) say that we must ensure proper screening in the wake of last Fridayâs Islamic terrorist attack in Paris.
The House of Representatives is working on legislation to do just that: increase the likelihood that we will catch terrorist infiltraters before they reach American soil.</description>

      <description>Viva la France This week, let&amp;rsquo;s say a special prayer for the people of France. And the whole world.
Mayor Slay About to Change Tune on Refugees On September 11, St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay announced plans to acceptÂ 10,000 non-ChristianÂ Syrian refugees to St. Louis. After the coordinated attacks by ISIS terrorists in Paris on Friday, expect the mayor come under intense pressure to change plans. News that at least one of the Paris attackers entered France from Serbia as a Syrian war refugee will only intensify the pressure on Slay.</description>

You can&amp;rsquo;t make this stuff up.
Concerned Student 1950, the group that seized public ground for private use at the University of Missouri has a new concern today. It seems the kiddos are upset that ISIS deigned to steal the headlines by killing 120 to 150 people in Paris, wounding 200 others.</description>

      <description>Disclosure: I am Irish.
I know the politically correct way to say it is Irish-American. The accurate way to say it is American of Irish descent.
But I grew up in South St. Louis where we were just Irish. And the Italians were Italian and the Germans were German. (That&amp;rsquo;s about all we had in my neighborhood, plus a few Jewish converts to Catholicism, but they caucused with the Germans.)</description>

      <description>Ben Carson The press can&amp;rsquo;t find people who will corroborate Ben Carson&amp;rsquo;s low opinion of himself as a young man. And somehow we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to believe that reflect poorly on Dr. Carson. It reflects poorly on journalism, for sure, but it actually shows that people who knew Dr. Carson won&amp;rsquo;t speak ill of him. Nice problem to have.

      <description>A few Mizzou football players announced they&amp;rsquo;re boycotting all sports activities until University of Missouri system presidentÂ Tim Wolfe quits or is fired. Considering the football team&amp;rsquo;s dismal performance, the cynic in me wonders if sitting out might help the players&amp;rsquo;Â chances of gettingÂ an NFL draft.
The players and other African-AmericanÂ students at Mizzou believe they are victims of &amp;ldquo;systematic oppression&amp;rdquo; and they want Tim Wolfe to fix it simply by resigning.</description>

      <description>I am wrong a lot.
When I was 25, I was wrong a lot, too.
The difference between 1988 and 2015 is not that I&amp;rsquo;m particularly smarter now, but that I&amp;rsquo;m used to being wrong. Somewhere along life&amp;rsquo;s journey, I realized two things:
*1. Being wrong isn&amp;rsquo;t the end of the world. *2. Being wrong is the beginning of learning.
When I was 25, I refused to admit being wrong about anything.</description>

      <description>When Jim Cramer asks a question, you know everything&amp;rsquo;s all boogered up.
The first hour of the GOP Presidential Debate from Colorado will go down as the first official event of the post-journalism world. The debate ended with John Harwood lying about the debate&amp;rsquo;s length. Having been an occasional guest of Larry Kudlow, I&amp;rsquo;m being nice. But the CNBC reporters couldn&amp;rsquo;t write a story for my high school newspaper.
On the substance of what the candidates said, this was the best debate so far.</description>

      <description>What has 50 years of loyalty to Democrats won for African-Americans?
If you answered &amp;ldquo;civil rights legislation,&amp;rdquo; you better look at who voted for the laws and who opposed. (Hint: Republicans yea, Democrats nay.)
Welfare? In 1967 the poverty rate was 14 percent. In 2014, the poverty rate was 14 percent. In the interim, we pissed away $22 trillion on bureaucratic sex junkets to Costa Rica and massive government office buildings in every major city.</description>

      <description>Maybe Ann Wagner&amp;rsquo;s the problem.
Rep. Ann Wagner (HA-64) is the House Majority Whip. Her job is to know how every GOP member will vote on bills and to cut deals until House leadership gets the numbers it wants.
It&amp;rsquo;s unfathomable that a majority whip would not have seen the Kevin McCarthy meltdown coming long before the House Republican caucus met to nominate a candidate for speaker. But many accounts suggest that the Republican House leadership thought McCarthy had the votes up to the moment he withdrew.</description>

      <description>Uber X St. Louis rolled into existence on Friday.
No, Uber did not win the Metropolitan Taxicab Commission&amp;rsquo;s permission to operate. Instead, the ride-sharing service filed a federal anti-trade suit against the MTC.
In the first weekend, Uber X provided over 5,000 rides, mostly from people leaving bars between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. In other words, by defying the MTC, Uber X kept 5,000 drunk drivers off the road.</description>

      <description>What did Jefferson mean by âpursuit of happinessâ as an unalienable right?
If youâve heard it was a substitute for âpropertyâ because Jefferson feared Southerners would equate property with slaves, you heard wrong.
For weeks I have repeated a foundational belief of conservatism: every person deserves the dignity of meaningful work and the freedom to pursue happiness.
But what does it mean to pursue happiness? What did Jefferson mean? And why did Locke consider pursuit of happiness essential to liberty?</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I missed this.
It&amp;rsquo;s the story of Marienthal Austria.
Marienthal was a town in Austria that thrived thanks to a single employer. When the flax millÂ went out of business in 1932, Marienthal&amp;rsquo;s population became mostly unemployed.
Thanks to Austria&amp;rsquo;s liberal unemployment programs that replaced up to 90 percent of income, no one in Marienthal plunged into economic poverty as a result of the mill&amp;rsquo;s closing. But spiritual poverty was another story.</description>

      <description>Why is government involved in marriage at all? Taxes.
Brian Bollmann makes an excellent point about same-sex marriage.
Brian points out in this post that marriage is not a matter for government; contract law is. Government&amp;rsquo;s only concern in the case of a marriage is with its contractual implications:
 At some point in the short history of the United States (and certainly after the Civil War), state governments stepped onto the wall of separation and began getting involved in the religious institution of marriage in the appropriate area of protecting the rights to property â especially that of women.</description>

I hear she&amp;rsquo;s losing a lot of support from Democrat Party insiders, at least in private. The DNC is meeting this week, and talk will likely surround an alternative Democrats can vote for.
While Republicans enjoy the Clinton meltdown, we might want to be careful what we wish for.
One of the GOP&amp;rsquo;s best hopes for the White House is voter enthusiasm. Republicans can&amp;rsquo;t wait to vote, Democrats dread it.</description>

      <description>There seems to be a certain air of inevitability that Trump will win the GOP nomination for President. According to a new poll, 57 percent of Republican voters expect that Trump will be the party&amp;rsquo;s candidate next year. Why is that important?
Expectations Beat Preferences It&amp;rsquo;s important because expectations are far better predictors of actual winners than preference polls. From a 2012 NY Times story by David Leonhardt:
 Over the last 60 years, poll questions that asked people which candidate they expected to win have been a better guide to the outcome of the presidential race than questions asking people whom they planned to vote for, the study found.</description>

      <description>I was up early this morning sifting through the market stories.
** Asia: crash ** Middle East: crash ** Europe: crash ** USA: set to open
There&amp;rsquo;s good news in all this loss. First, stocks were overpriced. At some point, they will bottom out and it will be time to start buying. Second, the Golden Age of the Central Banker seems to be over. And that is very good news.</description>

      <title>Results of the Cabinet Matching Game</title>

      <description>A couple weeks ago, I published a simple game for political nerds. Assuming the next president must build a cabinet from current candidates for the Republican nomination for president, how would you assign candidates to cabinet positions.
This was meant to be a fun exercise for people who spend too much time thinking about politics. Like the leaders-eat-last poll, this required hide, often dissatisfying choices. As a result, only six people completed the exercise which took up to a half hour.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s sad that Donald Trump has inspired so many good conservatives to promote fantasiesÂ about the 14th Amendment.
The Supreme Court addressed the issue of birthright citizenship directly, and Mark Levin and Laura Ingram know it. They are Constitutional lawyers.
Both Levin and Ingraham are familiar with United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) which established, thoroughly, that citizenship by birth has been the law of the land since before the Declaration of Independence and was codified by the 14th Amendment.</description>

      <description>This is the story of hard choices and how people resist making them.
Last week&amp;rsquo;s poll asked you to watch a video by Simon Sinek before answering two, simple, two-part questions: which Republican candidate for President and Missouri Governor is most likely and least likely to eat last?
I intended the poll to be hard. Not complicated, not long, but emotionally challenging.
Why the Poll Was Emotionally Challenging For several weeks, I have built a case for the importance of leadership.</description>

      <description>If you lack a unique, differentiating value, your only play is price.
In business, you command the price play by being very, very big and very, very efficient. In presidential politics, you&amp;rsquo;re unique or you close up shop and go home. Commodities don&amp;rsquo;t win executive offices. Usually.
Even though it&amp;rsquo;s early, only four Republican candidates for president have differentiating value propositions:

      <description>The next US President must be a great communicator.
Distilling complex and controversial problems into mental models accessible to large numbers of people is not deception&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s brilliance. The reason we hang onto sound bites isn&amp;rsquo;t because we&amp;rsquo;re stupid&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s because we&amp;rsquo;re busy. We all don&amp;rsquo;t have time to earn masters-degree understanding of every issue facing society and government. Honest, accurate distillations of the complex ideas allow us to choose and act quickly.</description>

      <description>Marine Corps officers eat last.
That simple insight inspired the title of Simon Sinek&amp;rsquo;s latest book, &amp;ldquo;Leaders Eat Last.&amp;rdquo; If I could influence high school or college curricula, no one would graduate without successfully completing a semester course on that principle.
Below is another remarkable video of Simon Sinek discussing how circumstances can override our desire to lead and serve and how leadership and service can fix almost any problem. But first, I&amp;rsquo;d like you think a bit more about these two critical needs: leadership and service.</description>

I love the way Simon Sinek thinks. Itâs no surprise, then, that his TED Talk on leadership could be the greatest definition of leadership Iâve ever heard.
Please watch and share. I have some thoughts and a poll following. [ted id=1998]
Contrasts give greater clarity. Sinekâs contrast between military leadership and business leadership says a lot about the state of American business.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s 117 pages of Ronald Reagan&amp;rsquo;s humor.Think of that. A US president who could fill a book with jokes.
My cursory review shows that about 60 percent of the jokes are on Reagan himself. And another 20 percent are on Republicans.
Ronald Reagan knew that life is too short and too precious to waste it on anger and pride. Better to spend your days getting laughs.</description>

 While 26 percent of Americans report that they canât live without their smartphone, only 20 percent of Americans say they canât live without sex, according to this infographic compiled by FinancesOnline.com, a personal finance website.

America&amp;rsquo;s Slums Are Exploding
The story is in the Atlantic, a progressive publication. But they admit what so many Americans know: the welfare state has failed those who needed it most. And it&amp;rsquo;s failing those never needed it but were sucked into it nonetheless.
 Half a century after President Lyndon B. Johnson declared a war on poverty, the number of Americans living in slums is rising at an extraordinary pace.</description>

[olympus_highlight color=&amp;quot;yellow&amp;rdquo;]Every person who wants to work should find a choice of occupations to pursue. And everyÂ occupation improves the life of the person doing the work, the people the work is done for, and the family and community in which the worker lives.[/olympus_highlight]

The opposite of work is not idleness but dependency, and dependency degrades human lives.</description>

A shooter confronted plain-clothes officers and opened fire. Officers returned fire, striking the suspect. The suspect is in critical, unstable condition in a local hospital. One officer was treated, but the severity and cause of his injury is unknown.
The shooting and at least one break-in of a business marred what had been peaceful commemorations of the death of Michael Brown.</description>

Great question. History being what it is, we can&amp;rsquo;t spread them across time, only across government. So this week&amp;rsquo;s poll is a little fun.
The rules:
You must fill the next White House cabinet using only the current candidates for President. You do not know who the President or Vice President is, so assume it&amp;rsquo;s none of the current candidates.</description>

OverÂ 24 million people watchedÂ the first Republican debate Thursday. That&amp;rsquo;s the largest audience ever for a cable program, save for sports.
Everybody knows why so many watched: peopleÂ wanted to see a fight break out between Chris Christie and Rand Paul.
Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s presence probably didn&amp;rsquo;t hurt. Let me clarify that. Trump&amp;rsquo;s appearance helped rating. His performance might have ended his campaign.

      <description>Conservatism blesses the world.
Our principles dignify people with work that** produces value**. We leave them **free to pursue happiness**, which includes their work, their leisure, their learning, and their families.
Our cause is moral and spiritual, not economic. We want everyone to experience and benefit from meaningful work because work provides people with self-esteem and satisfaction. Work is not punishment; it&amp;rsquo;s a blessing.
We do oppose things, but only those things that threaten to degrade human beings by denying them the dignity and benefits of working and living their own lives.</description>

      <description>Readers of this blog believe a stronger service ethic would make America a stronger country, but no one wants the federal government involved. And 95 percent of respondents agree that performing service benefits the volunteer as much or more as it benefits the recipients of the work.  
Those are the key finding from last weekâs poll on service. Specifically, 82 percent agree with the statement âA strong service ethic would make America stronger.</description>

      <description>Are you tired of being angry?
Did you know that a lot of other people are tired of your anger?
Did you know that 70 percent of Americans donât like politics?
Did you know that the 70 percent of Americans who donât like politics wonât vote for anything an angry person tells them to vote for?
Go look it up. Itâs totally true.
So many conservatives want another Reagan, but they want an angry, vengeful, belligerent Reagan.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time I didn&amp;rsquo;t like Joe LeGrand.
It was 3rd grade. I was in the Epiphany Toppers Drum and Bugle Corps, and Joe was a bugler who stood right in front of me. He kept turning around and giving me dirty looks. So I decided right then and there that I didn&amp;rsquo;t like him.
Joe was a year ahead of me in school. While our lives intersected a lot, we weren&amp;rsquo;t really close.</description>

      <description>Thereâs a huge, important fiinding in a new pollâone I believe will affect a lot of elections nationally and in Missouri in 2016. In fact, 2016 will come down to one word.
Write down what you think that word is before reading on.
STLTPC vs. USA on President First, letâs look at some polls.
St. Louis Tea Party members see the GOP Presidential race a little differently than the country at large.</description>

I met them early in my junior year. We had just one thing in common: we were all transferees. We were not native DuBourgers. We transferred.</description>

      <description>Did you ever see a movement grow?
Did you see the way it starts?
Did you feel it spread around you?
Did you hear it rustling the leaves and scraping the sidewalk?
Did you want to kill it?
The weird thing about movements is that opposition tends to strengthen them. Movements feed on hostility the way rats feed on garbage.
The way you kill a movement is infiltration and fragmentation.</description>

      <description>The Holy See is in Rome.
The Empty See is in St. Louis.
The Metropolitan Taxicab Commission (MTC) is a racket to protect incumbent taxicab companies. They use their power to keep St. Louis in the stone age of transportation.
Itâs time to dissolve the MTC. It has served its purpose and outlived its usefulness. Like the riverboat commission of the 1850s.
Until then, I will do everything in my power to avoid taxis in St.</description>

      <description>The Transportation Empowerment Act gives states control and funding for their roads. It is a far superior to the Highway Trust Fund, which is slush fund for pork projects.
Transportation Empowerment Act (TEA) from Senator Mike Lee would gradually shift federal gasoline taxes from Washington back to the states where they were collected without a Washington DC handling fee and without strings attached.
TEA embodies an idea I first heard from Ronald Reaganwhen he was governor of California.</description>

      <description>Last week&amp;rsquo;s poll asked for your degree of support for Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s candidacy. This poll received far less attention than the Missouri GOP Governor poll of the previous week, as only 60 people responded.
On the plus side, there was no detectable cheating on the Trump poll.

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve reached the end.
On Monday, we corrected disinformation about The Franklin Project.
Next, we looked at the historical conservative framework for national service.
Wednesday was a dissection of The Franklin Project&amp;rsquo;s Plan of Action (as distinguished from the group&amp;rsquo;s vision.)
Yesterday, we examined the consequences of ignoring the call for national service.
Today, we offer an oversimplified proposal for Missouri&amp;rsquo;s version of a national-service program. While inadequate, it is a start.</description>

      <description>In part 1 of this series, we clarified some misconceptions and falsehoods about the Franklin Project.
In part 2, we examined the debate on the right from 1990 with William F. Buckley and Milton Friedman.
Part 3 was a critique of the Franklin Project&amp;rsquo;s Plan of Action.
Today, we will look at the consequences should conservatives turn their backs on the concept of developing a service ethos in America.

      <description>This is part three of a five-part series on national service. Part 1 introduced the controversy and corrected a major misconception. Part 2 looked at national service through the eyes of conservative giants, Milton Friedman, William F. Buckley, and Ronald Reagan.
So, whatâs wrong with the Franklin Project? Plenty.
The Franklin Project promotes the idea of a renewed ethos of national service in America. Itâs mission:
 The Franklin Project envisions a future in which a year of full-time national serviceâa service yearâis a cultural expectation, a common opportunity, and a civic rite of passage for every young American.</description>

      <description>This is part 2 of a series on national service and the Franklin Project. Read part 1 here.
First, answer this for yourself: would you vote for William F. Buckley Jr?
Milton Friedman on National Service My friend Lloyd Sloan points out that Milton Friedman disagreed with Buckleyâs call for national service. It seems appropriate, then, to view the idea of a service ethos through the eyes of two champions of conservatism of the 20th century.</description>

It begins making stuff up.
That âmaking stuff upâ has become the chief form of amusement among those who oppose Eric Greitens for Governor.
The current fiction they advance has to do with an organization called The Franklin Project. The fiction advanced by a few Facebook warriors goes something like this: âThe Franklin Project wants mandatory national service.</description>

This was not a controlled survey, so be careful what you read into it. Instead of using the poll as a measure of breadth, I recommend looking at from a few other angles.
Suspicious Voting Yes, there was a lot of suspicious voting. At least one candidate received his or her strongest support from a single data center in India.</description>

      <description>Republican consultant David Barklage is in a weird place.
Barklage grew up in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, along with Peter Kinder. Barklage has been Kinderâs campaign consultant for yearsâall of Kinderâs races, as far as I know. They were a team. David Barlage was Peter Kinderâs chief of staff when Kinder was president pro tem of the Missouri Senate in 2002.

      <description>Greece&amp;rsquo;s parliament just signed its surrender to Germany. The country signed over virtually all of its national assets and all its future income for 30 years. No one believes Greece will make good on the agreement, and Greece didn&amp;rsquo;t want the deal. Germany demanded it, and Greece surrendered. But Greece will default at some point. Then what? Will Germany send its army? Probably.
In Washington, Barack Obama berated a skeptical press for questioning the agreement he reached with the world&amp;rsquo;s largest exporter of Islamic terrorism.</description>

 Good old Clausewitz. Best book on war ever written. (The Art of War was about something else.)
But the 21st century has reversed his famous line. Politics has become war by other means.
Germany has a history of waging wars of conquest. World War I. World War II. The Greek bailout. As Stratfor&amp;rsquo;s George Friedman explains:</description>

I was.
Sure, Iâd heard the rumors. The whispers spread by some Republican campaign operatives. But Iâve learned to trust those campaign operatives about as far as I fund the national debt.
Then, Senator John Lamping sent me a link to this Fox News story:

      <description>Down in my former state of South Carolina, the legislature hastily voted to remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol building. That is their prerogative, and I take no offense at their move.
What I do worry about is the haste.
South Carolinaâs action on the flag reflected a spasm instigated by the horrible deeds of a horrible manâan unthinkable crime and grave sin. I can understand how the murdererâs association with the flag would lead people to connect the flag to the murders.</description>

      <description>So how to reenergize the innovation diffusion machine? This is key: âA level playing field that does not favour incumbents over entrants. Many policy measures, from environmental to fiscal measures, are designed to favour incumbents.â More entry through startups and more exit by uncompetitive incumbents.
 &amp;ndash;JAMES PETHOKOUKIS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE
The Metropolitan Taxicab Commission is a crony club for taxi company executives and their hospitality friends, and its primary purpose is to kill transportation innovation and thwart price competition.</description>

      <description>The world is even more fragile than it was in 2007. The big banks are bigger. Aggregate bank assets are concentrated in fewer hands. The bank derivatives books are much larger. Market liquidity is worse.
 âJames Rickards, The Daily Reckoning
Well, ainât that just dandy?
And itâs undeniably true. We were told that the 2008 financial meltdown was caused by entities that had grown too large: banks, insurance companies, corporations, derivitives.</description>

      <description>Debt is not a guarantee of future payments in full. Rather, it is a risk that creditors take, in hopes of maybe being paid tomorrow.
 The key word there is &amp;ldquo;risk.&amp;rdquo;
If you&amp;rsquo;re willing to take the risk, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a premium â in the form of interest.
But the downside of that risk is that you lose your money. And Greece just called Germany&amp;rsquo;s bluff.

      <description>Greece has voted to reject the âtroika&amp;rsquo;sâ bailout terms. The people of Greece said ânoâ to the central banksters who encourage sovereigns to enslave themselves under mountains of debt.
The Greeks showed remarkable courage and resiliency, and their example could disrupt the entire international banking system. Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge:
 The Greek people have spoken and they said &amp;ldquo;OXI&amp;rdquo;! So congratulations Greece: for the first time you had the chance to tell the Troika, the unelected eurocrats, and the entire status quo establishment, not to mention all the banks, how you really felt and based on the most recent results, some 61% of you told it to go fuck itself.</description>

      <description>About this time, a variety of railroads began trying to build their own networks to the West, but the St. Louis city government refused to grant the permits required for constructing railroad bridges across the river at their location, even though St. Louis was the logical choice and would have been a perfect place for a rail hub. Apparently, the politicians in St. Louis felt their duty was to protect the riverboat industry, at that time their life and blood, from any and all competition.</description>

      <description>William Hennessy: Psychopomps are carriers of the dead, but they carry them to their afterlife.
Dottie Bailey: Cool!!
William Hennessy: We are in that phase of history. The 20th century is dying, or dead
Dottie Bailey: Makes me sad though.
William Hennessy: Everything that we called ânormalâ for all our lives lies listless in the beaks of sparrowsâpsychopompsâon their way to a new birth.
That rebirth wonât happen for another 5 to 10 years.</description>

      <description>This post is about the control you have.
And the control you donât have.
Last week was tough on a lot of us. The Supreme Court limited your freedom. The same-sex marriage case was very similar to Roe v. Wade in judicial legislation. States lost the power to regulate marriage. (Thereâs a deep theological discussion around whether the state ever had any say in marriage, but thatâs for another post.)</description>

      <description>Limited government, fiscal responsibility, and the other tea party principles are not ends. They were never ends. Tea party principles are merely the most effective and efficient means to nobler ends
Those ends include a society and a nation that respects and protects life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Without life, of what use are the others?
Just as we speak out when &amp;ldquo;government becomes destructive of these ends,&amp;rdquo; so we must speak out when misguided and deranged individuals pervert those principlesâor any principlesâto their own illegitimate and murderous ends.</description>

No. Bill Clinton wanted you to ramble. He wanted to make you the most important person in the room for two minutes. He listened forÂ a nugget of information&amp;ndash;a story&amp;ndash;he could use in his next speech.
If you&amp;rsquo;re running for office remember: the most important person in every room is the voter you&amp;rsquo;re talking with.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s what happens when you raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, according to scientists:
Nothing.
Well, not nothing. All kinds of bad things happen to the economy. But nothing happens for two groups of people central to the whole debate: workers who get a bump to $15 and employers who have to bump to $15 an hour.
Most cities and states that have raised their minimum wage laws to $15 will phase in the increase over five years.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll make this brief.
If we must respect (revere?) the erstwhile Bruce Jenner for self-identifying as a woman, we have to respect Rachel Dolezal for self-identifying as black.
Both voluntarily left the world of privilege, as it were, to join an underclass&amp;ndash;an identifiable minority. Jenner left manhood; Dolezal left whitehood.
The left doesn&amp;rsquo;t see it that way, though. Apparently, rejecting one&amp;rsquo;s biological sex is okay, but rejecting one&amp;rsquo;s biological race isn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Without comment . . .
 Jefferson City, MO, May 29, 2015 - A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality ofÂ Senate Bill 672, passed by the Missouri General Assembly in 2014, was filed in Cole County circuit court on May 29th.
 The lawsuit claims that the General Assembly ignored the constitutional limits to their legislative authority. The Missouri Constitution includes clauses that prohibit legislators from changing the purpose of a bill, including multiple subjects in one bill, or passing a âspecial lawâ that fails to treat everyone equally.</description>

      <description>Washington (APP) âIn a Rose Garden press conference today, President Barack Obama introduced Art Vandelay as his choice to head the troubled Export Import Bank for a five-year term, pending approval by the Senate.
The shake-up comes as Congress debates whether or not to extend the bankâs authorization amid heavy opposition from conservative and libertarian groups led by Heritage Action for America.
Mr. Vandelay brings almost 30 years of experience in the export-import business, where he tradedÂ in commodities as varied as potato chips, diapers, and matches.</description>

They say the Export Import Bank is a tiny agency that creates jobs for small business while producing a profit for the Treasury. And rescues baby rabbits from dangerous predators. And itâs gluten free.
Call us skeptics.

      <description>I usually breeze through books.
I read Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman in four days. And it has math.
I read Eric Greitens&amp;rsquo;s book The Heart and the Fist in two days.
Why did it take me over a month to finish Resilience?
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure, but here&amp;rsquo;s what I think.
First, the book compels action. How could I read this paragraph without writing a blog post?
  If we are trapped in a life where everything is provided for us, our minds fail to grow, our relationships atrophy, and our spirits deteriorate.</description>

Raise your hand if you know someone who woke one morning and ran a marathon having never so much as walked around the block.
No hands?
Of course not. A few freaks of nature might be able to go from zero to 26.2 in no time, but most people would hurt themselves trying. And never do it again.

But if that step is in the wrong direction, you might end up 2,000 miles from your goal.
Many believe America took a step in the wrong direction long ago&amp;ndash;about the time &amp;ldquo;progressivism&amp;rdquo; became popular among political, business, and academic elites in the early 20th century.
If progressivism was a step in the wrong direction, it&amp;rsquo;s led us at least 2,000 miles from our target.</description>

      <description>Harsh, I know.
The St. Louis Blues disappeared from the NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs in a 4-2, first-round collapse for the third consecutive season.
And this year was supposed to be different. So different. With off-season pickups like Jori Lehtera and Paul Stastny, we expected St. Louis to shut down for a parade in June, not in the 3rd period of game six.
Instead, we&amp;rsquo;re wondering how soon will T.J. Oshie sweaters go on the clearance rack at Dick&amp;rsquo;s?</description>

Dellena&amp;rsquo;s business has fallen 60 percent since the first riots. She&amp;rsquo;s repaired the damage to her salon, but business is slow.
Despite all her challenges, Dellena still found the time and energy to host Center for Self-Governance training in her shop on a Saturday, foregoing that day&amp;rsquo;s revenue to learn about freedom and responsibility.</description>

I did recently. This gem of a paragraph leapt off the page and into my mind:
 I believe this nation hungers for a spiritual revival; hungers to once again see honor placed above political expediency; to see government once again the protector of our liberties, not the distributor of gifts and privilege. Government should uphold and not undermine those institutions which are custodians of the very values upon which civilization is founded &amp;ndash; Faith, education and, above all, family.</description>

People say it like it&amp;rsquo;s a bad thing.
What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with the government not knowing that one bit of information about your private medical life? Can&amp;rsquo;t government keep out of at least this one, extremely personal matter?
The do-gooders and busy-bodies want Missouri to maintain a database (tied into similar databases in all other states) that keeps a permanent record of every prescription a doctor or dentist writes.</description>

      <description>In its entire history, who was the safest CEO for Apple?
In other words, if you were a corporate recruiter hired by Apple&amp;rsquo;s board to find a chief executive, whom would hire?
I&amp;rsquo;ll answer this later, but first here&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m asking.
Who Would You Recruit? In response to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post on Brunner vs. Greitens, someoneÂ asked meÂ a similarÂ question about Eric Greitens. The inquisitorÂ seems to question my judgment for preferring Greitens over John Brunner.</description>

      <description>You know the feeling.
You support someone for office. Call this person Candidate A. You&amp;rsquo;re all in. You&amp;rsquo;ve told your friends about this great person.
Then another candidate jumps in to oppose your candidate. Let&amp;rsquo;s call this person Candidate B. This insurgent has great qualifications. You campaigned for Candidate BÂ in another race a few years ago. You&amp;rsquo;ve talked him up. In the past,Â told your friends to vote for Candidate B.</description>

      <description>I own a ton of domain names.
Most of them I&amp;rsquo;ll never use. I bought them&amp;ndash;and pay for them&amp;ndash;because I don&amp;rsquo;t want anyone else to have them. Many contain &amp;ldquo;teabaggers.&amp;rdquo; Many contain &amp;ldquo;teaparty.&amp;rdquo; Many contain &amp;ldquo;Hennessy,&amp;rdquo; although the cognac people had sucked up quite a few of those already.
Everyone should invest in domains containing their surname. Anyone who is even mildly famous should own the domains containing their full name.</description>

      <description>Brett wanted to know more about Eric Greitens.
Ben deferred to me to tell the Greitens story. I went through the usual, remarkable life of a man, eleven years my junior, a century my senior. I told him about Duke, boxing, Bosnia, Rwanda, Mother Teresa. I told him about boxing at Oxford and becoming a SEAL.
Nothing from Brett.
&amp;ldquo;Really,&amp;rdquo; I thought. &amp;ldquo;How stuck-up is this guy?&amp;rdquo;

Great leaders inspire thought and action.
But their real value? Great leaders inspire action. Hard action. Uncomfortable action.
I&amp;rsquo;m reading Resilience by Eric Greitens. I have already bought six copies of the book, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll buy more. I want everyone to read it. The book changes people.</description>

I sat in a booth at the Holiday Inn in Quincy, Illinois, with my wife and two friends from St. Louis. The day before was my wife&amp;rsquo;s birthday, which she graciously spent waiting for me to speak at a tea party in Quincy.
Angela and I sat with Jim Durbin and Ben Evans. About four feet away, sitting at the bar, were Andrew Breitbart and editor-in-chief of Andrew&amp;rsquo;s BigGovernment.</description>

      <description>I was on my high school&amp;rsquo;s board of education for a year. It was quite an honor, honestly, but I screwed it up.
At the time, I was a software architect. They put me on the board as the technology guy. I was supposed to make the case for more funding for smart boards and other tech stuff.
But I said kids really don&amp;rsquo;t need more technology in school. Technology, I said, was like sex education: they&amp;rsquo;ll get more than they can handle on the streets or watching TV.</description>

Poor Catherine Hanaway.
Her shadowy operatives worked so hard to defeatÂ Tom Schweich, but a new threat to Hanaway&amp;rsquo;s coronation emerged: Eric Greitens. (You can read all about Eric Greitens, here.)
The GOP establishment&amp;rsquo;s inept, new whisper campaign against Greitens is so amateurish and sad it evokes the kind of sympathy one feels toward the ignorance of animals (to paraphrase William F. Buckley).</description>

Leftist donors flooded Texas with money for two years.
Wendy Davis was the poster-child in 2014, but she was only a candidate of convenience. Leftists know that turning Texas purple would mean leftist dominationÂ in America. In 2013 &amp;ldquo;purple Texas&amp;rdquo;Â was all the talk. From Huffington Post:
 Last week,Â PoliticoÂ reportedÂ that national Democrats are creating a &amp;ldquo;large-scale independent group&amp;rdquo; aimed at turning Texas into a legitimate electoral battleground.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s accept that people are lazy.
I noticed no one rose to argue, so universal laziness is a given.
When political consultants and parties recruit candidates, they do the lazy thing. They look for candidates who are easily electable. They want people who look good, speak well, shake hands like they&amp;rsquo;re still alive, and never made the papers for slapping their spouse.
Actually, they want people who are squeaky clean. Boring.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What did you give up for Lent?&amp;rdquo;
Ever get that one? Like it&amp;rsquo;s something you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to post on your Facebook page.
A very good priest I knew, Dom Oppenheimer, warned against revealing one&amp;rsquo;s Lenten sacrifice.
&amp;ldquo;When you tell others what you gave up for Lent, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to feel some pride,&amp;rdquo; he explained. &amp;ldquo;But pride is the worst sin.&amp;rdquo;
That actually makes a lot of sense when you think about.</description>

And the remaining 1% already agree with you.
No, the way to scare people about Net Neutrality is this chart from Statista:

So let&amp;rsquo;s have a little blunt talk about race from a West County white guy&amp;rsquo;s point of view (which is alway helpful).
Faction A and Faction B Whenever race comes up, two large factions shut down. They shut down intellectually because &amp;lsquo;race&amp;rsquo; touches an irrational, emotional nerve.
Faction AÂ views every issue as a race problem. They see rain at a picnic as racist.</description>

Such a power does not destroy, but it prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, butÂ it compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.</description>

      <description>The human brain is three times as sensitive to pain as it is to gain.
Thatâs a gross over-simplification, but itâs basically true. In other words, youâll work three-times harder to save a dollar you have than to earn one you donât.
Put another way, you wonât bet a dollar with even odds unless you stand to gain three dollars for a win.
Thatâs not a flaw. It keeps you alive.</description>

      <description>Fate moves in mysterious ways.
Just days before State Auditor and Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Schweich died, Eric Greitens announced an exploratory committee. Greitens wants to test the water of a possible run for Missouri Governor as a Republican.
Greitens would be, perhaps, the most remarkable human being ever to pursue the office of Governor of Missouri. Hereâs a sampling of Greitensâs achievements:
 Humanitarian whoâs worked in Rwanda, Bosnia, Central America, India and other disaster zonesâusually man-made disaster zones Boxer who won championships in England Rhodes Scholar who completed the program at Oxford Navy SEAL who earned the Bronze Star among other accolades in four tours in Iraq Founder of The Mission Continues to give wounded veterans a mission and a purpose in life Time Magazineâs 100 most influential people in the world Forbesâ Magazineâs 50 greatest leaders in the world  Purpose Over Party Greitens is no ideologue.</description>

Allman called Danforth a failure and a thug. According to Allman, Danforth&amp;rsquo;s sin was defending a friend against lies, defending a people against centuries-old hate.
I guess Jamie Allman and his handlers like lies and hate.
I&amp;rsquo;d hate to be Jamie Allman on judgement day.

*1. Name 3 people you consider wildly successful. *2. For each person you named, what is the number one criterion for establishing his or her success?
Please do that before continuing.
Done?
Okay. Iâm going to guess that, when all the answers are tabulated, wealth and income will be the top criteria for success.</description>

      <description>Excerpts fromÂ past posts on Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View about Tom Schweich
&amp;ldquo;Integrity&amp;rdquo; is the first word I think of when trying to describe Tom Schweich.
Rock n Roll Lunch We met for lunch on a hot day in April 2010. I expected a typical GOP establishment hack: smooth, overly friendly, defensive, and forgettable. I expected the man others told meÂ to expect. But I met someone very different.
How different? That lunch ended listening to his band&amp;rsquo;s recording of their original rock song.</description>

May perpetual light shine on him, and may his soul and all the souls of all the faithful departed rest in peace.</description>

      <description>Paul Hamby asked a question last month.
I was only one of the many he asked, and, being the rude bastard I am sometimes, I took a month to reply. And being lazy, I figured I should get a blog post out of it.
So here&amp;rsquo;s my answer to the question &amp;ldquo;who inspired you to get involved in politics?&amp;rdquo;

      <description>I am so embarrassed.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know that Fred Sauer, Gretchen Logue, and Anne Gassel were suing Missouri over Common Core.
Did you know that?
(I probably knew it and forgot. Sorry.)
But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: THEY WON!!!!
Wait. YOU won. You won because Fred, Gretchen, and Anne stuck their necks out for you. And for me.
So Thank You! to Fred, Gretchen, and Anne. And this case seems really, really big.</description>

      <description>The last two years of Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s presidency will see the rise of a new Russian empire.
This new empire will resemble the Soviet Union in shape, the Czars in style.
We looked at this subject over the summer (here and here). To summarize those blogs:
 The US-led coup of Ukraine convinced Putin to reassert safer borders Russia wants to build a buffer between itself and NATO Putin wants to re-establish a Russian Empire to revitalize Russian pride and influence Western debt and war-weariness make NATO impotent Putin knows the next US president might be more of a manÂ than Obama, even if its Hillary Putin will want to complete his expansion by January 20, 2017 Ukraine is as good as done and Poland will fall under Russian influence  I still believe all of that.</description>

I hemmed and hawed and told her a story she probably didn&amp;rsquo;t want to hear. The best I could come up with was:
 I don&amp;rsquo;t trust the FCC or the Obama Administration to do anything honest I don&amp;rsquo;t trust the Republican establishment to do anythingÂ right  First, the Obama Administration would love to get control of internet content. They can already read every message, every keystroke anyone types anywhere.</description>

      <description>Why have conservatives and right-leaning libertarians made so little progress since 2009?
Consider that the GOP was written off for dead following the 2008 election. Republicans disappeared from the press. When a Republican popped up on a Sunday talk show, he was talking about compromise and getting along.
Then the Tea Party happened, and all of a sudden the GOP&amp;rsquo;s testes descended. But after two off-year wave elections that gave the GOP their largest majorities since Hoover, the GOP seems poised to double down on the crony capitalist, elitist policies and candidates that got them tossed out of Washington in 2006 and 2008.</description>

And some friends turned hostile. They had good reasons. And I was probably a little cavalier. And I talked way too long.
But last September I wanted to start something that would help real people in our neighborhood while advancing liberty and upsetting abusive government. Sure, I&amp;rsquo;d rather upset the federal government in Washington, but my arms are little short to box with Harry Reid.</description>

      <description>Do people become cops just so they can write speeding tickets?
According to the National Sheriffsâ Association, writing speeding tickets is a police officerâs noblest calling. People and technologies that help drivers drive more safely and obey the law interfere with that noble mission of revenue generation, and the NSA isÂ out to stop it.
According to the Associated Press,the National Sheriffsâ Association wants to crack down onÂ the popular traffic navigation app Wazeâ¢ so that people will drive faster and cops can write more tickets.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s some perspective:
 St. Louis County accounts for 22 percent of Missouri&amp;rsquo;s population and over 50 percent of traffic tickets St. Ann&amp;rsquo;s traffic court revenue exploded from about $500,000 in 2009 to over $3.5 million last year Traffic court generates 90 percent of the total revenue for one Missouri city Ferguson, Missouri, has three outstanding traffic ticket warrants for every citizen The mayor of Edmundson in North St.</description>

Our annual St. Louis Tea Party / Heritage Action Christmas Party started at 6:00 in the evening on December 17. I knew Auditor Tom Schweich planned to attend, and I looked forward to seeing him.
About 3:00 the problems started. People scurrying to wrap up projects before the Christmas break led to errors, questions, and never-ending email threads.
I finally made it out of the office about 7:30 and arrived at Scarecrow in Chesterfield a little after 8:00.</description>

      <description>You might have noticed that my report on the Speaker election process lacked enthusiasm.
Now you know why.
Boehner is moving quickly to purge conservatives from all committees of meaning. He has vowed to cooperate with the White House and Democrats. He has vowed never to shut down government again, no matter how evil, onerous, or destructive of liberty government becomes.
Boehner has gone full native.
That&amp;rsquo;s a predictable outcome of a failed coup.</description>

For the record, I&amp;rsquo;d love to see the election go to a second, third, fourth, or ninety-fifth ballot. But I don&amp;rsquo;t expect Boehner to lose. And if Boehner should lose, Gohmert might not win. The winner will need a LOT of Republican votes, and Boehner supporters won&amp;rsquo;t vote for the guy who inserted himself into the race.</description>

What do police officer think about traffic ticket quotas? Here&amp;rsquo;s one officer&amp;rsquo;s thoughts:
 In my agency, those of us in patrol had to keep a &amp;ldquo;Daily.&amp;rdquo; This would be a formal document that showed the times, addresses where we went, written in code, of what we had done.
 On the back were boxes for how many traffic citations, criminal citations, parking citations and felony and misdemeanor arrests we had made on that day.</description>

And, yes, &amp;ldquo;House RepublicanÂ Leadership&amp;rdquo; is a code word for Ann Wagner.
Every victorious Republican ran on a promise to aggressively check Obama&amp;rsquo;s illegal executive actions.
They weren&amp;rsquo;t all lying. Only the &amp;ldquo;leaders&amp;rdquo; lied.
House leadership is trying to weasel out of its commitment to voters to block Obama&amp;rsquo;s illegal activities.
The House can easily** attach a rider to the upcoming spending bill** prohibiting any money from going toward Obama&amp;rsquo;s 10 illegal illegal alien memoranda.</description>

      <description>The danger of jumping to conclusions isnât that you might be wrong. Itâs that your brain will be unable to recognize its error.
Weâve all heard of the psychological (or just logical) fallacy of confirmation bias. Itâs worth looking at three aspects of confirmation bias from Science Daily:
*1. In psychology and cognitive science, confirmation bias (or confirmatory bias) is a tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one&amp;rsquo;s preconceptions, leading to statistical errors.</description>

      <description>The US House of Representatives is not a meritocracy. And that&amp;rsquo;s a shame.
House &amp;ldquo;leadership&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually have anything to do with leadership. It has everything to do with money.
In a story about the fall from power of Nancy Pelosi, Michael Barone describes how the House leadership process evolved from seniority to raw cash.
  For years, liberal Democrats had decried the seniority system, which automatically made conservative Southerners (and/or senile members) committee chairmen.</description>

I tried to ignore Ferguson today, but I glanced at Twitter hashtag #Ferguson a moment ago. The first tweet I read inspired this post. Someone wrote that &amp;ldquo;being able to be thankful after #Fergson is a privilege itself.&amp;rdquo;
I understand how someone could feel that their &amp;ldquo;gratitude privilege&amp;rdquo; had been revoked. We lost our daughter just before Christmas in 1994, about four weeks after I got out of the Navy.</description>

Time is short. The people affected by last nightâs riots need help rebuilding and jobs right now. While I donât have complete plans, I can throw out eight ideas.</description>

The clearest example of Hancock&amp;rsquo;s failure was John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s campaign for US Senate in 2012.
Brunner is an exceptional businessman with a remarkably clear and accurate political philosophy. Had Brunner succeeded in winning the GOP nomination for Senate, Claire McCaskill would be retired, the GOP would have a Senate majority already, and Rand Paul would have a philosophical friend in the upper chamber.</description>

      <description>_Updated: the original title said &amp;ldquo;Congress is for sale.&amp;rdquo; My mistake. I meant Government. _
Once upon a time in America, people built companies by filling society&amp;rsquo;s unmet needs. To survive, a company relied on innovation, quality, and, of course, good advertising. The best advertisement being word of mouth.
That&amp;rsquo;s all changed now.
The way to grow a successful company is to get government to protect your market, dampen competition, and require people to buy what you sell.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest with ourselves: President Obama&amp;rsquo;s unilateral, dictatorial action on immigration is not to benefit illegals. It&amp;rsquo;s to punish American voters for rejecting him.
This is personal.
In two years, the next American president will let this and many other Obama executive orders expire. Executive orders are not law. They expire with the term of the president who signed them. No future president is bound to renew them. And the next president won&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Governors
Republicans were supposed to lose governor seats. Instead, they picked up nine or ten. That&amp;rsquo;s huge, because governors become presidents. Executive leadership is different from coalition &amp;ldquo;leadership,&amp;rdquo; and governors are real executives. Look for the GOP&amp;rsquo;s gubernatorial wins to play big roles in 2016 and 2020.
This Morning (New York Times):
 Democrats seem to have their best shot in Florida, where the stateâs former Republican governor, Charlie Crist, is running as a Democrat against the Republican incumbent, Rick Scott.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s the Heritage Foundation&amp;rsquo;s donors and leaders. It&amp;rsquo;s Heritage Action and its Sentinels.
It&amp;rsquo;s decidedly NOT the ruling class, the two big parties.
I had the high privilege of sharing a panel with 14 people who work a lot harder than I do.</description>

      <description>The White House and its corrupt Department of Justice has one chance to change the election&amp;rsquo;s outcome.According to Nate Silver&amp;rsquo;s FiveThirtyEight blog, the GOP has a 62.1 percent chance of a Senate majority. With nine days left until the election, andÂ with President Obama&amp;rsquo;s approval and likability plunging, the Democrats face a huge loss.
Apathetic Democrats Many political observers blame Democrat voter apathy, particularly among African-Americans. The black vote that swelled in 2008 and 2012 with Obama on the ballot shows signs of deflating in 2014 as it did in 2010.</description>

      <description>From about 1978 until the Monica Lewinsky fiasco, the GOP was called &amp;ldquo;the party of ideas.&amp;rdquo;Â I miss the ideas.
William F. Buckley helped. Buckley liked big ideas and smart people. He liked politicians who gave legs to great ideas and governors with the gutsÂ to experiment. Governor Ronald Reagan appeared on Buckley&amp;rsquo;sÂ Firing Line shortly after the Gipper became California&amp;rsquo;s governor. Reagan talked about many ideas he was trying or hoping to try.</description>

I spend about 1-2 hours on most posts. That&amp;rsquo;s writing, researching, photo editing, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s time consuming. It&amp;rsquo;s also worth the effort.
Blogging is an opportunity cost, too. Every hour I spend blogging is an hour I&amp;rsquo;m not doing anything else. The things I&amp;rsquo;m not doing include:
** admiring my wife ** talking to my kids ** catching up with friends ** advancing my career ** cleaning up my office ** changing my underwear ** cheering on the Blues (or Cardinals or Rams) ** working out ** washing my car ** fixing that door that doesn&amp;rsquo;t open right ** training my dogs toÂ make a proper CC and club soda ** paying bills ** answering emails ** blowing the leaves out of the garage ** hunting copperheads and rattlesnakes (we have both out here) ** visiting my parents</description>

      <description>Maybe this logic sucks, but this is my logic.Â When I vote, I ignore my positions on issues.Â Instead, I use my vote to advance two objectives:
*1. I want my vote to improve policy towards liberty. *2. I want my vote to maximize my political power.
A simple test that I ask myself is this: If I vote for A, do I expect resulting policy to be more or less to my liking?</description>

      <description>My phone and inbox lit up all morning.
Missouri Republicans are FREAKING OUT that Speaker Apparent John Diehl could go down to defeat at the hands of conservative/libertarianÂ grassroots activists. The freak-out is over a press conference in Queeny Park at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, September 30.

I heard of the Stop Diehl project last week. On Saturday, mostly Republican volunteers began a door-to-door campaign in Diehl&amp;rsquo;s district to block re-election.</description>

      <description>When people asked me to get behind Rick Stream, I first wanted to make sure that was the right thing. I remembered that I have a friend whoÂ helped Rick a while ago. So I asked her.
Rick Stream is &amp;ldquo;a quiet leader.&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t see him as a politician,&amp;rdquo; she told me. We were talking about Rick Stream, the candidate for St. Louis County Executive.

      <description>Accountability? We don&amp;rsquo;t need no stinking accountability.
 No, Ann Wagner didn&amp;rsquo;t actually say that. But her comments to a 2nd District Republican committee meeting on Tuesday gave at least one attendee the impression that Mrs. Wagner opposes the idea of conservatives holding Congress accountable.
Ann Wagner Attacks the Conservative Heritage Action Rep. Ann Wagner accused the conservative Heritage Action for America of &amp;ldquo;pitting Republican against Republican&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;never attacking Dems&amp;rdquo; at the Republican meeting.</description>

      <description>Libertarians want to take over the world and leave you alone.
What a refreshing ambition!
A couple days ago, I wrote that I will not vote for Ann Wagner&amp;rsquo;s re-election in 2014. I arrived at that position after realizing that Mrs. Wagner and I share incompatible, mutually exclusive views on the proper relationship between government and people. She believes government should run markets. I believe government should make sure markets are fair.</description>

 To get to the lame duck.
You can&amp;rsquo;t trust the GOP establishment.
In case you missed it, the House GOP leadership pushed a Continuing Resolution to fund government through December. Now, these same GOP leaders will tell you they expect Republicans to take over the Senate in January. So why would they give Harry Reid a chance to use the lame duck Congress in December to pass an Obama-friendly long term CR?</description>

      <description>Rep. Ann Wagner&amp;rsquo;s Heritage Action Score is a disappointing 59.Â It&amp;rsquo;s about to drop even lower.
Last week, the Republican from Missouri&amp;rsquo;s 2nd Congressional District came out strongly in support of cronyism by endorsing and vowing to fight for extending the Export-Import Bank.
From Wagner&amp;rsquo;s interview with National Public Radio:
 âThere is some talk about a short-term reauthorization, perhaps six or seven months on Ex-Im,â she said. âIâd like it to be longer than that.</description>

I have something I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk to you about. It&amp;rsquo;s about the tea party movement. But it&amp;rsquo;s really about understanding two very important concepts:
*1. Living to our purpose. *2. Doing what&amp;rsquo;s important.

When there&amp;rsquo;s a great need for Tea Party services, I&amp;rsquo;m tied up with work obligations. Something has to give, and it&amp;rsquo;s usually the thing that doesn&amp;rsquo;t generate revenue.
But we all have work to do. Ferguson businesses and families are still struggling with the effects of the riots.</description>

      <description>Did you ever wonder why do-gooders and social planners never pay for their crimes?
Yesterday, I wrote about Jesse Jackson dressingÂ down at the hands of activists in a McDonald&amp;rsquo;s parking lot in Ferguson. I pointed out that Martin Luther King and Dick Gregory were similarly dismissed by rioters in the 1960s. Some things never change.
One thing that has changed is the economic gap between whites and blacks. That&amp;rsquo;s gotten worse despite trillions in federal poverty programs that went mostly to &amp;ldquo;community organizing.</description>

First, though, a little history.
One of the greatest books ever on race-based poverty and jobs programs is Tom Wolfe&amp;rsquo;s Mau-MauingÂ the Flak-Catchers. You won&amp;rsquo;t understand race politics in America without reading it. Twice. Four times, maybe.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve read it, you know why Jesse Jackson and Capt. Ron Johnson and all the other &amp;ldquo;black leaders&amp;rdquo; are impotent to stop riots.</description>

      <description>****UPDATE
Tim Jones let me know that I&amp;rsquo;m giving the legislature more power than it actually has.
Veto sessions are limited to overriding vetos. Thus the name. BUT the governor can call a Special Session to vote on a Ferguson Tax Holiday. That session can run concurrent with the Veto Session, saving taxpayer dollars.
SO &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; New Action: Ask Jay Nixon (via Twitter and Facebook) to call a Special Session concurrent with the Veto Session to create a Tax Holiday for Ferguson/Dellwood.</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s why a small band of (mostly) white people from (mostly) West County drove to Ferguson (and Dellwood) to shop tonight.
We targeted the small businesses that were hit hard by violence&amp;ndash;violence committed (mostly) by out of town agitators, criminals, vandals, and hooligans.
We drove to Ferguson to make two statements with our actons: 1) Ferguson is OUR community, and 2) Ferguson is open for business.</description>

      <description>Since the Post won&amp;rsquo;t run my reply a recent op-ed about the Ex-Im Bank, I&amp;rsquo;ll publish it here:
Huge multi-national corporations like to preach from the &amp;ldquo;small business&amp;rdquo; bible when it comes to the Export-Import bank. Unfortunately, most of the Ex-Im propaganda about how &amp;ldquo;small business&amp;rdquo; benefits crumbles under scrutiny.
Professor Stanford Levin of Southern Illinois University recently wrote an Op-Ed supporting reauthorization of the Export Import Bank. As the professor states, the Export-Import Bank provides cheap loans to foreign companies and governments with which to buy products sold by mostly large, multi-national companies with headquarters in the United States.</description>

Eat at Sweetie Pies on W. Florrisant, or head to Paulâs Market on Elizabeth, Drive down N./S. Florrisant for Shop-n-Save, Chinese Food, local eats, bakeries, dollar tree, etc. Ferguson also extends to New Halls Ferry and 270, where there is a Home Depot, another Shop-n-Save, Party store, UPS store, and more. https://livewellferguson.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/FergusonMap5-1.jpg

      <description>What did you think when you first heard reports of violence in Ferguson? I mean, after the shooting death of Michael Brown?
Did you ever for a moment think, &amp;ldquo;this is about more than just Michael Brown?&amp;rdquo;
I hate to say that. It&amp;rsquo;s embarrassing to admit that I&amp;rsquo;m so jaded as to think &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s all&amp;rdquo; when a young man dies. Sorry. I&amp;rsquo;m just being honest.
I understand community grief and anger.</description>

In the meantime, keep shopping Ferguson/Dellwood if you get the chance. And make an appointment on your calendar to shop Ferguson/Dellwood on Labor Day Weekend. Have out-of-town guests? Take them on a tour and have a meal in one of the great restaurants in the area.</description>

      <description>The next St. Louis County Executive better brace himself for this: poverty is exploding in the county.
I&amp;rsquo;m not saying poor people do bad things. I&amp;rsquo;m saying that, at some point, eliminating jobs and hope will drive people to take things. And they will take things by force. And they will show no mercy to anyone who tries to get in their way.
Right or wrong, it happens. And no militarized police force will stop it.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t written about Ferguson because I&amp;rsquo;ve known too little to add value. But ignorance hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped others from stirring up hate and discontent. For example, Missouri&amp;rsquo;s shakedown artist, Lacy Clay.
Lacy Clay, speaking from a private island in the Carribean, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Michael Brown was murdered. Clay knew or should have known the effect of his words: more violence. Either Clay meant to incite violence or he has a casual disregard for the effect of his irresponsible speech.</description>

      <description>I shout a lot.
Not with my lungs. With my pen. Well, not a pen, actually. With a wireless Bluetooth keyboard.
A few years ago, I shouted with my lungs at Tea Party events. I realized pretty quickly that shouting wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing any good. It worked at first. Shouting carried my voice to people who thought &amp;ldquo;no one believes what I believe.&amp;rdquo; Some people heard me yelling at the Arch and came out to see what the hell was going on.</description>

      <description>Is it possible that we do criminal trials backwards?
In the United States, criminal trials have two parts:
*1. Determination of guilt or innocence *2. Determination of penalty
Does that make sense?
What if we did it the other way around? What if, first, the prosecutor and defense attorney had to convince the judge or jury of the appropriate punishment for the crime in question. In this phase, the state would present the facts of the case.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not being judgmental or rhetorical with that title. I&amp;rsquo;m curious how other people deal with capital punishment.
Here&amp;rsquo; my story:
Once upon a time, I advocated for the death penalty. Loudly. Shrilly, at times.
In the 1980s and into 1990s, I read a lot. Philosophical. Religious. Legal. Historical. Lots of angles, but few perspectives. You see, I sought out confirming information. I searched high and low for perspectives that would justify my own.</description>

In my day job, I focus on two subjects: strategic behavioral science and analytics. Really smart people do most of the heavy analytics work. I deal with the human behavior (neuroeconomics, psychology, etc.). In our narrow field of loyalty and motivation, I think we&amp;rsquo;re the best in the business.

      <description>On Saturday, I raised a concern about Erick Erickson&amp;rsquo;s handling of Reince Priebus at Erickson&amp;rsquo;s annual RedState Gathering.
Today, Erick responded to widespread criticism of his decision to protect the GOP Chairman from questions about tactics in the Mississippi Republican Senate Runoff. Here&amp;rsquo;s the heart of Erickson&amp;rsquo;s answer:
 But there was more to it than me knowing people would be angry about Mississippi. First, many of the people told me what they wanted to ask Reince.</description>

      <description>UPDATE:
Welcome, Donald Trump fans! Thanks for reading.
Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s true, I have had disagreements with Erick in the past. I try to assess the situation, not just the person. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to disagree with someone on one subject and to agree with them on another.
If anything, Erick showed consistency by rescinding Trump&amp;rsquo;s invitation to Red State. Erick didn&amp;rsquo;t want the event to descend into chaos led by my friends over the Barbour episode; he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want a descent into chaos led by Donald Trump.</description>

      <description>I wrote previously that I hate elections.
I have many reasons for hating elections. One reason, though, seems pretty common: horrible, insulting radio ads.
Two ads really stick out:
 The negative ad that mentions the sponsoring candidate&amp;rsquo;s opponent(s) five times as often as it mentions the candidate you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to remember at the poll. The couple having a stilted, phony conversation about the sponsoring candidate using words and interruptions that no human being ever uttered or ever will.</description>

      <description>Now that Amendment 7 has gone down in flames, let&amp;rsquo;s look at highway funding in Missouri.
Amendment 7 would have authorized a 3/4 cent sales tax increase in Missouri. The money was intended for transportation in the broadest sense of the word. Parks with dirt paths qualify, since people can walk on the paths. Even if the bill tightened down the definition of transportation, municipalities and counties would have merely shifted funds to other projects and replaced that money with Amendment 7 taxes.</description>

A few weeks ago, hunkered down at my laptop in my hotel room in Jacksonville, Florida. I was exhausted from seven hours of travel and a time change. But I had to take a moment to recognize Ed Martin&amp;rsquo;s commitment to all the best the Republican Party stands for.
Ed is determined to expose the GOP establishment&amp;rsquo;s willingness to do anything to destroy grassroots insurgents. Thad Cochran&amp;rsquo;s forces in Mississippi threw ethics, morality, and decency to the wind in their quest to stop a Tea Party candidate from unseating the 128-term Cochran.</description>

With over 90% of the precincts counted in the Missouri primary, incumbent Congresswoman Ann Wagner has only 500 more votes than her November challenger, Democrat Arthur Lieber.

I get that this is a primary and that the St. Louis County Executive race drew a lot of attention. But Wagner won her seat in 2012 by 20 points.</description>

Seriously. The president&amp;rsquo;s family has no more authority than anyone else. The reason people show contempt for activist spouses of presidents is the same reason history hates Marie Antoinette.
I know, the all-Democrat Congress passed the school nutrition law in 2010, but Michelle Obama wrote it.
Michelle Obama has dictated that no tasty foods may enter any school property.Â That ban includesÂ school bake sales and snack shops which has PTOs scrambling to replace lost income.</description>

Tea Party Patriots picked St. Louis to host the Gateway to November rally under the Arch. Unlike our rag-tag events, this one would be professional all the way: live music with Sounding Fathers, speakers you heard ofÂ before the movement began in February 2009, and real security.
The guest speakers began rolling into town on Friday the tenth.</description>

      <description>You don&amp;rsquo;t hear the word &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; in political spin like you used to.
Back in the late 1980s when Jack Kemp, Pat Robertson, Pete DuPont, Al Haig, and George H. W. Bush were battling to replace

Ronald Reagan, &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; was in. Candidates fought for the title of &amp;ldquo;mainstream Republican,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;mainstream Conservative,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;mainstream everything.&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;m glad that word went away. But I&amp;rsquo;m bringing it back, if only for one blog post.</description>

      <title>Just Which Freedoms Are We Losing? </title>

      <description>I confess.
When I write about freedoms lost, I don&amp;rsquo;t itemize the freedoms. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel too bad, though, because almost no one does. Itemizing sucks.
First, it&amp;rsquo;s hard work. &amp;ldquo;Losing freedom,&amp;rdquo; takes about three seconds to type and less time to read. Listing freedoms,on the other hand, takes that much time just to highlight all the freedoms and click the un-ordered list button. God forbid I find myself working in straight HTML and have to hand-typeÂ &amp;quot;</description>

      <title>Surprised? Transportation Empowerment Act Was Ronald Reagan&#39;s IdeaâIn 1967!</title>

      <description>Last week I blogged that Ronald Reagan would love the Transportation Empowerment Act (TEA). I included audio of Reagan talking to Bill Buckley on Firing Line about the burden on states from onerous federal taxes and grants.
Forgive me, but that was sort of a tease. Here&amp;rsquo;s the meat: Reagan wrote a proposal for the Republican Governors&amp;rsquo; Conference of 1967 to allow states to keep about 2 percent of allÂ federalÂ taxes raised in the state.</description>

      <description>Proponents of Amendment 7 are telling a lot of lies. (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you, St. Louis Business Journal.) The biggest lie involves the quality of Missouri&amp;rsquo;s roads and bridges.
While Mayor Slay and the St. Louis Business Journal tell you Missouri&amp;rsquo;s roads are &amp;ldquo;crumbling,&amp;quot; two independent studies say the opposite. In fact, Missouri has some of the best roads in the country.

Not that the Establishment cares about Bond, but they want Medicaid expansion passed before they beg for money for 2016 from the Missouri Hospital Association and Chamber of Commerce.
Well, the St. Louis Post Dispatch asked Ashcroft about the deal, and he couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite bring himself to deny that he would pass Medicaid expansion if elected.</description>

Where do we go?
They&amp;rsquo;re on opposite sides of Amendment 7, the largest tax increase in Missouri history. And you need to choose a side before August 5, because the ball&amp;rsquo;s in the voters&amp;rsquo; court.
But there&amp;rsquo;s no need to fear; Hennessy is here. And I heard Francis the talking Mayor on KMOX this morning (or maybe it was yesterday) talking about how much he loves, Loves, LOVES the 3/4 cent sales tax increase theoretically for transportation.</description>

      <description>Want to fix Missouri&amp;rsquo;s roads and cut taxes at the same time? Well, two American conservative icons showed us the way almost 50 years ago.
The Establishment likes to attack grassroots conservatives by claiming Reagan would have opposed the Tea Party. They&amp;rsquo;re wrong, of course, and the Transportation Empowerment Act tells us why.
In 1967, shortly after Ronald Reagan became governor of California, William F. Buckley Jr. asked Governor Reagan if was even possible to be an effective governor.</description>

Yesterday, I blogged about calling myself a Republican. I was a kid.
Then, from about 1996 on, I called myself a conservative.
Over the past year or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken on the label of libertarian. Now, a simple online test confirms that I&amp;rsquo;m a right-leaning conservative. [Take the test yourself]
That&amp;rsquo;s exciting, because I feel like I need a new label.

      <description>AÂ Pyrrhic victoryÂ is a victory with such a devastating cost that it is tantamount to defeat. Someone who wins a Pyrrhic victory has been victorious in some way; however, the heavy toll negates any sense of achievement or profit (another term for this would be &amp;ldquo;hollow victory&amp;rdquo;).

Blood was its Avatar and its sealâthe rednessÂ and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stainsÂ upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men.</description>

      <description>Before we get to politics, I want to tell you about a business exercise.
The Universal Veto Game  Sometimes my job as a consultant involves helping people decide what to do when no ideas have a consensus. Sure, someone in a hierarchy can dictate terms, but dictated solutions don&amp;rsquo;t really work in business. Cooperation and collaboration are too important for success, and dictated terms are usually executed half-assed.
So we play this game.</description>

      <description>St. Louisan Eric Greitens did more before graduating from college than most people do in a lifetime. And, as if to insult us all, after college, Eric became a Navy SEAL.
In his remarkable book, The Heart and the Fist: The education of a humanitarian, the making of a Navy SEAL  , Greitens tells the story of a man who seems too good to be true. Seriously. And the book left me with two big impressions&amp;ndash;probably the wrong ones, but that&amp;rsquo;s how I am.</description>

      <title>3 Crystal-Clear Images From The Republican Primary De-Cantor</title>

      <description>âShellacked!â
That was the word that stuck out to me.
Eric Cantor, the Republican House Majority Leader led by 34 points according to his pollster. He lost by 10. Thatâs a shellacking.
Eric Cantor was the first sitting House Majority Leader ever knocked off in a primary. CantorÂ was also one of Wall Streetâs best friends and the embodiment of crony capitalismâthe disease eating the heart out of the GOP.</description>

      <description>You know how reckless and tone-deaf Obama is about Army deserters? Missouri&amp;rsquo;s House and Senate Republican leaders are just as clueless and irresponsible about money.
Yes, I said it: the Missouri Republican legislature is about as conservative and principled as Susan Rice on a Sunday talk show.
By going on a votes-for-cash spending spree on the last day of the General Assembly, the House and Senate handed Jay &amp;ldquo;Idiot&amp;rdquo; Nixon a PR prize worth its weight in pork.</description>

      <description>A lot of good people I know grumble that the House Republicans don&amp;rsquo;t try to impeach Obama.
I usually don&amp;rsquo;t say much in response. After the disaster of the ill-conceived Clinton impeachment fiasco,** impeachment seems like a superstition**. Like a unicorn. I think impeachment is a dangerous tool and should never be used for political purposes.
Besides, Harry Reid&amp;rsquo;s Senate wouldn&amp;rsquo;t consider articles of impeachment if they included NSA video of Obama throwing adorable, drooling toddlers off the George Washington Bridge.</description>

      <description>Not all casualties of war die in the field. Or even during hostilities.
We&amp;rsquo;ve learned that some of our warriors died because they landed on a &amp;ldquo;secret waiting list.&amp;rdquo;
Bureaucrats love pleasing their bosses. They live for it. In the case of the Veterans Administration, bureaucrats fired the final shot in the wars of at least 40 American warriors.
Sadly, the American government proved a deadlier foe than Hitler, Tito, Saddam, or bin Laden to some of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines.</description>

      <description>I knew it was getting late. I was leaving work, walking to my car, when I got a text message. My nephewÂ scored two tickets to Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.I texted my son, Patrick, to see if he was home. I planned to fly home, put on my Blues sweater, grab Patrick, and fly down to the Scot.
But Patrick didn&amp;rsquo;t need a ride or a ticket. He was already on his way to the game with a friend.</description>

      <description>I cried this morning. At work. Tears of shame.
Every day when I get to work, I go through a thirty-minute routine. I write down the 3 things I want to accomplish that day. I write down my appointments. I write down a one-sentence prayer. I copy a quote to guide me. With the time remaining, I learn one new thing.
Today that one thing I learned was humbling. Shameful, actually.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll give Business Insider some credit. After Tea Party-backed candidates came up empty across the board in Tuesday&amp;rsquo;s Republican primaries, the website that has spent years maligning our rule-of-law movement could have taken the low road.
Instead, blogger Brett Logiurato wrote a fair assessment of what&amp;rsquo;s happened to the GOP since February 27, 2009.
 The much-talked about Republican &amp;ldquo;civil war&amp;rdquo; is over, at least for the people who thought it even existed in the first place.</description>

      <description>If youâre reading this, the Blues blew it. Again.
Iâm writing this six hours before Game 6 against the Chicago Blackhawks. If I wait to write this after the game, Iâll get a lot of complaints about foul language.
Yes, I expect the Blackhawks to end the Bluesâ delusions of Market Street parades this afternoon. The Bluesâ tenacity, hitting, and heart canât overcome their lack of goal scoring and playoff goaltending.</description>

      <description>I told my nephew Scott that I was worried about the parallels between this year&amp;rsquo;s Stanley Cup Playoffs Round 1 and last year&amp;rsquo;s bitter collapse to the LA Kings.
That conversation happened last Sunday at an Easter party. The Blues were up 2-0 at the time, preparing for Game 3 in Chicago. My trepidation stemmed from the pattern emerging:
** Blues playing defending Stanley Cup Champions in Round 1 ** Steen wins Game 1 on overtime goal ** Jackman scores game winner in Game 2</description>

      <description>In 1977, the National Socialist Party (Nazi) applied to march and rally in Skokie, Illinois. Few communities want Nazis marching down their streets, but Skokie held a stronger case against the Nazis than most towns in America. About one person in every six of Skokie&amp;rsquo;s large Jewish population was a Nazi prison camp survivor.
 The debate was clear-cut: American Nazis claimed the right of free speech while their Jewish &amp;ldquo;targets&amp;rdquo; claimed the right to live without intimidation.</description>

      <description>I hope you read Jonah Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s short article on National Review Online last week. If not, you missed the best definition of Establishment Republicans EVER!
Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s piece also exploded the myth of &amp;ldquo;pro-business&amp;rdquo; way too many conservatives believe. Conservatism isn&amp;rsquo;t pro-business, it&amp;rsquo;s pro-market. I&amp;rsquo;ll let Jonah explain:
 Just to clarify, the difference between being pro-business and pro-market is categorical. A politician who is a âfriend of businessâ is exactly that, a guy who does favors for his friends.</description>

      <description>From the &amp;ldquo;see, I told ya so&amp;rdquo; file . . .
Rockwood NEA President Suzanne Dotta worked hard to influence the recent school board election. The candidates Ms. Dotta pushed won.
The new board hired Ms. Dotta as Director of Professional Learning within 72 hours of the election.
I expect Ms. Dotta to teach Rockwood&amp;rsquo;s professionals how to game the system for personal gain at taxpayer expense.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like to question this apparent quid pro quo, the next Rockwood Board meeting is April 24.</description>

      <description>Every inch of US territory is a Constitutionally guaranteed free-speech zone. I am all for arresting and prosecuting without mercy any government employee&amp;ndash;including military&amp;ndash;who attempt to limitÂ the size or scope of this zone.

During the Bundy Ranch standoff in Nevada, the Bureau of Land Management set up &amp;ldquo;free-speech zones.&amp;rdquo; I prefer to call them &amp;ldquo;First Amendment pens.&amp;rdquo;
The government uses these pens to segregate people. The US government says, &amp;ldquo;If you want to speak your mind, you may do so only within the pen.</description>

A Smart Manâs Stupid Argument for Gun Control A year ago, the gun control lobby pumped a Facebook post by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, one of my favorite thinkers.
In his post, Taleb argued that the Second Amendment means nothing because the federal government has massively superior firepower:</description>

 &amp;ndash;President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Farewell Address, 1961
A young man named Adam Weinstein recently called for incarceration of disbelievers in the cult of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming (CAGW). His argument mirrors the argument Goebbels used in 1930s to quash dissent from eugenics and to take immediate policy actions for the betterment of humanity.</description>

Apparently, Obama didn&amp;rsquo;t bow low enough to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. Whatever happened, an &amp;ldquo;intimate&amp;rdquo; evening planned for Obama and Abdullah was abruptly cancelled after a two-hour meeting between the two leaders. A meeting intended to &amp;ldquo;mend fences&amp;rdquo; between the two men.

I do. I like pesky guys full of gumption, like Vladimir Sobotka. I like energetic young political activists like Kenny Newhouse. And I like bold conservative organizers like Eileen Tyrrell. In fact, nothing pleases me more than seeing young, libertarian-ish Republicans making the establishment squirm.
Sometimes the squirming establishment is as small as a GOP township or a school district.</description>

      <description>This morning, a White House aide told reporters that Obamaâs sanctions are visibly âweakeningâ Putin and Russia.
Hours later, the White House recognizes that Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine could come any moment.
 Speaking from the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, Mike Rogers, the chair of the House of Representatives intelligence committee, said US intelligence officials were convinced âthat Putin is not done in Ukraineâ.
 Surprise. As Iâve written, Russian paranoia demands a larger sphere of influence and a large buffer of puppet governments, all the way to the German border with Poland.</description>

      <description>You saw Obama stand by as you threatened Georgia in 2009.
You heard Obama whisper to Medvedev that heâll be willing to defy Congress to capitulate to you after Obamaâs re-election.
You watched Obama and his bumbling Secretary of State mangle its its own strategy in Syriaâif the US ever had a Syrian strategy at all.
You saw that the US was completely unprepared for your annexation of Crimea.
You see the headlines of massive NSA spying on US citizens, though that same NSA was blind to your invasion of Ukraine.</description>

      <title>5 Secrets Politicians Don&#39;t Want You to Know</title>

      <description>How long has it been since you said, &amp;ldquo;they just don&amp;rsquo;t listen to us?&amp;rdquo;
By &amp;ldquo;they,&amp;rdquo; you mean politicians, of course. Maybe you feel they listen to lobbyists and big corporations and banksters, but they don&amp;rsquo;t listen to their constituents.
I have to agree with you. Politicians don&amp;rsquo;t listen to their constituents. They don&amp;rsquo;t even know who their constituents are.
They know demographics and statistics about their constituents, but that&amp;rsquo;s like saying you know how a banana tastes because you read a chemical assay report of its contents.</description>

      <description>Ask yourself this: why did the stock markets rally todayÂ afterÂ Obama announced sanctions against Russians? I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to that, but first some background.
I&amp;rsquo;ve often said that Putin plays chess while Obama fumbles with checkers. I picture our president, chin resting on fist, brows squeezed in childlike concentration, as he carefully chooses between jumping Putin&amp;rsquo;s piece to end the game or getting another of his pieces &amp;ldquo;kinged.&amp;rdquo;
Of course, Obama goes for the kingship.</description>

      <description>Do you live in Rockwood School District?
I do. My kids all went to Rockwood schools. My wife taught in a Rockwood school for three years.
The teachers in Rockwood tend to think a lot like the people who live here. They&amp;rsquo;re not a bunch of wacked-out lefties. Not most of them.
Still, that good education has come with HUGE price tag. Rockwood is one of the most expensive districts in Missouri.</description>

      <description>Did you ever read a book and think, &amp;ldquo;I need to tell people about this?&amp;rdquo;
Then you didn&amp;rsquo;t tell people about it. I mean, you didn&amp;rsquo;t blog about it. You didn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;officially&amp;rdquo; proclaim the book &amp;ldquo;required reading.&amp;rdquo;
Then something happened that you knew could happen because of the book, but you don&amp;rsquo;t get credit for calling it because you never got around to pumping the book.
That&amp;rsquo;s how I feel today.</description>

Do you sometimesÂ think anybody would do a better job than the incumbent? Do you feel you have no influence in Jefferson City, Springfield, or Washington? Do you feel that way because you don&amp;rsquo;t have thousands of dollars to donate and rich friends with oodles ofÂ cash you can bundle?
I feel that way all the time. Ask my friends Ben Evans and Michelle Moore.</description>

      <description>In the 1970s, a magazine ad for Benson &amp;amp; Hedges cigarettes portrayed a hockey fight. Two players slug it out. Sticks and gloves litter the ice.
The point of view is on-ice, in the midst of the scrum. The crowd is on its feet, banging the glass. You&amp;rsquo;re right there with linesmen trying to break it up.
The hockey gloves are Coopers. Every hockey player knows the name. In the photo, one of the gloves has been doctored.</description>

      <description>Senator Roy Blunt (HA-57) proposed that all Obamacare ads contain a disclaimer: &amp;ldquo;Paid for by the American Taxpayer.&amp;rdquo;
I get the idea. I can&amp;rsquo;t stand it when my tax dollars buy ads intended to raise my taxes. It means I&amp;rsquo;m fighting against myself.
Still, I don&amp;rsquo;t like Senator Blunt&amp;rsquo;s plan because I think it could backfire.
The Psychology of Ownership Right now, few people have a sense of ownership of Obamacare.</description>

** From near-spontaneous reaction to bailouts, corporate takeovers, and profligate government spending emerged the largest and most sustained political movement since the 1960s ** Both the GOP and Democrat Party are minority parties, as independents have surged ** A new generation identifies with libertarian ideals like freedom from government spying, freedom from failed wars on activities war was never meant to stop, insane spending, the opaque and manipulative Federal Reserve, government manipulation of information, IRS abuse of political groups, and Obamacare.</description>

      <description>Give all due credit to Rick Santelli. His rant inspired a movement.Â But words don&amp;rsquo;t wear boots.
More images like this one available at Doctor Bulldog: https://doctorbulldog.wordpress.com/2009/02/27/st-louis-tea-party-by-the-arch/  At 7:00 pm on February 20, Mike Leahy, Eric Odom, Jenny Beth Martin, Michelle Moore, Brooks Bayne, and a few others hijacked the TCOT conference call to answer Santelli&amp;rsquo;s call for a Tea Party in Chicago.
Two days after that, I posted this on Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View:St.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t know what got me onto this, exactly. I talked to Jim Durbin tonight, so maybe that was it.

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re going to hit me with the small sample size argument here, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay.
I firmly believe that the purpose of a company is to make life better, and if it does that well, it will make a profit. If, on the other hand, a company makes life worse, the market should let that company die.
Some companies try to improve life with insanely great technology products. Some make life better with fast, safe cars that are fun to drive.</description>

      <description>Karl Marx foresaw something that&amp;rsquo;s now playing out. As corporations cut labor costs to increase profits, they also destroy the markets for their goods and services.
This chart shows corporate profits (red) and wages as a percentage of GDP (blue) from 1944 to 2012:

When the blue line is higher than the red line, you get savings. For the red line to hang above the blue line, you need debt.</description>

      <description>I stand by my assessment that Chris Christie&amp;rsquo;s leadership and management played a role in the retaliatory shutdown of Fort Lee&amp;rsquo;s access lanes to the George Washington Bridge. Yesterday,I compared the GWB scandal to several Obama scandals. I pointed out that conservatives must apply the same standards to Christie as we did to Obama when the IRS scandal broke.
Today, let&amp;rsquo;s look at Christie&amp;rsquo;s response and contrast it to Obama&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>One argument put forth by conservatives&amp;ndash;and even some liberals&amp;ndash;regarding the IRS scandal was this:
Obama set a tone that encouraged IRS workers to harass conservative and Tea Party groups. He didn&amp;rsquo;t have to give a direct order. His tone and statements clearly condoned such criminal behavior toward his political enemies.
Kimberly Strassel at WSJ.com:
 Mr. Obama didn&amp;rsquo;t need to pick up the phone. All he needed to do was exactly what he did do, in full view, for three years: Publicly suggest that conservative political groups were engaged in nefarious deeds; publicly call out by name political opponents whom he&amp;rsquo;d like to see harassed; and publicly have his party pressure the IRS to take action.</description>

While cannabis may be have fewer harmful effects than alcohol and tobacco, someone who abstains from all three will be healthier mentally and physically than the same person smoking pot.
On the other hand, a lot proponents of prohibition throw around bad science, too.</description>

      <description>Ben Sasse wants to break the back of lobbying and crony capitalism by moving the seat of government from Washington to Nebraska. Sasse is a Republican candidate for US Senate from Nebraska.
Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to cripple lobbying? But Sasse&amp;rsquo;s plan won&amp;rsquo;t cripple lobbying. It will inconvenience lobbyists for a year while they resettle in the Midwest. Then it&amp;rsquo;s back to business as usual.
Before you throw up your hands and say &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s hopeless,&amp;rdquo; here&amp;rsquo;s an idea that might actually end lobbying as we know it.</description>

      <description>I blog about tea party stuff 90 percent of the time. I get decent readership with those blogs, and I appreciate my loyal followers. Very much.
But as long as I write about stuff only conservatives and activist libertarians care about, only conservatives and libertarians will read my blog. That means our ideas won&amp;rsquo;t escape the echo chamber we&amp;rsquo;ve been yelling in for years.
When I write about the conservative/libertarian perspective on issues of wider interest, though, I bring in people who never otherwise readÂ our views.</description>

Spinks had the whole world served up on a plate. He tried to eat it all at once. He choked on it.</description>

      <description>The other one was 1975. At least in my lifetime.
1975 was weird for good reasons and bad. Saturday Night Live debuted with the Not Ready For Prime Time Players: Dan Akroyd, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtain, Gilda Radner, and Garrett Morris. President Gerald Ford tried to stop inflation with WIN buttons (seriously). New York City faced bankruptcy, but, after initially saying &amp;lsquo;drop dead,&amp;rsquo; Gerry Ford ended up bailing it out with $2.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered why moments end?
I wrote about the Irish Moment and the Jewish Moment and the Gay Moment on Saturday. Three Moments enjoyed by identifiable groups of Americans. Moments that ended when the groups joined the main plot of the American story, leaving the artistic sub-plot to the next in line.
Demographics offer only one kind of Moment, though. There are cultural moments and fashion moments and, of course, political moments.</description>

      <title>Why Christmas 2013 Is The Most Important Christmas Ever</title>

      <description>The only Christmas I remember getting everything I wanted was in 1975.
First, I was finally old enough (12) to not be so shallow and needy and get pissed off if I didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly what I wanted. Santa Claus and my parents and sisters were really good to me, but until 1975 I could still get worked up if the Erector Set I got wasn&amp;rsquo;t the 118-piece set with real electric motor.</description>

      <description>The vices are, indeed, let loose, and they wander and do damage. But the virtues are let loose also; and the virtues wander more wildly, and the virtues do more terrible damage. The modern world is full of the old Christian virtues gone mad. The virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone. Thus some scientists care for truth; and their truth is pitiless.</description>

Everett Johnson, a lawyer representing the ghosts, says he will begin negotiations with the townâs haunted house tour guides, spirit shops, and even owners of haunted properties.
âThe living have been exploiting these tortured souls for decades,â Johnson told Hennessyâs View.</description>

And they&amp;rsquo;re all wrong.
I checked with NOAA on record temperature maximums in the US on December 21, 2013. There were none.

      <description>Have you ever seen a moment end?
I watchedÂ Duck Dynasty once or twice. I don&amp;rsquo;t get it.
That makes me different. Fourteen million people watch the show every week. That&amp;rsquo;s more than watch any other show on television. Clearly, I&amp;rsquo;m a little odd, especially among conservatives.
That&amp;rsquo;s okay. I&amp;rsquo;m used to being weird.
I never expected that a reality TV show would stop a &amp;ldquo;moment.&amp;rdquo; But that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what&amp;rsquo;s happened.</description>

      <description>I nearly killed my nephew, Scott, when he was about seven-years-old. I was 15 or so.
We were at Sunnen Lake near Potosi, Missouri. My dad worked at Sunnen Products, and the company provided Sunnen Lake as a free recreation spot for employees and retirees. (Pretty cool perk.)
The recreation complex was pretty rustic then. About ten cabins, a recreation hall with ping-pong and a huge fireplace. The big parking lot near the Rec Hall was covered with pea-size brown and tan gravel held in place by an eight-inch railroad tie wall.</description>

&amp;ldquo;You know how big a deal that is?&amp;rdquo;

I looked through some of Darin Morley&amp;rsquo;s excellent videos on YouTube.I searched &amp;ldquo;St. Louis Tea Party&amp;rdquo; on duckduckgo.com.
Have you thought about what&amp;rsquo;s happened?

      <description>Before I answer that, a little science.
Scientists study all kinds of things. One thing they study is ants, because ants teach a lot about communities.
In a recent study published inÂ Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, ecologistsÂ ShigetoÂ Dobata and Kazuki Tsuji studied the effects of &amp;ldquo;cheaters&amp;rdquo; in a colony ofÂ Pristomyrmex Punctatus ants.
P.Â PunctatiÂ segment their society into two groups by age. Younger ants tend to hang around the house reproducing asexually.</description>

      <description>I can be pretty hard on Republicans. Not hard enough for some. Too hard for others.
But I, at least, try to time my battles for ideological consistency. As a general rule, odd-numbered years are for cleaning up the GOP. Even-numbered years are for cleaning out Democrats.
This is an odd-numbered year. Right up to the votes on the continuing resolution,my primary targets were Republicans, especially Roy Blunt.
Once the House exercised its Constitutional power of the purse strings, sending a popular continuing resolution to the Senate, the battle lines shifted.</description>

      <description>Lowell Weicker was a RINO. So was Lincoln Chaffe for a while. And John Linsday, the mayor who tried to destroy New York City in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
RINO stands for &amp;ldquo;Republican In Name Only.&amp;rdquo; Rhinos and Elephants are both pachyderms, so it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty clever name for people who join the Republican Party but prefer the Democrat platform.
The problem is, some people take the concept to extremes.</description>

 &amp;ldquo;Iâm a reasonable guy. But I didnât come to Washington to be a congressman. I came to do something for my country.&amp;rdquo;
 Write that down. That statement echos.
Research shows thatpeople motivated by doing, by getting better, by learning, will work harder and stay truer to their principles than people motivated by demonstrating how good they are&amp;ndash;being something.</description>

      <description>Yeah, I know. Obama&amp;rsquo;s childish, petulant, and tyrannical tantrums over the continuing resolution makes me want to fight like an angry cat, too.
But I don&amp;rsquo;t actually want to fight. Fighting isn&amp;rsquo;t in our interest. As Sun Tzu said:
 Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is notÂ supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy&amp;rsquo;sÂ resistance without fighting.
 I want to succeed in repealing Obamacare and forcing government into its constitutionally limited box.</description>

WWII Veterans asked the White House for permission to visit the World War II Memorial in case of a shutdown. The veterans are part of the Honor Flights program that helps aging veterans visit the WWII Memorial.
Even though there&amp;rsquo;s no cost involved, the White House chose to dishonor the veterans&amp;rsquo; request. It send forth &amp;ldquo;goons,&amp;rdquo; in Senator Paul&amp;rsquo;s works, to erect barricades around the memorial.</description>

      <description>I was wrong.
As the continuing resolution fight approached, I expected House Republicans to cave. I expected Boehner to make a half-hearted attempt to use debt ceiling, instead of continuing resolution, as leverage to stop Obamacare. And I expected Republican Senators to make a stand.
But that&amp;rsquo;s not what happened.
In reverse order, Senate Republican leadership ran away from confrontation like schoolgirls spying a snake. Led by Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, and Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Junior Senator Roy Blunt, the GOP attacked Senators Mike Lee and Ted Cruz instead of Obamacare.</description>

That was the Boston Tea Party.
Look at us now! People furious with me for going after Senator Roy Blunt. I went after him because he announced he will vote for cloture knowing full well that cloture give Harry Reid his only chance to strip the House&amp;rsquo;s Obamacare defund language from the continuing resolution.</description>

      <title>How Roy Blunt Failed Missouri Today</title>

      <description>The Republican primary for US Senate in 2016 will actually be a battle for an empty seat. Roy Blunt effectively abdicated his throne today.
This morning, I showed where Missouri stands on Obamacare.
I&amp;rsquo;ve called, written, and tweeted to Roy Blunt. So have thousands of other Missourians. And so have Americans across the country.
I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised that Roy Blunt failed to publicly join Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s filibuster.Â That kind of daring commitment to principle just isn&amp;rsquo;t in his character.</description>

      <title>How Lonely Is Roy Blunt?</title>

      <description>Imagine how isolated Roy Blunt must feel.
Senator Blunt is a party man. He believes in following leadership. He doesnât rock the boat.
And his leader, Senate Minority Leader Slick Mitch McConnell, has decided to help Harry Reid get the 60 votes needed to invoke cloture on the continuing resolution. Once debate closes (via cloture), Reid will strip the Houseâs defund language from the bill and pass it.
Senate Republican leadership wants defund language stripped.</description>

      <title>Mitch McConnell Vows To Help Harry Reid Fund Obamacare</title>

      <description>Harry Reid needs six Republicans to fund Obamacare.Â Mitch McConnell signed up immediately.
In a statement, McConnell announced he plans to vote against Obamacare by voting for cloture, allowing Harry Reid to strike the defunding language from the bill.
McConnell will, of course, vote nay on the final bill. But that&amp;rsquo;s just a gimmick.
McConnell&amp;rsquo;s slick maneuver is short-sighted. It will bite him.Â  Slick Mitch knows as well as anyone that Obamacare is a disaster for the American people.</description>

The AARP has just one objective: to transfer the future income of the young and the unborn to people over 50.
Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s completely immoral. The AARP is like the father who used his kid&amp;rsquo;s Social Security Number to run up a ton of debt, then defaults. The kid is left with a permanently damaged credit rating, which prevents him from getting a good job or an affordable house.</description>

      <description>I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d have to ask.
In Nairobi, Kenya, al Qaeda terrorists stormed an upscale mall yesterday to kill all the Christians.So far, 59 are dead and at least 175 wounded. Another 30 or so hostages remain inside with the terrorists.Kenyan police are hunting the terrorists and attempting to free the hostages.
The USA, surely, is on the side of the Kenyan authorities. Right?
Well, last week, President Obama waived (aka, violated) a US law that prohibited the arming of terrorists and terrorist-linked groups.</description>

Some people created private government by suppressing others. Some people created public government through voluntary cooperation with others. Public governments rule people. Public government serve people. Public governments foster human achievement. Private governments suppress human achievement. Private governments tell people what they can do. Public governments do what people allow. Private governments seek to maximize the power of the ruling class.</description>

      <description>I had no idea this was coming when I wrote my blog post on gratitude at midnight.
From Heritage Action for America:
   This morning, House leaders announced they would pass a continuing resolution that funds the government but defunds Obamacare this week.
 In many ways, todayâs announcement represents âa victoryâ¦for the GOPâs conservative wing and its tea-party allies.â (Wall Street Journal) However, it also represents a victory for the tens of thousands of workers who have seen their hours cut thanks to Obamacare and to the patients searching for new doctors.</description>

And I hated when someone tried to break those foul moods.
Wouldnât you know it. My mom said, âcount your blessings.â
Yeah. What blessings? We lost! Wasnât she listening?
I was a real peach.
It turns out, my mom was right.</description>

      <description>John Kerry isnât fit for Secretary of State, and the whole world knows it.
If Obama every had a strategy for Syria, John Kerry destroyed it in a matter of minutes Monday.
First, Kerry said any American response to unspeakable humanitarian crisis in Syria would be âunbelievably small.â Man, you know that fired up the Marines floating off the coast of Syria.

      <description>Obama pitched war to a war-weary America, and all he got back was a yawn.
Tonightâs speech was touted as the most important of his life. I doubt many will remember in 3 years.
âI have asked Congress to find something else to do for a couple of weeks,â seemed to be the theme. Or âthereâs something wrong with you people for wanting to bomb a Middle East country. I mean, theyâre Muslims for Godâs sake.</description>

      <description>Eric Cantorâs latest tactic in the battle to defund Obamacare reminds me of the Trojan Rabbit in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
According to Business Insiderâs Josh Barro:
 It&amp;rsquo;s a strategy predicated on the idea that Republican activists are stupid. Many of them are stupid. But they&amp;rsquo;re not stupid enough to fall for this.
 (Barro is hard-left, btw.)
From what I can gather, Cantor intends to pass two continuing resolutions out of the House.</description>

      <description>The White House admits it has no hard evidence that the Syrian government launched the alleged chemical weapons attack.
Instead, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough told the Associated Press âa common sense testâ implicates the Syrian government.
Well, no, it doesnât. Quite the opposite, in fact.
Chemical weapons attacks are signs of desperation. But Assadâs forces have recently gained the upper hand against rebels according to numerous sources.</description>

      <description>I got four emails from Republican candidates today. They all sucked.
Iâve made every mistake they made, so I wonât beat anyone up over it.
But if conservative candidates want to win elections, they have to becomeâor hireâexcellent marketers.
Everybody freaks out about the Democrat advantage in data, analytics, and social. But 80 percent of that gap is good execution of scientifically established marketing principles.
Republicans tend to despise marketing. They reject psychology.</description>

And I am sick of American troops leaving our shores filled with vigor and ambition and hope only to return disillusioned, scarred, maimed, or dead.Â On this, left and right are beginning to agree.
Here are just some of the wars we fought half-assed in my lifetime:
 Vietnam El Salvador/Nicaragua Libya Iraq I Iraq II Afghanistan  By âhalf-assed,â I mean sending troops into harms way with no better purpose than to stop fighting on some arbitrary date and time.</description>

I will not vote for anyone in Congress who votes to authorize bombing in Syria, and I&amp;rsquo;ve notified my US Representative Ann Wagner and Senator Roy Blunt. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:
  I am far from convinced that the chemical attack was perpetrated by the government. Terrorism expertÂ Yosef Brodansky reported that the preponderance of evidence indicates Syrian rebels released the sarin attack.</description>

      <description>The House GOP leadership has a problem.
The conservative base wants Boehner to use the continuing resolution to force a showdown over Obamacare. Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin, Sean Hannity, and millions of grassroots activists want the GOP to block passage of a continuing resolution because it funds the unpopular healthcare law.
Boehner doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to. He&amp;rsquo;s afraid that shutting down the government will hurt Republicans in the 2014 election.

      <description>I just finished Level 1 Training with the Center for Self-Governance. While I have a long way to go to complete the training, I can tell you I needed this. Bad.
What I Didnât Know I Didnât Know Itâs not that I was stupid before. And some of the political action Iâve been doing my whole adult life was affective, I learned.
The problem is, I didnât know whether or not it was effective.</description>

      <description>Iâll let one of my favorite thinkers, St. Louis native Don Peppers, tell about St. Louis in 1850:
 My hometown of St. Louis, Missouri was the largest city west of the Mississippi River in 1850, and the second largest port city in the entire country. Only New York handled more tonnage than the riverboats that docked, often more than a hundred at a time, at the St. Louis levee. Among other things, the riverboats supplied equipment, people, horses, and other materials to a burgeoning population of pioneers who rode wagon trains out from St.</description>

      <description>Iâm not a lawyer. And Iâm not particularly smart. But that doesnât stop me from writing my opinion.
Rather, Iâm a libertarian-ish conservative. I like a small central government that protects us from evil people in other countries and delivers mail. And prosecutes people who do great harm across state lines.
The Supreme Court has two big gay marriage cases pending. At issue:
  Do the people of California have the right to define marriage in their state?</description>

      <description>Get into the spirit of â76 with a great live musical You probably didnât know that I was a theatre guy in high school and college. In fact, I was a theatre major for a couple of years. I think the rightâs neglect of the arts is one of our biggest failings. The arts reach people at an emotional level. Intellectual arguments cannot change emotional attachments.
So hereâs a chance to rev up your American patriotic spirits while connecting with the arts.</description>

      <description>They were all looking at me. Staring, actually.
I looked around the silent sales room. No one blinked. They were all stunned.
For twenty minutes, I&amp;rsquo;d laid on a coating of bullshit that would have made Bill Clinton cringe. And it worked. I sold a year of lawn care to a woman who, at first, thought our service was an environmental menace.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a coward.
It was the final zone inspection of boot camp. Navy Recruit Training. Get hit in this inspection, and youâre set back a week. Maybe two weeks.
My mom and dad had already booked a hotel room in Orlando. They couldnât wait to see their son pass in review.
I knew everything in my area was perfect. My rack (bunk) was made to perfection. Every garment of clothing was folded to its ridiculous, bizarre specification.</description>

      <description>David Hanneberry lost the love of his life in the capture of Suspect Twoâhis boat.
@ColorMeRed inspired the idea of buying him a new one.
Iâve started a GoFundMe account to raise $30,000 in 30 days to fund a new boat for Mr. Hanneberry. Câmon, folks, this guyâs a hero. He discovered Tsarnaev in his boat and called the cops. He had the courage to lift the canvas and verify that the bastard was in in there.</description>

      <description>The police in Watertown responded magnificently. But the most brilliant strategic move gets little notice from the press.

For about sixteen hours, hundreds of law officers, FBI agents, helicopters, and satellites scoured a relatively tiny area of Boston suburbs for one wounded terrorist. At the same time, they kept the public relatively safe, off the streets, and out of the way of their manhunt.
**But they didnât find their man.</description>

      <description>Iâm in San Francisco this week. Iâm taking notes.
I just walked past a carbon-copy of my little doggy Stella guarding her homeless master who was sleeping on the stoop of a building at 8th and Mission. They were the first two people on the street who weren&amp;rsquo;t smoking dope.

Then it dawned on me. In San Francisco, there is no opportunity for people at the bottom to climb up to the top.</description>

 Definitions &amp;hellip; the term &amp;lsquo;terrorism&amp;rsquo; means premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents;
 Letâs stick with that one. To be terrorism, all of these five elements must be present. You can use it as a checklist:</description>

      <description>Why do our members of Congress disappoint us?
Why do they seem to put their personal interests ahead of the mission we elected them to do?
More importantly, how we can we deter Republicans or bring them back to the fold?
Study Shows How Communities Keep Members In Line New research by University of Oxford and the ETH Zurich could provide an answer: one strong leader.
When non-cheating members of a community empowered a strong member to challenge the anti-social cheater, the cheating stopped.</description>

      <description>President Obama submitted a budget wildly out of balance that increases taxes across the board. But he also stuck his tongue on the infamous âthird railâ of American politics by proposing chained CPI for calculating Social Security cost of living increases. Bravo.

      <description>This post is a bit unusual for me.
Strange and disturbing thoughts crowded my mind tonightâSunday, March 7.
These thoughts interrupted my television viewing. I couldnât really focus. Then, I couldnât sleep. The thoughts wonât rest, and they wonât give me rest. So I write.
Iâm bewildered by the worldâs stock markets. Someone told the Wall Street Journal that, sure, the US economy seems to be tanking, manufacturingâs falling, the labor rateâs in the toilet.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t ask me to explainÂ why the human brain works the way it does. And don&amp;rsquo;t ask me how scientists get the idea for some experiments.
Instead, take note of the most influential work in the English language, because I want you to be more influential.
What&amp;rsquo;s that one word?
It&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;instantly&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;new.&amp;rdquo; They&amp;rsquo;re very powerful words, as every copywriter knows. But they&amp;rsquo;re notÂ the most influential.</description>

      <description>Our old friends John and Gina Loudon appear on ABCâs Celebrity Wife Swap this Thursday, March 28.
A lot of my friends have asked âwhat were they thinking?â
Dr. Gina explains what they were thinking:
My Take
The Loudons took a big gamble. Itâs about time someone did.
Gina is dead on. As Iâve been saying for awhile, we have to break out of our affinity bubbles. That means going to places we might not be accepted.</description>

      <description>Reuters reports (via ZeroHedge) that Switzerland has reached a secret deal with the United States to assist the US government in conducted a Cyprus-style confiscation of deposits held in Swiss bank accounts.
 The question then is: how many of the oligarchs, Russian or otherwise, who avoided a complete wipe out and total capital controls in Cyprus, will wait to find out if the same fate will befall them in Switzerland?</description>

      <description>The RNCâs Autopsy report wants to do away with caucuses and conventions, replacing them with regional primaries. But Iâll propose a different reform that will make candidate selection more interesting, whether in a caucus or a primary.
A Word About The Autopsy The idea of compacting the primary season and eliminating caucuses has some merit, but also a lot of downside. On the plus side are splashier events to showcase the party, fewer Tuesdays littered with politics, and, believe it or not, some economies as candidates can focus on one geographical region at a time.</description>

Americans Believe In Federalism In polls, Americans are consistent: the US government must not impose its morals on states regarding marijuana. After ballot measures in Colorado and Washington approved legalization of pot, Gallup asked whether the United States should honor the will of the people.</description>

      <description>Iâm using abortion as an example, but this bit of science applies to all political messaging.
Whatâs wrong with this headline?

Iâll tell you whatâs wrong with it. It shouts: âEverybodyâs getting an abortion!â Even if connected with messages that say abortion is wrong.
In numerous studies, messages intended to discourage a behavior by promoting the number of people engaged in the behavior (called negative social proof) actually caused the behavior to increase.</description>

Proposition P is an easy No vote.
Proposition P is a sales tax increase that would drive up the cost of everything you buy in St. Louis City and County. St. Charles County already opted out of the tax, because they knew the money would be frittered away.</description>

      <description>The GOPâs self-examination on the 2012 election debacle rightly identifies marketing and messaging and lack of a ground game as contributors to that mess.

But the GOPâs self-exam missed a potentially fatal problem for the party: the American people simply do not trust Republicans on the budget.
Read this paragraph from The Hill carefully. Read all of it. It should tell you everything you need to know.
 More voters trust the Democratic Party than the Republican Party on budgetary issues, according to the results of a new poll for The Hill â even though a strong majority actually prefer Republican fiscal policies [emphases added].</description>

      <description>An enduring criticism of the Church over a millennium involves its wealth and opulence. Its cathedrals were often theÂ most expensive and ornate structures in entire nations, save for monarchâs palaces. Lavish ceremonies mark significant milestones, such as the installation of a new pope.

So Pope Francisâs instruction to the bishops and faithful of his homeland Argentina says everything about why this pope will be different from all other popes.</description>

They compromise, and she gets one implant.
Is this the best outcome?
No!Â Itâs the worst possible outcome. Either of the two other outcomesâno implants or twoâwould be better than the compromise.
So why are Americans so infatuated with political compromise that leaves the country more lopsided?

Those were the words of Missouri State Senator Kurt Schaefer to Director of Revenue Brian K. Long in a heated hearing at the Missouri State Capitol this morning.

Senator Schaefer and researchers at the Missouri Family Network, who broke this story, learned prior to the hearing that Longâs department has ordered Missouri fee office workers to violate state law by collecting and storing personal identifying information (PII) on everyone who renews a driverâs license, non-driver ID, or concealed carry permit in Missouri.</description>

      <description>A lot. Marijuana prohibition costs enough to put more than 900 new police officers on the streets.
Hereâs the numbers from Harvard and Cato scholar Jeffrey A. Miron and marijuana law reform researcher Abhi Sivasailam (via Show-Me Cannabis):
 Missouri would save about $90 million in government expenditure and yield roughly $59 million in tax revenue annually. This assumes that marijuana would be taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco and that all other states and the federal government would also legalize.</description>

 McCain lost his cool with Rand Paul and sounded like the old man down the street screaming to the new kids on the block, âGet off my lawn!â
 The real reason McCain and Lindsey Graham embarrassed themselves on the floor of Senate had nothing to do with what Rand Paul said. Rand Paul&amp;rsquo;s ideas terrify McCain, Graham, and most of the Republican establishment.</description>

He&amp;rsquo;s afraid. Afraid that, after he&amp;rsquo;s gone, his political widow will remarry someone younger, sexier, more fun.
Thursday, March 7, 2013: Senate Office Building, Washington, DC In the dark cloisters of his Senate office, McCain leans back in his chair, tie loosened, jacket tossed casually over a guest chair, fingers interlaced behind his white head, and broods.
He sees those rascally young libertarians&amp;ndash;the ones who actually want to own their own lives&amp;ndash;plunging into the party.</description>

      <description>Mary is a good student, and a tad independent. At 18, sheâs getting ready to graduate from a Catholic high school with honors.

And every once in a while, Mary smokes pot with her friendsâfriends sheâs had since grade school.
Leaving a concert at US Bank Pavilion, Mary and her friends stop at Dennyâs. In Maryâs purse is a dime bag of pot. Itâs been there for weeks, and she hasnât really thought it.</description>

      <description>Unless you just want to vent, the reason you post things on Twitter is to influence people. But you canât influence people who donât see your tweets. **The more people who see your tweets, the more influential you are. **So you should increase your Twitter followers.

How can you increase your followers?Â Research at Georgia Tech gives you the answer.
Twitter Things To Do Be Positive. Positive tweets are more likely to be retweeted and people who use positive words have more followers.</description>

      <title>Republicans Lose Because They Donât Attract Enough Conservatives</title>

      <description>For 20 years, the Battleground Poll of States (now the Politico/GW Battleground Poll) showed a freakish consistency about ideology.
2009: 59% Conservative 
 2012: 57% Conservative 
With almost 60% calling themselves somewhat or very conservative, how could Barack Obama get re-elected? How could Republicans fail to gain the Senate in 2010 and 2012? Come to think of it, how do Democrats win at all?
The answer is simple: being conservative doesnât make you Republican, but being Democrat makes you a liberal.</description>

      <description>One of the most powerful tools of influence is fear.
Decades of research shows that fear of loss is about three times as motivating as hope for gain. (This changes under certain situations, like conditions of certain loss, but thatâs for another time.)
So political message writers often use negative messages to influence voters to take a chance on a cause or a candidate.
This tactic works well with Republican voters, and less well with Democrats.</description>

Wait, that wasnât the punch line.
That ambition changed, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad it did. It was a bad ambition.
Steve Jobs wanted to build an enduring company that made insanely great products that people loved. Thank God he pursued and achieved his ambition, because it was good and noble.
Whatâs the difference? Itâs not that one ambition was personal and one involved others.</description>

On the second vote, the bail-out passed, and they ascended into The Fed. They are seated at the right hand of Government from whence they shall come to lobby for tax breaks with more debt.</description>

      <description>**If Republicans want to put their liberty where their mouths are, they can begin by ending the war on weed. **
When I was a kid in South St. Louis in the 70s, marijuana was the weed in the field that separated traditional post-war American values from the hippies. It was an easy black-and-white issue: smoke dope, youâre un-American. It was the Boomers against the Greatest Generation, and no one questioned the pure evil of pot.</description>

      <description>I agree with Republican Senator Corker that inflation is a danger in the future. But inflation doesnât win the hearts and minds of most Americans right now. No oneâs worried about it except economists and economics geeks.
The death of the community and regional bank, however, does bother people. As does the printing of money that goes straight into the 5 biggest banks in history . . . and stays there.</description>

      <description>The motivating force behind the first tea party protests of February 27, 2009, was , in part, crony capitalism. Across the country and on the steps of the Arch in St. Louis, signs and speakers denounced bailouts for failed businesses.
Rasmussen found that 68 percent of Americans believe Big Business and Big Government work together against the rest of us.
I think theyâre right.
Since then, crony capitalism has only grown.</description>

Well, grow up, Republicans. (Have you ever listened to Rush Limbaugh?)
Now to the meat of the story.

      <description>Marco Rubio gave the Republican response to the State of the Union address for two reasons.
First, Rubioâs Cuban, and the GOP wants to court Latinos.
Second, Rubioâs relatively young, and the GOP wants to stop the bleeding when it comes to young voters.
But thereâs a fundamental problem with the Republican approach, and it stems from the GOPâs least favorite discipline: behavioral science.
Young People Are Naturally Skeptical You hear about scams that target older folks all the time.</description>

      <description>WelcomeÂ Dr. Gina ShowÂ Listeners!
Republicans should announce âthe sequester wonât be so badâ and shut up, and science tells us why.
Obama, the Dems, liberal pundits, the press, and even John Boehner are running around yelling about how horrible the sequester will be.
In some deep recesses of our minds, we agree.Â âOh, my God! Weâre all going to do die!â
Fear-mongering only works in the future because, in short, nothing is as bad (or as good) as we think it will be when we think about it.</description>

      <description>Every election cycle millions of reliable Republican voters die and even more millions of Democrat voters get the vote. Messaging and pandering wonât fix the problem. Reforming the party might.
Libertarian reforms offer the best hope, because all the other conservative factions â evangelicals, Second Amendment, home schoolers, fiscal &amp;ndash; have hit their high-water marks. We saw that in 2012. Liberty, however, sells with the kids. Or it might, if Republicans would try it.</description>

She sneaks downstairs and puts on her make-up in front of the TV. She also encrypts mysterious lesson plans into a little black book. Names and numbers.</description>

The Missouri Chambermaids of Cronyism Hereâs the simple truth: the Missouri Chamber of Commerce is not conservative. It does not exist to advance limited government and fiscal responsibility and free enterprise capitalism. The Missouri Chamber of Commerce has become convinced that it must lie down before government and beg for scraps from the federal table.</description>

Daniel Kahneman is a psychologist who won a Nobel in economics for Prospect Theory, more commonly called Behavioral Economics. In his book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman describes a cognitive bias that leads people to make the wrong choice on automobiles. But the bias might actually keep gasoline consumption high by fooling people with number.

The language barrier that separates people like Buckley from that odd species we call Congress prevented his thoughts from finding fertile soil.

      <description>When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for conservatives to divorce themselves from superstitions theyâve embraced since the Progressive Movement of the 1920s and join the pantheon of reasonable people, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
I hold these truths to be totally frigginâ obvious, that all drugs are not created equal, that weâve wasted billions of dollars and millions of lives pursuing a** demented âzero toleranceâ temperance goal that was Never Going To Happen**, that the losses weâve endured trying stamp out weed have cost American society more than they&amp;rsquo;ve gained, that among these losses are lives, money, and opportunity.</description>

The Republican Primary season was already well underway. Before a single caucus or vote, though, we pretty much knew that Mitt Romney would win the nomination. He had the entire Republican establishment behind him, including true conservatives who wanted a âsafeâ candidate.
We know how that worked out.

What might have been had a strong conservative emerged in 2011? What if someone without baggage had prepared years in advance for a run against the weakened, staggering Obama?</description>

      <description>Answer this question on paper without looking up the answer:
 Q:Â Which kills more people: guns or diabetes?
 Hereâs what your brain is doing. Itâs searching your memory for mentions of the keywords: âguns,â âdiabetes,â and âkill.â
For most of us, one of the variablesâguns or diabetesâcarries a significantly heavier emotional weighting than the other. A paid-up-for-life member of the NRA might attach powerful positive emotions to âguns.â The parent of a child who died of complications of diabetes will attach high negative emotions to âdiabetes.</description>

      <description>Friedrich Hayek warned more than half a century ago that central planningÂ doesn&amp;rsquo;tÂ work. Hereâs why:
 * Central Planners (government) makes a plan * The plan includes specific expectations * The expectations are never, ever, realized * A âcrisisâ ensues * So the planners demand more control * And create more plans * Ad hoc * Willy nilly * Capriciously * So you must wait for things to settle down to make your decision  Todayâs Wall Street Journal article about the fiscal cliff demonstrates the futility of central planning:</description>

      <description>I read today that the Christmas shopping season was off. The writer, or his sources, blamed Sandy: Hurricane Sandy and Sandy Hook. Retailers said that shoppers werenât very jolly. They were serious or worried or distracted. Hurried, as if they didnât want to be out too long.

I thought of my parents and others at the Christmas of 1941. Americans had endured a decade of economic depression that the planners were impotent to correct.</description>

Remember this chart from last month? It shows strategic options from John Boehnerâs point of view:

Yesterday, Boehner tried to land about halfway between the top and bottom quadrant on the left, shown here

Now that Plan B has been rejected, Boehnerâs choices are limited to these: * Adjourn and hit the fiscal cliff * Cut a deal that will earn most Democrat votes and enough Republican votes to pass</description>

English was my favorite subject in school, so much so that I can still recite from memory large passages of the books we read, like A Separate Peace:
 I went back to Devon School not long ago, and found it looking oddly newer than when I was a student there 15 years before.
 And who doesnât know this by heart:
 If you really want to hear about it, the first thing youâll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I donât feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.</description>

      <description>For the past four years. conservatives have worried more about being right while liberals worried about winning.
We all know how that worked out.
It doesnât matter how right you are if youâre powerless.Right now we are.
Satisfied?
I didnât think so.

After four years of 5,000 Leap and Constitution study groups, of Constitutional workshops, and rallies in the park, letâs make a vow to ourselves and to each other: Weâre Done With Losing.</description>

Theyâre dead.

To survive, the GOP needs to stop being afraid of Millennials and tell them truth: they can move out of mom and dadâs house, they can drop out of school, they can quit their dead-end job with the idiot supervisor. But they canât get away from government and debt.</description>

      <description>Iâve gotten a lot of emails and comments asking for more information on the special election process in Missouriâs 8th Congressional District. So I went to the smartest person I know about this stuff: Frieda Keough.
Hereâ what I learned:
 Eddie Justice, the Chair of the 8th Congressional District will call a meeting. Anyone wanting to be appointed to run for the 8th Congressional District shows up at the meeting and will be put before the committee.</description>

      <description>I bet ten bucks on a sentimental favorite to win. Sure, heâs old, and reports say he didnât train as hard as he might have. But heâs been my boxing hero since childhoodâwhen he won the gold at the Olympics. Iâm sure thereâs another moment of glory waiting to explode on an unsuspecting world.
He just needs to land that one magical right.

      <description>In an open Republican primary in Missouriâs 8th Congressional District, a solid conservative would beat an establishment &amp;ldquo;my turn&amp;rdquo; Republican, hands down. And the Missouri GOP would hate it.
Thatâs why I smell a rat. Would you be surprised to learn that Jo Ann Emerson and Lloyd Smith had this switcheroo planned months ago?Â You have to admit that the timing is suspicious:
 * Emerson wins a certain re-election * Smith announces he&#39;s stepping down as Missouri GOP Executive Director * Emerson announces she&#39;s resigning to become Queen of Lobbyists * Missouri&#39;s GOP Establishment breaks hips to tell reporters &amp;quot;Lloyd Smith&#39;s our man!</description>

      <description>Encouraging Boehner to shut down the government is the surest way to end conservatism as a practical political alternative.
The GOP has no leverage in budget negotiations, and conservative denial wonât change that.
Use Game Theory As I wrote on November 12, fighting Obama â voting down a budget in the House â results in the GOPâs worst possible outcome: total blame for anything that goes wrong and no credit for anything that goes right.</description>

      <description>Sometimes a causeâs worst enemies are its best friends.

In 1995, 56 percent of American described themselves as âpro-choice.âÂ At the time, Michael Kinsley on CNNâs Crossfire declared the debate over.
Then something strange happened. Americans started changing their minds.Â The pro-life movement whittled away at public opinion.
By May of this year, Gallup found âpro-choiceâ to be at an all-time low:
 The 41% of Americans who now identify themselves as &amp;ldquo;pro-choice&amp;rdquo; is down from 47% last July and is one percentage point below the previous record low in Gallup trends, recorded in May 2009.</description>

      <description>I wrote yesterday that if you need someone to blame, blame me. Donât blame bogeymen.

Yes, vote fraud is real. Voter rolls in most states need to be cleaned up. Voter intimidation should be harshly prosecuted.
You can sign up at True the Vote or Missouri Precinct Project to take effective, useful action. These organizations do vital work, and they both need more volunteers.
Using vote fraud, however, as an excuse for secession or for blocking the Electoral College vote is neither effective nor useful.</description>

Unions destroy themselves like pathetic drunks, dragging down everyone around them.

In a fine example of anti-strategic thinking and un-game theory, the Bakers Union put 637 of its members out of work yesterday.
Hostessâmakers of Twinkiesâis bankrupt. Part of the bankruptcy involved rewriting union contracts to allow the company to stay in business.
Instead of taking one for the team and helping their company crawl out of its fiscal hole, the Bakers went on strike.</description>

      <description>We heard it repeatedly during the Iraq wars: air power alone cannot win. You must take and hold ground in war.

The same is true in political combat. For years the GOP upset Democrats at all levels through superior ground games. Typically, this process involves:
 * Identifying potential voters * Contacting the high-value targets * Registering the unregistered * Mobilizing them on election day  Karl Roveâs Crossroads PACs tried a different strategy this time.</description>

 By the EPA&amp;rsquo;s own reckoning, the rule if implemented annually would cost American businesses $90 billion. But a related rule due to be taken up in December similarly would declare large swaths of the U.S. &amp;ldquo;closed for new business&amp;rdquo; until emissions are reduced to meet lower caps than exist today, says Anne Kolton, spokeswoman for the American Chemistry Council.</description>

  Here&amp;rsquo;s the scam. Only 42 votes have been counted in a country of 150 million registered voters. In other words, it&amp;rsquo;s crap. No responsible news organization would post such misleading nonsense&amp;ndash;except in hopes of discouraging Romney voters.</description>

      <description>Conservatives take great pride in working, and for good reason. Work gives shape to life. Work is the poles of a tent, the bones of a body, the beams in the ceiling.

But work isnât why we live. We live to pursue happiness.
For some, the pursuit of happiness involves acquiring property. Land, clothes, cars, plastic surgery. All examples of the pursuit of happiness.
Voting is another pursuit. People vote for minor candidates representing strange parties who have no chance of winning.</description>

      <description>Yes, Iâm feeling a wave toward Romney.

My gut tells me this year is a lot like 1980.
1980 Was A Dead Heat
The final Gallup poll that year had a dead heat. Time Magazineâs November 3, 1980, called the race a dead heat. So did Newsweek.
The press was hoping John B. Anderson, a former Republican Congressman running for president as an independent, would siphon votes from Reagan. He did siphon votes from Reagan, but not nearly enough.</description>

      <description>If you canât find full-time work, blame Obamacare.

One reason the Middle Class has shriveled and wages shrunk over the the past four years is underemployment. People want full time work, but settle for anything. And anything is usually part time.
Most of the fantastic new jobs created since the 2009 have been part-time jobs.
According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 14.6% of Americans want a full-time job but settle for part-time.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s What To Do Today And On Election Day
Tuesday is the most important election of your life, but voting is never enough. You can have a bigger impact by using social proof to increase your influence. I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you how, and it won&amp;rsquo;t take you long.
  First, though, make sure nothing gets in the way of exercising your duty to vote.
Studies have shown that you are more likely to vote if you answer these questions before Election Day:</description>

      <description>Barack Obama ridiculed George W. Bush for Katrina.

As people starve and beg for water in Rockaways, Obamaâs promises to create heaven on earth through government look foolish and born of ignorance.
Obama believes that government can solve any problem, large or small. But his FEMA canât get water to people in New York City.
With election two days away, remember this, you Obama voters: the most activist president of all time was unable to feed, clothe, and house hurricane victims despite having a week of warning.</description>

This is an email to encourage you to remember to do all you can to get Ed Martin elected Attorney General of Missouri. I know there are a lot of races and it is easy sometimes to overlook some of the down-ticket offices. But the Attorney General is an extremely important office. He is the chief law enforcement official of the state. He is responsible for seeing to it that our laws are faithfully enforced and our constitutional rights protected.</description>

      <description>Gallup released its early voting poll today, and it shows Mitt Romney winning 52% to 45%âright in line with their Likely Voter poll numbers. Hereâs the chart.

Politico Reporter Canât Read But Gallupâs section on early voting by party ID completely lost Politicoâs Kevin Robillard.
Robillard looked at the chart that shows when voters intend to vote by party and candidate and mistook it for voting results. This poll question shows that those who support Obama as as likely to vote early as are those who support Romney.</description>

      <description>The fog of war is lifting from Benghazi, and what lies beneath should shame Obamaâs most ardent supporters. Barack Obama choked, and Americans died.

When America came under attack, Obama panicked and froze.
When Americans under his direction pleaded for their lives, he was afraid to pull the trigger.
Hereâs the emerging picture.
White House Ordered Military and CIA to Stand Down and Let Al Qaeda Kill Former Navy SEALs Ty Woods and Glen Doherty, so disgusted by the White Houseâs refusal to help Americans under attack, defied an order to stand down.</description>

Maybe theyâve read about socialism, seen the movies, and heard about it from their college professorsâya know, like the one who actually visited the old Soviet Union.
But those sources give only an intellectual view of socialism. You canât actually _feel _it. And life, in the end, is about feelings.</description>

      <description>Polls do influence elections. Thatâs why people like Nate Silver and some of the writers at Business Insider are doing somersaults over Gallupâs Daily Presidential Tracking numbers.

For over a week, Gallup has shown a tidal wave for support for Mitt Romney. Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight tried to discredit Gallup by blogging about outlier results itâs shown in past years. Hereâs the conclusion Business Insider reached:
 Bottom line: Gallup swings wildly and it frequently has results not in line with other pollsters.</description>

Exhibit A: Obama hands Solyndra millions in tax dollars to promote green energy. Solyndra (and numerous other green energy grant recipients) goes bankrupt.
Another example is the St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners.
In 1861, Missouriâs legislature created a board of commissioners to oversee the St. Louis Police Department. Why? Because Missouri was a slave state, but St.</description>

Still, the commercial is a waste of time and money unless people see it.

      <description>Arguably, the most important battles for economic liberty in the nextÂ four years will be between states and the government in Washington. The progressives in Washington want to consolidate power and money to feed the insatiable appetite of parasites in the USA and the world.

Rex Sinquefield, the billionaire Bishop DuBourg alum who masquerades as a libertarian-ish Republican, lifted his mask this week to help Washingtonâs progressives steal Missouriâs autonomy and treasures.</description>

      <title>Barack Obama Is Having a Very Bad Week, and Even WaPo Noticed</title>

The smartest man in the world canât make a gaffe, surely. When Barack Obama says something ridiculous, mean-spirited, wrongheaded, or just plain dumb, he means it.
So we know Obama considers the murders of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others mere âbumps in the roadâ to his re-election. Four bumps, to be precise.
When Obama says Israel is just âone of our strongest alliesâ in the Middle East, no longer our strongest, he means it.</description>

      <description>A couple years ago, a lot of folks believed that victory in 2010 would be a cakewalk. Led by Tea Party activists, the GOP picked up over 800 legislative seats, state and federal, in the 2010 off-year election. Rumors of the Republican Party&amp;rsquo;s death had been greatly exaggerated.
  
Or so it seemed.
Novels and action movies involve a hero&amp;rsquo;s quest. The main character hopes to accomplish something. Dorothy wants to return to Kansas.</description>

      <description>A genius is someone who can hold contrary concepts simultaneously in mind.
What, then, do we call a person who simultaneously argues two contrary concepts?

How âbout âdemagogue?â
A few weeks ago, Barack Obama told Americaâs business owners that they are not responsible for their success.Â âSomeone else built that.â
Today, the same Obama told Mitt Romney that there not many people who consider themselves victims.
Does Mr. Obama believe that people in dire straights are not victims of circumstances?</description>

      <description>Barack Obama came to office promising to heal the planet (I didnât know it was sick), lower the waters, and end war as we knew it âwhilst waking on water squirting wine out his ass,â to borrow William S. Burroughsâs anti-Christian blasphemy in Naked Lunch. (Funny. I donât recall reading about Christians blowing up embassies over that bookâs publication.)

      <description>The Romney Campaign today reminded me of the McCain Campaign of 2008.
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty good at ignoring bogus, fraudulent polls like the one CNN released tonight. In that poll, CNN announced a massive 52-46 national lead for Obama. If true, the race would be all but over.
CNN, of course, cooked the books on this one.
About one-third of voters describe themselves as independents, CNN sampled only 3% independents for its latest poll.</description>

      <description>As if reading from a script written by the Romney campaign, the Democrats on Wednesday managed to mangle their public image even further, this time by booing God and Israel.

On Tuesday, the Democratic National Convention stripped God&amp;rsquo;s name from their platform and rejected Israel&amp;rsquo;s choice of Jerusalem as its capital.
Wednesday, the party panicked and rushed in an amendment to restore God and Jerusalem.</description>

      <description>For years voters have complained that politicians and parties say anything to get a vote. People have longed for the days of plain talk and honesty.
  Well, the Democrats passed a new platform today. Two headlines emerged:
  The Democrats rejected any reference to God.
  The Democrats rejected Jerusalem as Israel&amp;rsquo;s capital.
  The question is: can you trust them? Do Democrats really reject God and reject Jerusalem as the center of Israeli political life?</description>

&amp;ldquo;I could kill him,&amp;rdquo; is an idiom. Its cousins include &amp;ldquo;wring his neck&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;poke his eyes out.&amp;rdquo; Idioms hyperbolize our emotional reaction to an event.
I was angry because Todd Akin gave the left a great talking point in the infamous interview. I like Todd Akin. I voted for him.</description>

      <description>The story Isaac is about tests of faith.
God commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, his only son, born after Abraham and Sarah had given up hope of conceiving.
Once Isaac was bound and placed on the altar, God stayed Abraham&amp;rsquo;s hand. &amp;ldquo;Now I know you fear God.&amp;rdquo;
You know the rest.
It just struck me this morning, listening to the weather during Jamie Allman&amp;rsquo;s show, that Isaac now threatens the GOP convention, dangling above Tampa like Abraham&amp;rsquo;s dagger.</description>

Before we get too far down the Akin rally road, let&amp;rsquo;s get some solid advice to Mr. Akin.

What is Todd&amp;rsquo;s real crime?
He&amp;rsquo;s a damaged candidate, sure, but he is not a damaged man.
He was wrong, but** he erred on the side of life**.
It says something about a society and political mood where a man can be disqualified for loving life and God, but another man celebrated for enabling the slaughter of living children with surgical scissors through the base of their skulls.</description>

I think it&amp;rsquo;s smart to have a plan in case Todd Akin drops. The GOP central committee is working on a plan. If you wait until after a vacancy occurs, your preferences will be meaningless.
That said, if you should decide to plot a contingency to influence the selection of a candidate to fill a vacancy that might occur, consider this:Â **the MOGOP central committee is not tea-party-ish.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I blogged about loyalty to people and loyalty to principles. Both are important. Loyalty to people is an honorable principle.
Sometimes, the ideal is paramount. In 2012, we simply must take the US Senate. We must put Claire McCaskill out of office. And we must send a strong conservative to the US House of Representatives from Missouriâs 2nd Congressional district.
Missouriâs 2nd Congressional District has been well served by Todd Akin.</description>

Game theory is a branch of social science concerned with strategic decision-making. It is most closely associated with economics. Professor John Nash, the subject of the movie A Beautiful Mind, won a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in game theory. (For a great primer on the subject, read Thinking Strategically: the competitive advantage in business, politics, and everyday life.</description>

      <description>America is suffocating under an amazing tax burden, but most Americans STILL underestimate how much their tax bill really is.Â Thatâs because Washington has done a fantastic job of forcing employers to hide most of the taxes you pay.Â If people had to see and deal with their total liability, the Democratic Party would be swept into the dust bin of history.

      <description>Choosing Paul Ryan as his running mate was a great Romney move. Looking ahead, Romney sees movement conservatives working hard right up to the electionâeven if he or his advisors continues to say stupid things.Â That was necessary.

      <description>Why did murder skyrocket in Chicago as soon as Rahm Emanuel became mayor? Why have Americans become nastier and meaner since Barack Obama became president?

As Michael Dukakis told us, a fish rots from the head down. Obama surrounds himself with people who thrive on decay and death.
After four years, Obama has nothing to say for himself. Nothing. He can only cut and attack and lie and sneer and mock like a high school bully.</description>

To what and whom do we owe loyalty, and how should we express it?
Generational historians William Strauss and Neil Howe describe a generation of &amp;ldquo;nomads&amp;rdquo; in their prophetic book The Fourth Turning.
 &amp;ldquo;The 13th Generation (Nomad, born 1961-1981) survived a hurried childhood of divorce, latchkeys, open classrooms, devil-child movies, and a shift from G to R ratings. They came of age curtailing the earlier rise in youth crime and fall in test scoresâyet heard themselves denounced as so wild and stupid as to put The Nation at Risk.</description>

      <description>The horror in Aurora, Colorado, gave President Obama a little cover last Friday. That&amp;rsquo;s because the Labor Department announced that unemployment rose in 27 states.
President Obama promised to hold unemployment under eight percent if Congress passed the stimulus package in 2009. Congress did, but Obama failed. Remember all those green jobs? They&amp;rsquo;re gone.
**The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t Barack Obama; the problem is liberalism. **
Liberals believe that only experts can make intelligent decisions.</description>

      <description>According to research from Missouri Education Watchdog, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) agreed to surrender Missouri&amp;rsquo;s education voice under Obama&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Race to the Top&amp;rdquo; scheme. Race to the Top was a contest in which states agreed to let the federal Department of Education, via two puppet organizations, run all of the state&amp;rsquo;s education systems. In exchange, some states were awarded money, but others were not.
Chris Nicastro, chief rock in the DESE box, applied for the grant.</description>

      <description>Tax credits reward particular businesses or developers with tax dollars from the general population. They concentrate wealth in a few hands. Tax credits are the way politicians play the market with someone else&amp;rsquo;s money.
  
Worse, **Republicans are addicted to tax credits.Â **
A Missouri House Republican leader told a constituent that his party gives tax dollars to people who &amp;ldquo;spend it smarter.&amp;rdquo; Bill Clinton said the same thing in about 1992.</description>

      <description>Missouri&amp;rsquo;s primary is August 7. Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Republicans now litter the airwaves and in-boxes with smears against their Republican opponents. What strikes me is the weakness of so many of their pitches.
Every political ad is a pitch. It&amp;rsquo;s a chance to sell an idea and to volunteer as that idea&amp;rsquo;s champion in some high office. What a noble calling.
Few politicians take that noble path, sadly. Instead, they bully and vilify their opponents&amp;ndash;especially their primary opponents.</description>

      <description>Ronald Reagan loved to tell jokes about the Soviet Union.If Obamaâs re-elected, though, these same jokes could be turned on the United States.

Some of them already can be.
 It&amp;rsquo;s hard to get an automobile in the United States. They are owned mainly by elite bureaucrats. It takes an average of 10 years to get a car. 1 out of 7 families owned automobiles. You have to go through a major process and put the money out in advance.</description>

RCP aggregates dozens of polls to produce its RCP average. The method has been remarkably accurate, especially at the state level.
Itâs time to focus on preventing the unmitigated disaster of a second Obama term.
In 112 days, Americans will vote on whether or not to continue our experiment in self-government.Â If the election were held today, that experiment would be aborted.</description>

      <description>If you believe that 92 percent of people need to have most aspect of their lives managed by experts, then a second Obama term will make you happy.

If, however, you believe in self-governance, that people are endowed by God and nature with the capacity and unalienable right to manage their own affairs, then a second Obama term will be a massive human rights violation.
Consider what the Obama administration has already brought us:</description>

      <description>At the Pachyderm Clubâs national convention last year, I overheard a Republican Missouri State Representative talking about HB 609. âIt was the best bill Iâve ever been involved with,â she said. âThose people who just went nuts donât know anything about insurance.â

If you read my blog, youâre likely one of the âthose people,â the ignorant masses who donât understand the fineries of the legislative process. You donât appreciate how hard the insurance industry lobbyists worked with Jefferson City to craft a law that sold only a bit of you into slavery while ensuring the insurance companies remained profitable and your favorite Republican legislators had the money to campaign next year.</description>

      <description>Sometimes the folks at Business Insider get fairly simple ideas ass backwards.Â Take their Winners and Losers story on the Supreme Courtâs Obamacare decision. Itâs dead wrong about Millennials (born after 1982):
 Young people can also count themselves winners in the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act, which allows children to stay on their parents&amp;rsquo; insurance plan until their 26th birthday.

It was also a sign of the times.Â After a ten-year hiatus, patriotism was chic again, thanks to Ronald Reagan.Â Hereâs a few other things that made me fall in love with Independence Day:

Like now.

For years, Congress has used the tax code to motivate behavior.Â Tax credits for insulated windows and electric cars are examples.Â The home mortgage deduction is another. And tuition tax credits, dependent tax credits, etc.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I gave you a reason to celebrate the Supreme Courtâs decision.Â But I never said to let go of your anger or depression. ** Thatâs because we need creativity, focus, and action, and you get those through emotional distress. **

In his new best-selling book, Jonah Lehrer discusses the link between depression and creativity:
 This helps explain why Forgas has found that states of sadnessâ he induces the downcast mood with a film about death and cancerâ also correlate with better writing samples; subjects compose sentences that are clearer and more compelling.</description>

      <description>In the Ronald Reagan movie Kings Row, Reagan plays Drake McHugh, whose legs are sawn off by a sadistic, class-conscious doctor.

Everyone remembers the line âWhereâs the rest of me?â No remembers what happens after that. Iâll fill you in.
McHughâs best friend, a psychiatrist, decides to tell McHugh (Reagan) the truth: his legs were perfectly healthy, but the doctor cut them off to keep the lower class McHugh from pursuing the doctorâs debutante daughter.</description>

      <description>I love some things about Business Insider.Â Mostly its great headlines.
Unfortunately, sometimes its writers show an ignorance of basic economics in their rush to catapult Obama to a second term.Â Joe Weisenthal is just the latest example.
Joe tries to claim that economic recovery in the US is retarded by loss of public sector jobs.

What Joe doesnât seem to get is this:Â the private sector pays for those public sector jobs.</description>

      <description>In a column intended to attract readers, not to promote hard economics, Rotman University economist Richard Florida declares that home ownership is terrible for the US Economy.

The problem is, like many economists,** Floridaâs understanding of home ownership is 180 degrees ass-backwards**.Â Florida thinks that home ownership is supposed to _cause_ economic growth.
 Instead of leading to economic development, higher rates of homeownership today are associated with lower levels of it.</description>

It took my doctor 10 minutes to describe my symptoms into a government-mandated voice recognition system.   
In the old days, the doctor took notes. Now, he has to recite his observations into a Mad Men-era dictaphone. &amp;ldquo;Male, age 48, blood pressure one-twenty-one over seventy-three . . . &amp;quot;

We heard that the enormous Millennial Generation, born between 1982 and 2001, would destroy the GOP and everything America once stood for&amp;ndash;like jobs, family, faith, and hard work. And when Obama won, many believed the tales of the Obama Youth.
  
But many were wrong. Voters under 30 have had it with vague promises and glittering bullshit from that punk from Chicago.</description>

How else to explain his emotional outburst on Business Insider? Why else would he jump to the conclusion that our bankrupt federal government understands finances better than billionaires?
Hereâs Blodget:
 Wall Street can&amp;rsquo;t be trusted to manageâor even correctly assessâits own risks.
This is in part because, time and again, Wall Street has demonstrated that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even KNOW what risks it is taking.</description>

      <description>Analogies say more about the speaker than about the subject.
Candy Crowley told KMOX Radio listeners on Friday that Tea Party groups resemble the Balkans without guns.
Wrong. Crappy analogy, Candy. The diverse and autonomous, often quarrelsome,** Tea Party groups remind me of the original 13 colonies.**
The colonies were divided on just about every subject imaginable. The disagreed on slavery, on economics, on agraculture, manufacturing, cities, names &amp;ndash; name it.</description>

      <description>Cambridge, MAâMassachusetts Democratic Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren donned a pink headdress and performed, what she called, an âauthentic Indian rain danceâ during a press conference today.Â Ms Warren was hoping to convince skeptics of her claims of Native American heritage. She also hinted that her preference for bison meat to beef indicates her heritage.
âMy pepaw taught me this dance when I was a little girl,â Warren said during a short session with reporters at a high school gymnasium in Cambridge, MA.</description>

      <description>Missouri House Speaker Steve Tilley and Senate Leader Kevin Engler never tire of implementing Obamaâs totalitarian agenda.

This time, Tilley and Engler are shoving HB 1193 through to passage. This bill is designed to score brownie points with Sibelius and Obama by creating a prescription spy network that monitors the prescription drug purchases of every Missouri resident.
If Tilley and Engler get their way, every time your doctor writes a prescription, your pharmacist will be required to inform Jefferson City and Washington bureaucrats.</description>

      <description>The new fad among Democrats is to see how many illegal aliens they can pack into a voting booth. While we conservatives decry this illegal and anti-American grab at tyrannical power, we should take some solace in this sobering fact: those illegal aliens probably know as much about the American political system as most 13th generation Americans.
  
The fact is, most Americans are too stupid about politics to vote, which explains the 2008 election.</description>

Some of the stories involve Bain laying off workers to make companies profitable, then selling them off.
Some of the stories involve Bain and Romney chopping companies to bits and selling off the parts.

 Many critics view The Times as constitutionally unable to address the election in an unbiased fashion. Like a lot of America, it basked a bit in the warm glow of Mr. Obamaâs election in 2008. The company published a book about the countryâs first African-American president,Â âObama: The Historic Journey.âÂ The Times also publishedÂ a lengthy portrait of himÂ in its Times Topics section onÂ NYTimes.</description>

      <description>John McCain knew that Obama&amp;rsquo;s minions orchestrated massive voter fraud in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Besides using New Black Panther Party soldiers to repel McCain voters from the polls,** Democrats stuff ballot boxes to give Obama the win in two states with a combined 41 electoral votes**.

Here&amp;rsquo;s how a memo leaked by wikileaks summarized McCain&amp;rsquo;s election night decision:
 After discussions with his inner circle, which explains the delay in his speech, McCain decided not to pursue the voter fraud in PA and Ohio, despite his staff&amp;rsquo;s desire to make it an issue.</description>

 Basically, with no changes to current law, taxes will rise for everyone, and after tax, inflation-adjusted income for the average American will drop to 1998 levels.

      <description>Let me get this straight. Secret Service Agents and some military guys brought more than 20 &amp;ndash; count &amp;lsquo;em, _twenty _&amp;ndash; hookers to a hotel in Cartagena, Columbia. The Americans were drinking&amp;ndash;a lot, according to hotel staff. When the girls were ready to leave, apparently, the Americans refused to pay.
I guess these soldier or sailors or Marines don&amp;rsquo;t watch enough movies. They&amp;rsquo;d know how hookers act when they don&amp;rsquo;t get paid.</description>

      <description>When Obama decreed that Catholics shall support and provide chemical abortions,he wasn&amp;rsquo;t promoting women. He was shackling religion.
Totalitarian autocrats don&amp;rsquo;t cotton freedom, unless they personally granted it. Obama doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in individual liberty, but that all power and rightsÂ emanateÂ from government. Timothy Cardinal Dolan agrees.
So it&amp;rsquo;s exciting to report that some St. Louisans are fighting back. Here&amp;rsquo;s the details:

 We may hear of the Tea Party here and there in the future, but I doubt it will ever figure prominently in American politics again.Â I say we should take a moment and reflect on what it might have been as we say farewell to the once promising Tea Party movement.</description>

The subject is the corrupt and corrupting judge selection process in Missouri, and how you can help change it. I learned a lot about the subject when Ed Martin pointed out this National Review article on the subject.
 The structure and left-wing dominance of the nominating commission (the distinctive feature of the Missouri Plan) has led many to argue that the state should amend the constitution to either directly elect judges or have them selected under something mirroring the advice/consent model set forth in the U.</description>

The two allegedly made contributions to the Democrat Party (legal), and reimbursed themselves out of Missouri Employers Mutual Insurance Companyâs coffers (illegal).
But thatâs not the weird part.Â After all, election fraud is the Democratsâ principal form of amusement.
The weird part is the statement from Griesedieckâs law firm.</description>

      <description>November 7, 2012âWhen the AP called Florida for Obama only twenty minutes after polls closed there (8:00 EDT), any hopes of a Republican presidential victory were dashed.

And before polls closed in the West, we knew that the GOP had lost the House as well as seven state legislatures.
In short, the Grand Old Party died last night.
Hereâs what went wrong.

      <description>Of course you do.
Itâs at 7:00 at the Crowne Plaza in Clayton. The Crowne Plaza Grille, to be precise. April 19.
Itâs the April After Party, and the topic is the Missouri plan.
Your mission: bring one friend whoâs never been to a Tea Party event.
If you canât find someone to bring, come anyway.
Thinking about skipping? Donât.
The most important election since Lincolnâs first is just seven months away.</description>

      <title>Obama, Obamacare and the Supreme Court</title>

      <description>First, my prediction:
 Is Obamacare a tax? (8-1 Against)  Technically speaking, if Obamacare is a tax, it could be non-justiciable until implementation. However, judicial precedence suggests the courts may review a tax before its implementation in certain circumstances. The Government did not even want to argue that Obamacare was a tax, so the Supreme Court (SCOTUS) appointed a separate attorney to make the argument. The only SCOTUS justice that appeared to entertain this line was Justice Breyer.</description>

      <description>From Mark Steyn:
 Justice Ginsburg swung by Cairo last month to help out the lads from the Muslim Brotherhood building the new Egypt: âI would not look to the   United States Constitution if I were drafting a constitution in the year 2012,â she advised them.
 That a sitting Supreme Court justice would denigrate the Constitution she&amp;rsquo;s sworn to uphold in a foreign country deserves the sort of scorn normally reserved for traitors.</description>

      <description>We wonât know the result until late June, most likely. And the results of todayâs vote could change by then.

Still, itâs sort of weird that after three years of public, wildly emotional and stupifyingly complex arguments, the fate of the republic comes down to a short meeting in Washington involving nine people in a paneled room.
Mark Sherman of AP describes the cloistered scene:
 After months of anticipation, thousands of pages of briefs and more than six hours of arguments, the justices will vote on the fate of President Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s health care overhaul in under an hour Friday morning.</description>

      <description>The term âUnited Statesâ is both plural (many states united) and singular (the United States). The tag line âe pluribus unumâ loses its meaning if we cease to be many, if we give up our identities as individual states. As states, we are as different from each other as the United States is from Canada.
The United States are most powerful pursuing opportunities and fixing problems in the plural but defending in the singular.</description>

      <description>When the Supreme Court releases its opinion on the ObamaCare case, America will change fundamentally. This is the most important case to the future of the republic since the Great Depression or the Civil War.
 If the court upholds ObamaCare, it will end the principle of government limited by a written Constitution. Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia said as much. A vote by Kennedy to uphold the legislation, then, would be a vote for unlimited government power.</description>

John Knowlesâs classic novel, A Separate Peace, begins memorably:
 I went back to the Devon School not long ago, and found it looking oddly newer than when I was a student there fifteen years before . . . as if a coat of varnish had been put over everything for better preservation.
 I get precisely the opposite feel when I look at the Republican Party.</description>

      <description>When the Supreme Court rules on ObamaCare, it will define Barack Obama as either a winner or loser.

James Carville says overturning ObamaCare would be the best thing that could happen to Democrats. I think heâs wrong.
ObamaCare is the centerpiece of Obamaâs term in office. He put all of Americaâs business on hold for a year to pass it. He coerced, lied, intimidated, and threatened to get the law passed.</description>

      <description>Everyone (including me) is cracking on Donald Verrilli, Obamaâs Solicitor General. He figuratively died on the biggest legal stage in the world today. Hereâs a sample of the leftâs reaction to Verrilliâs performance:
Mother Jones:
 Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. should be grateful to the Supreme Court for refusing to allow cameras in the courtroom, because his defense of Obamacare on Tuesday may go down as one of the most spectacular flameouts in the history of the court.</description>

      <description>Iâm often amazed at the weakness of arguments before the Supreme Court. Today, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, attempting to help out the Obama Administrationâs fumbling solicitor-general, made the weakest argument Iâve ever heard.
First,Ginsburg statement:
 Mr. Verrilli, I thought that your main point is that, unlike food or any otherÂ market, when you made the choice not to buy insurance, even though you have every intent in the world to self-insure, to save for it, when disaster strikes, you may not have the money.</description>

The St. Louis Cardinals owe big government statism and technological innovation a big thanks, in addition to geography and great teams. The technology was radio. The big government statist?</description>

Actually, Rodgerâs not so much like the rest of us. Rodger has served the people of Illinois all of his adult life. Rodger has been a police officer, a detective, a mayor, and private businessman.</description>

Jason Plummer, a 29-year-old lumber heir, is the GOP Establishmentâs appointed candidate for US Congress in Illinoisâ 12th Congressional District. Heâs facing a shockingly tough race from former police detective and former Belleville Mayor, Rodger Cook. (Never underestimate a detectiveâs tenacity.)
In a debate last week, Plummer failed his one simple assignment. Despite a nearly unlimited war chest from his familyâs fortune and the Illinois GOP treasury, Plummer said something stupid.</description>

      <description>Jennifer Pahlka is a remarkable woman. She realized what many have realized: government often fails at its most basic tasks.
Governments don&amp;rsquo;t keep up with technology or culture. Nor can they act nimbly. A start-up produces finished products worth millions in four months; it takes government that long to start the first feasibility study.
Spotting government&amp;rsquo;s shortcomings isn&amp;rsquo;t what makes Jennifer so amazing. Every sane American knows that government is a nightmare of bureaucratic hell that admires problems and punishes the successful.</description>

      <description>Is the US economy about to collapse worse the Greeceâs?
Some, like Paul Krugman, say that itâs okay for governments to print unlimited money. Others, who have actually managed businesses, say otherwise.
**David Stockman is among the latter. He was Reaganâs budget director for a few years. He became a media sensation because of his command of numbers. **
He left the White House early, fretting over federal debt. But debt in the 1980s was as a piggy bank to Wells Fargo.</description>

      <description>What made Rush Limbaugh so amazing for 24 years was his steadfast resolve.Â Face it, you have to believe what you believe title your books The Way Things Ought To Be and See, I Told You So.
His fans loved him because he never backed down.
Rush didnât back down when the left went nuts over his âObama, The Magic Negroâ parody. He didnât back down from his âhope Obama failsâ statement.</description>

      <description>A Georgetown law student turned the Democrat Party from an androgynous blob into a modern day Ivanhoe. (Yes, Iâll tread carefully around that âIvanhoeâ to spare Democrat sensibilities.)

Sandra Fluke, the student, begged Congress to confiscate property from me and millions of other taxpayers in order to satisfy her sexual appetite.
Rush Limbaugh pointed out that law school lasts three years, condoms cost about a buck each, and Ms. Fluke needed 3,000 of them just to make it to the bar exam.</description>

      <title>RIP, Andrew Breitbart **UPDATE**</title>

      <description>Business Insider has picked up a Big Journalism story that Andrew Breitbart died last night.Â (Big Journalism is one of Breitbartâs web sites.)
If this is true, then weâve lost a gallant warrior in the battle to preserve and advance freedom and liberty.
Of course, the lefties will flood the internet with hate and bile.Â So maybe the obit is a plot to draw the lefties out and reveal them for who and what they really are.</description>

      <description>Looks different, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?
After hosting my own web sites forever, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to simplify my server admin life. I&amp;rsquo;m moving Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View to another service from my own servers.
The difference you should see is the theme. (I&amp;rsquo;m tired of the minimalism.) Also, some archives from before 2010 might be missing for a while. They&amp;rsquo;ll catch up soon enough.
Thanks

      <description>Yesterday, I blogged about freedom envyâthe feeling Americans get when they look at countries where the people get freer every day.
Today, thanks to Economic Freedom blog, we have a great video to introduce the idea of economic freedom.
Does that sound silly? I mean, arenât Americans born with an understanding of economic freedom? And craving to preserve it?
Yes, we are.
But our schools, entertainment, press, and, above all, GOVERNMENT beats economic freedom out of us by the time weâre 14 years old.</description>

      <description>The first entry in National Reviewâs âThe Weekâ from sometime around 1990 listed ten or so former Soviet bloc countries that recently had shed the yoke of communist repression. And it made a simple statement:
 âIt must be nice to live in a country where you get freer every day.â

      <description>The 3rd Anniversary Tea Party rocked . . . because of the great patriot-activists who have decided itâs time to act and win.

Although Dr. Larry Schweikart couldnât make it (because of the Chicago snow storm), Fridayâs event was better than planned or expected.Â Tea Party champion Michael Patrick Leahy jumped into fill a last-minute void, and the crowd loved it.
  I had the the pleasure of reading and advanced copy of Mike Leahy&amp;rsquo;s new book, Covenant of Liberty: The Ideological Origins of the Tea Party Movement  in December.</description>

      <description>Just because itâs after 10:00 am, doesnât mean you canât come to the 3rd Anniversary Tea Party.
No, we didnât come up with a policy for people who arrive late to the feast. We will find a way to get you involved thatâs fair to everyone.
Grab your laptop or your mobile device, if you have one, get in your car, and drive to the Crowne Plaza in Clayton.Â Ask for the Tea Party.</description>

      <description>Yes, Iâve written about little else. The 3rd Anniversary Tea Party is something of an obsession with me. And for good reasons: * Obama is surging * Apathy has seized the right * Americaâs future hangs in the balance
But thereâs a much bigger reason youâyou, the person reading this blogâshould attend the 3rd Anniversary Tea Party.
That reason is personal, powerful, and acute.
That reason is this:You cannot live with yourself if Obama wins and you failed to do everything in your power to stop him.</description>

      <description>Today begins Lent.

Lent prepares us for the cycle of mortality and resurrection, perfected by Christ, without which life has no meaning. Itâs a time of humility. We call to mind our human brokenness in hopes of making ourselves better imitators of Christ.
On Ash Wednesday, we mark ourselves with the sign of the cross in ashes. **âRemember, man, that you are dust and unto dust you shall return (Genesis 3:19).</description>

      <description>I see is all the time. Supporters of Establishment candidates complain that their opponents are establishment, too.
We saw it in the Missouri 2nd District.Â We see in the GOP Presidential primary.Â The last refuge of the Establishmentâs candidates is to spread the pain of the Establishment label.
What many people donât get is what the Establishment label actually means.Â Itâs time everyone understood this.
**The Establishmentâs candidate is the candidate the Establishment chooses for us.</description>

In this post on Obamaâs continuing jihad against Christianity, he answers a burning question: did human happiness exist before artificial contraception?
Put another way, is chemical birth control a natural state of humanity?

Today is Washingtonâs Birthday. As a posthumous birthday gift to our first president and commander-in-chief of the army that won our war for independence, I offer a simple wish: that the army of liberty formed in February 2009, known as âthe Tea Party,â will resist the temptation to resign.
Thatâs a great word for what a lot of us feel these days: resignation.</description>

      <description>Donât bother blaming it on poll questions designed to lead respondents.Â Never mind that itâs a long way until the election. And stop whining about the White House fudging the numbers on unemployment.
The fact is that Obamaâs surging at just the right time. His re-election chances are now above 50 percent. His intrade.com chances of winning are near 60 percent. And heâs raising more money than al of the Republican candidates combined.</description>

      <description>Do you know the most persecuted religious group on earth?
History speaks of the massive Roman persecution of Christians. The catacombs of Rome, housing the remains of thousands of Christian martyrs, tell us the story and give voice to the dead.
But the Romans had nothing on we moderns when it comes to persecuting Christians. Today, Christians are the most persecuted religious group on the planet. And the problem grows worse every day.</description>

      <description>When Barack Obama declared that Catholics must either violate their consciences or face government persecution, he wasnât going after just Catholics. Nor was he promoting healthcare.
Barack Obama and his myrmidon Kathleen Sebelius tried to erase the First Amendment. They tried to erase religious freedom. They tried to take away yet another foundational liberty that made America America.
And they will try again  &#34;
Unless you stop them.

**Santorum is most appealing to conservativesâfrom Evangelicals to Tea Partiers: **
 Santorum is now completely dominating with several key segments of the electorate, especially the most right leaning parts of the party. With those describing themselves as &amp;lsquo;very conservative,&amp;rsquo; he&amp;rsquo;s now winning a majority of voters at 53% to 20% for Gingrich and 15% for Romney. Santorum gets a majority with Tea Party voters as well at 51% to 24% for Gingrich and 12% for Romney.</description>

Relate to this: if Mitt Romneyâs a conservative, Iâm a Hottentot.

By ârelate to,â the media and Romneyâs handlers actually mean âhoodwink.â While Romney might secure the GOP nomination without conservative support, his campaign will go down in flames without conservative grassroots boots on the ground from Labor Day to Election Day.</description>

The prospect of a Republican beating Obama isn&amp;rsquo;t frightening, of courseâany of the four remaining candidates would be night and day better for our future.Â Whatâs frightening is that so many people bet on the unknowable.
Except in rare casesâone candidate is caught stealing from a church weeks before the electionâpolitical elections carry too many variables for anyone to predict their results a month in advance, much less three-quarters of a year ahead.</description>

      <description>Ask a real partisanâsomeone with a Ron Paul or Ed Martin sticker on his car&amp;ndash;why he supports that candidate. Youâll get a lot of rational reasons.
Then challenge just one of those reasons, and what do you get? More reason?
No, you get raw emotions.

Thatâs because the emotional mindâthe part of the brain designed for survivalâexerts far more influence over our thinking that most people are willing to admit.</description>

      <description>At some point, each additional GOP Presidential debate becomes just a bigger pain in the . . . But science shows us that the last debate before a voteâand the last memorable event in the last debateâis paramount to how we remember the entire event.
In fact, memorable moments at the end, not consistent performance throughout, determine who wins and who loses.
In this awesome TED talk, Nobel winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains the weird difference between our experiencing selves and our remembering selves.</description>

      <description>While everyone was screaming about the rising cost of medical treatment, Americaâs leftist incubation chambersâcolleges and universitiesârobbed us of our economic future. And the federal governmentâs misguided student aid program is to blame.
**What allows this growth? ** * Increased per student government funding * Massive private and public debt
Who benefits? * College administrators * Unions working on college campuses * Political causes that college administrators like (liberal)

      <description>Two weeks ago, weeks ago, how many Missouri statewide offices did you expect to flip? Be honest.
Yes, there are great people running for Governor, Secretary of State, and Treasurer.Â And we already have a fine Lieutenant Governor Kinder running for re-election.
But numerous factors, like name recognition, experience, and Jay Nixonâs weird relationship with Republican House leadership, made a major upset unlikely. And no Republicans had stepped up to challenge Chris Koster for Attorney General.</description>

      <description>Ed Martin Jr. of St. Louis has redirected his fire to the Attorney General race, and this is great news for everyone except Chris Koster.
Back when Ed Martin was talking about running for the Republican nod to take on Claire McCaskill, I had another thought. Well, a bunch of people had another thought: Ed would make an outstanding Attorney General.
UPDATE
HUGE list of endorsements on Edâs official press release.</description>

In this interview with Russ Roberts, Dr. Rose discusses his new book Moral Foundations of Economic Behavior.
This is great stuff for everyone, especially economic liberty fiends like me.

      <description>Truth is, not all companies, not all business ideas, can make it on their own.
Itâs easy to say that a good idea will automatically lead to a successful business. But itâs a lie.
Apple did not become Apple without investors. Sure, there are some examples of businesses that flourished without financial help. But not many. Weâll never know the wonderful ideas that died in their ownerâs garage for lack of financing.</description>

      <description>Most Americans know more about forensic evidence in the Casey Anthony case than they do about the Constitution.Â That ignorance gave Barack Obama the hubris to end constitutional government in the United States. He did it, and you probably didnât even notice.
Over the course of a week, Barack Obama made a series of so-called recess appointments. In the process, he and his henchmen in Eric Holderâs Justice Department effectively nullified the US Constitution.</description>

      <description>Okay, Santorum and Gingrich didnât get a bump out of their debates over the weekend. More like the bump got them.
And Ron Paul did way better than I expected. Congratulations to Dr. Paul and Mitt. 
I still think my Saturday night post accurately reflected the national impressions, though. Thatâs backed up by this CBS News poll that shows Republicans believe Santorum most closely shares their values, butâand this is a J Lo butâthey believe Romney is more electable.</description>

Last week, I told you about my maniacal focus for 2012. At the beginning of the week, I stuck carefully to my plan. But after two consecutive 15-hour days at work, I let my mind wander a little. Iâm sure you know how that goes.
Well, Sunday is a great touchstone. And who provided my guidance and support? A 16th century saint and Doctor of the Church.</description>

      <description>It depends on how you score. 
I see three scoring scenarios: 1. Best conservative performance 2. Best electability performance 3. Best positional performance
Conservative performance is pretty clear: whose answers appeal to conservatives? (Does not mean conservatives believed the candidate meant what he said.) This is not Tea Party scoring, either. Iâm not limiting my evaluation to the 3 core Tea Party principles of Constitutionally limited government, free markets, and fiscal responsibility.</description>

      <description>Thatâs with 88 percent of the counting complete.
The bigger story: Romneyâs underperforming his 2008 results in key counties. Santorum outperforming Huckabee in 2008.

What does it all mean?
Conservatives and libertarians dominate the caucuses.
Romney is the choice of the Republican establishment. The cronies poured millions into his campaign even before he declared himself a conservative. Heâs won endorsements from just about every big name general election loser include Bob Dole and George H.</description>

      <description>Until the clock struck twelve on January 1, that is.
Thatâs when 40,000 â count âem, forty thousandânew laws took effect in the United States.
Some of the new laws are, no doubt, good and proper. Some restore liberties lost. But others bind. And some are silly.
Utahâs banning happy hours. (Why not ban melancholy hours instead?) California now prohibits people 18 and under from using tanning beds. Georgia requires golf carts to have turn signals and horns if driven on public roads.</description>

      <description>Iâm almost finished reading Walter Isaacsonâs biography of Apple co-founder and genius Steve Jobs.
Jobsâs life left insanely good lessons. Some lessons instruct us on how to do things. Others warn us of bad things to avoid.
One of the good things Steve Jobs taught us:Â focus.Â Maniacal focus on things that mattered, and a pathological aversion to distractions.
One example.Â When Jobs returned to Apple after 10-year exile, he took stock of all the projects underway.</description>

February

      <description>Some St. Louis area conservatives cheered Roy Bluntâs (R-MO) elevation to the Number 5 leadership position in the Senate Republican caucus.

I didnât. At least not politically. I like Senator Blunt personally, so Iâm happy in that respect. But Iâm not happy for the reasons some others are.
First, as I told Jo Mannies of the St. Louis Beacon, internal party stuff isnât really a Tea Party matter. Leadership in the Senateâs GOP caucus is for Republican Senators to worry about.</description>

      <description>Everyone knows and accepts that government does stupid things. Sometimes it feels like people institute governments and delegate them certain powers just to give us something to complain about.
Government stupidity, scandal, and corruption hits different people in different ways. Government hyperactivity keeps poor people poor by limiting opportunity and by building barriers to exiting poverty programs. âIf you take that job, youâll lose your health insurance.â Compassion my non-qualifying asset.</description>

      <description>_This is the fourth in a series. If you havenât, please read part 1, part 2, and part 3.Â _
Because so many school systems have driven great English literature out of studentsâ hands and minds, itâs possible that some kids never read Charles Dickensâs A Christmas Carol.Â If youâve never read this classic, please do so now.Â You need it.

      <description>Scroogeâs nephew left the office and let in two men in the process. They came to ask for a donation for Londonâs poor.
 &amp;ldquo;At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,&amp;rdquo; said the gentleman, taking up a pen, &amp;ldquo;it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time.

      <description>We know how the story ends.
 &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s to-day!&amp;rdquo; cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.
&amp;ldquo;EH?&amp;rdquo; returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s to-day, my fine fellow?&amp;rdquo; said Scrooge.
&amp;ldquo;To-day!&amp;rdquo; replied the boy. &amp;ldquo;Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Christmas Day!&amp;rdquo; said Scrooge to himself. &amp;ldquo;I haven&amp;rsquo;t missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night.</description>

      <description>In the course of our lives, we sometimes lose our way. We wander off the good path. Or we fail to blaze the trail we should.

 THE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.
It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand.</description>

      <description>I live in a very hilly area. Yet Iâm still alive. Explain that.
Maybe thatâs why Iâm a lower-case ârâ republican and not an upper-case one.
Republicans seem to feel every hill is worth dying on.
What else could explain the Houseâs rejection of a silly payroll tax cut extension followed by a doubly-damaging capitulation?
By âsilly,â I mean ill-advised, inconsequential, irrational, and fiscally irresponsible. The Senateâs two-month extension of the Social Security tax cut represents the worst of Washington.</description>

To give some background, I grew up in a Catholic home. Very Catholic. My dad went to Epiphany. My momâs Catholic, and her dad converted very late in life. Two of my dadâs cousins were Monsignors.</description>

      <title>The Two Key Roles in Social Media Activism *Update*</title>

      <description>Have you ever studied human networks?
Iâm not talking about online social networks alone, but any kind of human network.
Theyâre amazing.

Networks tend to determine who we date, who we marry, and where we work. Our lives are more influenced by networks than we can imagine.
 A network community can be defined as a group of people who are much more connected to one another than they are to other groups of connected people found in other parts of the network.</description>

      <description>The middle of the road is fine until you have to get somewhere.
I voted for Bob Dole in 1996. Yet his nomination drove me away from political activism for years.

I got out of the Navy in the fall of 1994. I watched the GOP reclaim the House with my nephew, Scott.Â I expected the Republicans to nominate a solid conservative who deliver a knock-out blow to the Clinton era two years later.</description>

      <description>A college student asked me a question: Why join the Tea Party?

He was wondering why anyone would want to associate with people who behaved reprehensibly at two earlier Republican debates.
Hereâs how I replied:
 Johnny,
 Sorry that I&amp;rsquo;m just getting to this. I get a lot of email, and sometimes I miss things.
I organized the tea party in St. Louis in 2009. I did so because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that governments accumulate power until they crush liberty and freedom.</description>

      <description>Have you ever thought, âI need to do more for others?â
I have. And Iâve made feeble attempts to satisfy that urge. Feeble.
Still, when Iâve done something âgoodâ for others with no expectation of return, I kind of thump my chest and smile at myself in the mirror like Iâm some kind of big shot.
Then my wife introduced me to Valerie Hays, and I realized how much more a person can do.</description>

 Just a quick note that Yahoo has apparently changed their &amp;ldquo;Spam&amp;rdquo; firewall rules. You&amp;rsquo;re Tea Party updates have been showing up in my spam box for the past couple days. I can&amp;rsquo;t prove there is a conspiracy, but all of my e-mails from conservative organizations are showing up as spam while a lot of other crap is flying right through. Yahoo mail&amp;rsquo;s spam filter is supposed to be an adaptive process.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine told me this story.
 He sat that there bragging about getting a tax cut for friends of his.
I said, âyou do realize, donât you, that youâre just like the Democrats, except youâre giving taxpayers money to a different special interest.â
He looked at me and said, âbut our special interests do good with the money.â

      <description>The Washington Postâs headline writer made a common mistake on Sunday.

He confused âone who apologizesâ with âapologist.â
An easy mistake, no doubt, for most of us. Professional headline writers should know better. So should Glenn Kessler, the author of the WP story.
 The claim that Obama is an apologist for the nation began to take shape shortly after he became president.
 An apologist is âone who speaks or writes in defense of someone or something.</description>

      <description>Gloria in excelsis Deo. Et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis.
 The English version of the Roman Catholic Missal changed at the start of Advent. The new translation is truer to the Latin original.

The response to âThe Lord be with you,â change to âAnd with your spiritâ from âand also with you.â The Latin, et cum spiritu tuo translates exactly into âand with your spirit.â
Another change that thrills conservative Catholics, is the consecration.</description>

      <description>Tuesday in Kansas, President Barack Obama revealed his contempt for liberty. He declared that human beings are incapable of running their own lives . . . but, somehow, other, superior human beings are capable of running their own and othersâ.
  He said that free markets have always failed, everywhere . . . ignoring most of the last 240 years.
He all but declared himself a Marxist.
I am depressed that America let this dangerous man into our government.</description>

      <description>Yes, the establishment wants you to go away.
Are you going to obey?

With a little help from The Atlantic and New York Times (of all places), we can put together a strategy to recognize and deflect the establishmentâs tactics.
Put this in your back pocket. Youâll need it before primary season is over.
Establishment Tactic 1: Never admit membership in the establishment

      <description>Sometimes the right path is the easy path.
Then the alarm goes off, and we get up to face the world.
When we first met in February 2009, we set ourselves on a course. We dedicated ourselves to, in Buckleyâs words, stand athwart history, yelling âSTOP!â
But we promised ourselves and the world even more. We committed to reversing the neglect and abuse thatâs stained our liberty for more than half a century.</description>

      <description>A few years ago, Malcolm Gladwell wrote an awesome article for The New Yorker:Â How David Beats Goliath.Â Read it after you read this.
The story encourages and frustrates at the same time.
Encourages because we learn Davids can, occasionally, beat Goliaths.Â Frustrates because Goliaths tend to change the rules just before the epic battle.

Thatâs how the establishment winsâby establishing the rules. And changing them as necessary. Not exactly fair,Â but fairness isnât in the rule book.</description>

      <description>The Gipper didnât always follow his own commandment.
Iâve appreciated Newt Gingrichâs attitude during the 398 Republican Presidential debates. You know, his approach of refusing to attack his opponents.
He will, necessarily, change that approach a bit on the stump, but itâs been very effective so far. As Gingrich might put it, anyone on this stage will do a better job than Barack Obama.
And heâd be right.
But being right about that doesnât mean candidates donât have an obligation to show voters why theyâre preferable to their opponents.</description>

      <description>Some center-right people take their ball and go home. Guess who?

Since the 2010 election, weâve heard from the Establishment (GOP, MSM, DNC) that Tea Partiers are too puritanical.
The elitist theory holds that Tea Partiers demand doctrinaire allegiance to some engraved-granite list of principles. Stray from that list, and the Tea Party will hunt you down like a dog in the street and beat you with a Wiffle Ball bat until you pee blood for a week.</description>

  They&amp;rsquo;re frustrated because they hear about our events afterÂ the events.
That&amp;rsquo;s no good. We want people at the events. That&amp;rsquo;s what makes them events.
**What you asked for was some way to get a phone call about upcoming events. **
That&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable. The question is, how are we going to pay for it?</description>

      <description>The quality of the answers you get in life depend on the quality of the questions you ask.
  
Sometimes, though, when offered the chance to ask important questions, we ask questions about personal gain or immediate problems. That&amp;rsquo;s natural. Our brains are wired to prompt us with the urgent, immediate things in our lives.
But sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s not the best strategy. Sometimes we need answers to the bigger questions&amp;ndash;questions that may be crucial later.</description>

      <description>Like the Penn State athletic department, most St. Louis news media covered up a sex crime in order to protect an organization they love.
The St. Louis Post Dispatch, KTVI 2 and KPLR 11, and KSDK 5 each failed to report a sexual assault that took place at the illegal OccupySTL squatters&amp;rsquo; village in Kiener Plaza last week.
The assault came to light only because a citizen-journalist, the POed Patriot, monitors the police crime map.</description>

Now, weather in Thailand&amp;ndash;and the tsunami in Japan&amp;ndash;threaten to upend American politics in the 2012. Your economic future could hang in the balance.

      <description>Writers are always looking for the perfect topic for a book. But thereâs a problem.
Whatâs important to me may not be important to you. And what you to read about, I might not care about.
Thatâs why great books achieve a certain universality. They touch on the essence of life itself, of humanity itself, of existence.
Some say that the secret to perfectly spellbinding stories is a mixture of just three elements: sex, food, and spirit.</description>

      <description>The Tea Party movement faces its greatest danger right now.Â The future of this country, therefore, straddles a sharp and angry line.Â One wrong move and everything that weâve built over the past two and half years will collapse around us.

Occupy Wall Street is a communist idea built on the very same factors that inspired the Tea Party movement. If Tea Partiers let their disdain for the messenger distort our message, the American experiment will end.</description>

      <description>I try not to ask for much.Â Okay, maybe thatâs not true, but Iâm going to ask you a favor, anyway. Mark this down:Â **7:00 pm, Saturday, October 1.Â **
Itâs weird, I know.Â But Iâm asking for three presents in one.
First, my mom and dad celebrate their wedding anniversary this week. (62nd?)Â Second, my wife and I celebrate our wedding anniversary this week.Â Third, next week is my birthday.</description>

      <description>Herman Cain is riding a wave of popularity because of his upset win in the Florida straw poll on Saturday.Â Heâs helped by Rick Perryâs free-fall and Mitt Romneyâs establishmentarianism.Â But Cain is a huge underdog.
Thatâs okay because **America loves an underdog. **
Hereâs what must happen right now for Herman Cain to win:
1.Â Social Media avalanche.Â Get @THEHermanCain trending on Twitter, and keep it there for five consecutive days.</description>

      <description>In 2001, I loaded my three boys, ages 13, 10, and 8 at the time, into the car and headed to downtown St. Louis. The Cubs were in town, and I planned to introduce my boys to the greatest rivalry in pro sports. We parked (for twenty dollars) and headed toward the stadium.
There was only one problem: we didnât have any tickets. I planned to buy some on the street.</description>

Before we go into that, hear me out on the pressure on those candidates.

Well, not all.Â some if itâs my fault, but in a very innocent way.
Planning The After Party
Eisenhower said that planning is essential, but plans are useless.Â He was right.
When we were planning The After Party, we figured about 50, maybe 75,Â people would attend at each one.</description>

      <description>When Jay Nixon decided to ignore the voters, ignore the Missouri Constitution, and ignore the power of the legislature, he spit in our faces. But why?
Maybe because his special session is failing.
Maybe because, to save the centerpiece of that legislation, House Speaker Steve Tilley needed protection from the grass roots.
Maybe because Jay Nixon is as crooked as a dogâs hind leg and doesnât give a hoot about you, your state, your country, or the law.</description>

I have. They remind me of several things. My Uncle Patrick Mahon, for one. Uncle Pat and I watched M_A_S*H reruns every day at 4:00 when I was a kid.Â We met at my Aunt Mameâs house (unwed sister to Pat and my mom).Â Uncle Pat drank coffeeâusually black with sugarâand smoked unfiltered cigarettes.
Uncle Pat retired from the St. Louis Fire Department in about 1976 (rough guess).</description>

When Mark Gillar of Tea Party Power Hour asked me to come onto his show, I broke my rule. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.
First, Mark Gillar&amp;rsquo;s professionalism and sincerity are spectacular. His show is his mission to advance liberty and good government.
Second, Tea Party Power Hour has hosted some amazing guests&amp;ndash;folks I&amp;rsquo;m very honored and very humbled to follow.</description>

      <description>Dig this opening paragraph â&amp;gt;
 As the marathon for the presidency, 1980, begins to quicken, the American electorate is in a singularly sour and pessimistic mood. Not only is the public naturally worried about the economy, energy and inflation, but it doubts things will improve much. The country is anxious to find strong leaders âthe evidence is overwhelmingâand the public has little faith that Jimmy Carter has the ability, let alone the programs, to solve the nation&amp;rsquo;s problems.</description>

They&amp;rsquo;ve got a war, they got a war with us and there&amp;rsquo;s only going to be one winner.</description>

      <description>Maureen Dowdâs having trouble slathering make-up on her favorite pigs these days. Her Presidentâthe man for whom she surrendered all pretense of intelligence, wisdom, and self-controlâis flailing.
And Maureen Dowd is going all wobbly.Â Wobbly on Obama. Wobbly on America.Â Wobbly on life.Â Hereâs an exceprt:
 On the razorâs edge of another recession; blocked at every turn by Republicans determined to slice him up at any cost; starting an unexpectedly daunting re-election bid; and puzzling over how to make a prime-time speech about infrastructure and payroll taxes soar, maybe President Obama is wishing that he had thrown the game.</description>

Now,KMOV Channel 4&amp;rsquo;s Craig Cheatham shines the light on the people buying and selling St. Louis in this series. Not just Aerotropolis, but the whole oligarchy of incompetent, corrupt, and self-serving Boss Hog-types who seem bent on reducing the St. Louis region to irrelevance.</description>

One point that I should have made before being prompted by Edâs speech. Trading Missouri sovereignty for a few pieces of ObamaCare silver is simple cowardice. Governor Nixon, and any Republican who voted for the healthcare exchange, should be retiredâon their own or in a primary.</description>

Read Martinâs challenge:
 Today, I am inviting both of these distinguished ladies to St Louis, Missouri to tell me and my Tea Party compatriots in person why we should go straight to Hell. Congresswoman Waters should know the way here, having been born and raised in our esteemed area and a graduate of Vashon High School, which is in the St Louis Public School District.</description>

 It was just announced in Wisconsin that the unprecedented recall elections of Republicans will take place August 9.
 The leftists dreamed. Visions of a union-boss oligarchy danced in their heads. Posters misquoted Marx and Lenin. Others wanted nothing to do with waiting two months for an election: they were ready to take up arms and violently overthrow the Wisconsin government.</description>

      <description>Warren Buffett makes the erroneous claim that he pays less in taxes than does his secretary. He claims that the government thus âcoddlesâ the rich. He asks the government to increase his taxes, and the taxes of others like him, as if he is incapable of doing that on his own.
Buffett is half right. He proves that government coddles people by** asking the government to solve his problem of guilt**.</description>

      <description>This weekend, MoveOnUp.org held its first conference. The location was the Crowne Plaza Hotel at the airport. The event launched the Sherman T. Parker Scholarship for African-American Political Science students.
But thatâs not the big story.
The big story is this: MoveOnUp.org has cheated history.
Why âcheated?â Because the past 50 years of American liberal history has prepared American blacks for one purpose: compliance.
Using victimhood, welfare, crime, destructive education, and programs designed to destroy families, American liberals from Ted Kennedy to Barack Obama chained African-Americans to âUncle Samâs Plantation,â as Star Parker so aptly puts it.</description>

  That&amp;rsquo;s Andrew Breitbart&amp;rsquo;s commitment to African-American conservatives meeting at the Crowne Plaza Hotel at the airport in St. Louis, Missouri, yesterday.
The three-day &amp;ldquo;Meet Me in the &amp;lsquo;Lou&amp;rdquo; conference is the work of the remarkable people at MoveOnUp.org. Today&amp;rsquo;s day two, and Breitbart is the luncheon speaker.
MoveOnUp.org represents the people that the Civil Rights Industry never wants you to meet: black conservatives, escapees from what Star Parker calls &amp;ldquo;Uncle Sam&amp;rsquo;s Plantation.</description>

      <description>Dale Carnegie, of course.
Published in 1936, Carnagieâs book, How to Make Friends and Influence People, remains one of the most important works in interpersonal human relations ever written.
I wish Iâd been humble enough to read this book when I was younger. Might have saved myself a lot of trouble, reputation, and embarrassment.
Hereâs an excerpt:
 Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking 1. **The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.</description>

      <title>So Much for the Experts</title>

      <description>Rule by the cleverest brute dominated most of human history. Then came the bizarre notion â in Greece and Rome to degrees, but mostly in the USA â of rule by the governed.
Rule by the governed gave way in 20th century to rule by experts.
Many so called âconservativesâ warned against the expert thing. Eventually, conservatives believed, the experts would either fall prey to the clever brutes or to a world too complex for a small group to manage.</description>

      <description>On Saturday, the United States suffered its highest human lost since the Afghanistan conflict began. At least 38 elite, brave American warriors died in combat.
Flasback to May 23 of this year. Thatâs when Barack Obama made the surprise announcement that he would begin accelerated troop withdrawals in July. That timetable meant beginning the withdrawal during the summer fighting season.
Current and former military experts advised the president against this reckless move.</description>

      <description>Answer: Bondbonds.
Sometimes the only option is humor.Â Maybe itâs time to laugh . . . at ourselves, at our pre-occupations, and at our president.
We elected him. And, in a republic, you always get the leadership you deserve.
Now what?
Now focus. Public displays of anger only hurt us. Anger is a tactic.
Yes, Iâm angry. Furious. But acting out on anger does us no good.Â Instead, wise men and women focus that anger into a steely resolve to electorally destroy the cretins that destroyed Americaâs credit rating, liberty, and economy.</description>

      <description>Do you ever feel like Dan Blackford?
Dan is an original Tea Party organizer. Heâs been at it since 2009. And heâs just about worn out. According to the Wall Street Journal, Blackfordâs given up his position in theÂ Houston Tea Party.
 All the protests, the organization, the fundraising, the block-walking, has it done anything? Are we better off than we were two years ago? I say &amp;lsquo;No.â
 How many other people feel the way Dan feels?</description>

      <description>Itâs not the Balanced Budget Amendment, though thatâs a good second choice.
Itâs certainly not senseless and impossible ideas like impeaching Obama or suing over birth certificates.
Instead, we should push an idea thatâs ripe for quick passage. Itâs an idea that cheers political moderates and conservatives. And it doesnât immediately turn off liberals.
What is it?
Itâs an old idea that Jack Kemp championed for decades. Itâs an idea that Iâve written about many times before.</description>

      <description>Thereâs hysteria on both sides.Â From Satan Sandwiches to âkilling future generations,â youâd think Congress is voting on a bill to launch the US nuclear arsenal on Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.
There are reasons to distrust the deal.Â I distrust it.
There are great reasons todistrust the Congressional committee charged with finding more cuts.
The bill does far too little, too slowly,Â to prevent a credit rating cut in the near future.</description>

      <description>Yes, the Tea Party movement influenced what went on in Washington.
No, the Tea Party is not the winner. (No one won.)
No, this debt deal wonât guide the government off the road toward bankruptcy. Hereâs why.
  No Entitlement Fix: In fact, it appears that entitlements arenât touched. Entitlements are the nationâs spending problem. Not roads and bridges, not the military. Entitlements. Until we arrest and reverse growth in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, weâre spitting in the ocean.</description>

      <description>Our present crisis is the result of:
** Too much borrowing ** Too much spending ** Too much government control ** Too much taxing
Those who argue that America needs to borrow, spend, regulate, and tax more are simply wrong, wrong, wrong. Their argument is absurd on its face.
The way to increase revenue to government is to increase the economic activity of the people. You do that by giving the people maximum control over their destinies.</description>

With thanks to Show-Me Institute for their wonderful research.
Points to remember:
** The China Hub is not dependent on Aerotropolis ** The author of the plan thinks it will fail ** St. Louis has 18 million square feet of empty warehouse space right now ** Aerotropolis would hurt many companies who have vacant warehouse space ** Aerotropolis would transfer $360 million tax dollars to just two entities: a private developer and the City of St.</description>

      <description>The headline on July 15 was knee-slapping funny:
 Obama says heâs âready to move**â on debt ceiling. **
 Really?Â The man who dug a deeper debt hole in two years than anyone else did in 8âor 15âis willing to borrow more?
Say it ainât so.
For those who believe Obamaâs some sort of deficit hawk, letâs take a quick stroll down memory.
 Obama wanted to increase the debt limit by $2.</description>

Dana Loesch is a champion of liberty, the conservative grassroots, and everything else we stand for. And sheâs a great friend to me, to the Tea Party, and, in a sense, to all of us. Sheâs elevated this movement locally and nationally like no one else. You wouldnât be reading this post if not for her.

Mike Flynn, the editor of Big Government, has quietly (and not so quietly) led the fight for liberty and good government for decades. His Big Government site has been a backbone in the resurgence of our first principles.
Much more importantly to me, Mike Flynn is a friend of mine.</description>

      <description>Your FICO score is a number between 380 and 820 (or something like that) that banks use to determine your credit worthiness. The higher your FICO score, the better.
But thatâs not what Iâm talking about here.
Iâm talking about your FICA score.

Your FICA score is the minimum payment on your federal loan.
You didnât know you had a federal loan? You do.
If youâre 18 years old, you owe the federal government about $46,000.</description>

And you can buy that 56-inch 3D LED TV youâve been craving. In a few months, you might even be able to buy a new carâon your kidâs credit.

      <description>Iâll be honest with you: Iâve lied.
Usually out of desperation. Iâve lied to those closest to meâthose most willing to forgive the thing I lied about.
Iâve also told the truth to my own detriment. In the long run, the latter works best. In fact, telling the truth works best in the short run, too.
So maybe Obamaâs desperate. Maybe he knows that the debt ceiling debate is the beginning of the unraveling of Americum Sovieticum, his life-long dream.</description>

      <description>Obama showed his breaking point today. The stress got to him.
Today Obama threatened to stop Social Security payments if Congress doesnât bend to his will on the debt ceiling.
The president told reporters that there may not be enough money to pay Social Security benefits on and after August 3rd.
But the President lies.
Revenue from taxes and other fees would cover Social Security and other payments. What wonât be covered is additional borrowing to service the countryâs already outrageous debt.</description>

      <description>With the debt ceiling negotiations closing in, itâs worth looking to Thomas Jefferson.

Jefferson was very opposed to federal government borrowing. (He was less concerned with states borrowing.) What I love about the quote below is Jeffersonâs concern for leisure time.
 &amp;ldquo;To preserve [the] independence [of the people,] we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.</description>

      <description>Roy Blunt has not given an inch in thebattle over the debt ceiling. He deserves high praise for his resolve.
During the 2010 Republican primary, many on the right questioned Blunt&amp;rsquo;s fiscal conservative credentials. As a member of the House, Blunt had helped craft some and pass unpopular spending bills, including TARP. On theissue of debt and responsibility, though, he shows no sign of cracking.

      <description>July 4, 2011, felt hollow, like celebrating the birthday of someone deceased.
Independence Day celebrates the birth of an idea: that people create governments and empower them, not the other way around.
Do we still believe that?

Yes, I still believe that. Morally, at least. And you probably do, too.
Does America still believe that government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed? Or do we, as a nation, believe that government has a monopoly on liberty and dispenses it at its will?</description>

      <description>A Harvard study recently concluded that attending American Independence Day celebrations could turn kids into Republicans.

The reason 4th of July creates Republicans has nothing to do with patriotism and everything to do with education. Hereâs why:
* On July 4th, we celebrate the Declaration of Independence, not the founding of the United States. (That would come with the passage of the Constitution thirteen years later).** July 4th events teach kidsâin an environment free from teacher-union propagandaâthe _reasons_ we broke from England.</description>

I drove through Forest Park feeling the rhythm of the yellow street lights as I moved between light and dark. &amp;ldquo;Memory&amp;rdquo; from Cats came on the radio. I lit a Camel (no filter).
I was free.

The trams take you to the top of the 632 foot Gateway Arch in St. Louis. The uncomfortable ride takes only a few minutes.
Except when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.

Since President Obama took office, gas prices have nearly doubled. The administration refuses to develop American energy sourcesâ¦American energy sources that could help gas prices, electricity prices, and food prices come down.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rdquo; could refer to anything. Anything at all.
In this case, though, I&amp;rsquo;m referring to unemployment. Well, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m referring to the economy overall.
Unemployment rate rises to 9.1%, 54K jobs added Â« Hot Air
Obama has increased regulation, seized entire industries (auto, student loans, commercial banking, medicine), and borrowed more money faster than all previous presidents combined.
Obama is a one-dictator disaster. And an incompetent one at that.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a job, Obama made it worse.</description>

      <description>Iâll save you some time: itâs Ed Martin.
Please Consider
Iâve met the former Missouri GOP head and former US Ambassador to Luxembourg a couple of times. Ann Wagner is smart, funny, and engaging. I think sheâd make an outstanding Republican candidate for the US House. If elected, sheâd serve Missouri well.
Missouri and the tea party wonât be the big winners if Ann Wagner gets the nomination, though. That distinction would go to the Missouri Republican establishmentâthe same establishment that the tea party hopes to reform or replace.</description>

      <description>Thereâs a âspecialâ school in St. Louis County. Its seniors graduated on last Friday.

How sad it must be for those kids. Theyâre not graduating from the districtâs ânormalâ schools with their peers. For various reasons, theyâve been relegated to a school for misfits.
Seeing the building makes the bad feelings worse. Itâs a former grade school, crammed inconveniently behind a bank and a Taco Bell. Its Eisenhower era architecture stands out amidst its Mortgage Boom surroundings like a dandelion on golf course.</description>

      <description>David Brooksâthe former conservativeâskewered the University of Missouri St. Louis yesterday. Brooks wasnât aware, and UMSL administrators donât read. But some of us caught it.
Brooks wrote of The Missing Fifth. **Did you know that 20 percent of American men in their primes donât work? **
 Americans should be especially alert to signs that the country is becoming less vital and industrious. One of those signs comes to us from the labor market.</description>

      <description>The University of Missouri St. Louis uses tax dollars to provide a recruiting station for the Communist Party USAâan organization whose purpose is to shred the United States Constitution.
UMSL Student Philip Christofanelli heroically chronicles the remarkable Marxist indoctrination known as âIntroduction to Labor Studiesâ on BigGovernment.com.Â Iâll give you a taste:
 Prof. Giljum then introduced Tony Pecinovsky, a local organizer for the Communist Party, who proceeded to speak to us for two hours about the beliefs of the Communist Party and the benefits of membership.</description>

      <description>Over 6,000 American and 10,000 allied warriors gave their lives as a result of Bin Laden&amp;rsquo;s evil. These nn addition to the 3,000 who died 9/11 and the tens of thousands of others who&amp;rsquo;ve died at Bin Laden&amp;rsquo;s hand.
Since Ollie North&amp;rsquo;s testimony to Congress during the Iran-Contra Hearings in the Reagan Administration, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working toward this one man&amp;rsquo;s death.

Sheâs telling the Kansas City Star that sheâs receiving threats from people upset that she teaches students to threaten others.
I oppose violence, sabotage, and intimidation as political tools.Â But Judy Ancelâs message of violence seems to have gotten through to some people.

      <description>Gail Hackett, UMKC Provost, released a deceitful, false, and irresponsible defense of UMKC instructors who encouraged students to use violence, sabotage, and intimidation to their way.
But Gail Hackett refuses to answer hard questions.
I have one question for the UMKC Provost: ****
**Do you agree with Don Giljumâs statement âI believe in a violent overthrow of Bourgeois?â **
Before you answer, remember that Giljumâs use of the personal term âBourgoisâ instead of the the class âbourguoisieâ indicates that Giljim believes in violence against individual members of the middle class.</description>

First, KMOX is reporting that an UMSL professor has resigned** over the controversy**.Â For the life of me, I cannot find who the professor is. I thought that everyone involved was either an instructor or a guest lecturer.Â If you know the answer to the riddle, please use the comment form.

      <description>Did I say âTea Party Leader?â ** I meant labor union leader Don Giljum condones violence, intimidation, and sabotage.** Giljumâs the business manager for Operating Engineers Local 148 and a lecturer at University of Missouri-St. Louis. Itâs in the UMSL classroom that he pontificates and brags about the . . . the uglier side of negotiations.
Hereâs what he actually said about violence for political purposes:

âBig tentâ is Republican for âsurrender.â Itâs not for me.

Missouri House Speaker Steve Tilley (R-Perryville) has signed onto legislation designed to circumvent the Electoral College in presidential elections. Like his position on embryonic stem cell research and the national debt, Tilley seems far out of step with Missouriâs Republican base on this. And this guy wants to be Lt. Governor?Â Please.
This might be old news to some.

      <description>Face it: you donât have that many friends. Not that you can rely on, anyway.
On the bright side, you donât really need friends, do you?Â Youâre a rock star in your own small way. Who made the varsity swim team?Â You did.Â Who made honor rolls and deansâ lists? You did.Â Who landed your job and got the bonus? You did.
With friends like yourself, who needs friends?
If you make 20 times as much as the next guy in line at Target, who cares?</description>

      <description>Four men risked their political lives to help solve the problem of our lifetimes, but they forgot to massage Steve Tilleyâs monstrous ego.
  When John McCain (R-AZ) and Roy Blunt (R-MO) agree with Michele Bachmann and Rush Limbaugh, you can bet the issue is beyond debate.
In this case, the issue is the massive U.S. debt and what that debt is about to do to America.

      <description>Patrick Tuohey made some good points about the office of Lieutenant Governor.Â Based on that, I thought up all the possible reasons someone would run for LooeyG.
1.Â Stepping Stone:Â Establish state-wide name recognition and give yourself plenty of time to run for that next office, like U.S. Senate or Governor.
2.Â Party Reptile:Â If the governor is or is likely to be of the opposite party, you get to be the de facto head of your party in the state.</description>

      <description>Letâs face it: the Missouri GOP has become a club to advance the careers of a select few favorites. It is not a party to advance conservative principles.
And that needs to change here and now.
And that means some old names need to retire.
Hereâs just one example of the ideological impotence of the Missouri Republican Party:Â The St. Louis County Assessor.
The GOP created the St. Louis County Assessorâs office because of corruption and incompetence in the political patronage version of the office under Democrats Buzz Westfall and Charlie Dooley.</description>

State Senators Jim Lembke (@jimlembke), Brian Nieves (@briannieves), Rob Schaaf (@robschaaf), and Will Kraus stood for principle. And the left immediately went berserk.
The collectivistsâthose who hate personal achievement and fiscal responsibility in governmentâwill target these men.Â We must have their backs.

      <description>POâed Patriot has the story.
Jake Zimmermanâs campaign rotates two themes:
  The St. Louis County Assessor should be a career political hack, not a seasoned real estate professional
  His little old friend, Margaret, is in danger of losing her home.
  But mostly St. Louis County government needs more Democrat political hacks.
Turns out that, just like Jakeâs dad, his friend Margaret, a rather unsuccessful real estate investor, got a break on her property taxes.</description>

      <description>The Post-Dispatch says the County Assessor should be a political operative, not an expert in real estate values like L. K. âChipâ Wood. I disagree, and this story explains why Charlie Dooleyâs regime needs fewer political hacks and more competent professionals.
Troubling Questions for Zimmermanâs Assessor Campaign:
 * Why did the Zimmerman campaign take screen shots of Zimmermanâs dadâs real estate values on January 13, 2011, the day he was selected?</description>

Defense Secretary: Libya Did Not Pose Threat to U.S., Was Not &amp;lsquo;Vital National Interest&amp;rsquo; to Intervene
The rest of Jake Tapperâs story gets more disturbing.
* The President and the Defense Secretary seem to disagree on national interest** The Secretary of State cannot articulate a consistent US policy** Hillary Clinton seems to believe that the UN is a legal alternative to the US Congress  More than week into a war that lacks even the thinnest thread of Constitutionality, Barack Obama seems clueless.</description>

      <description>Register today for Vacation Liberty School. Here&amp;rsquo;s 3 reasons why you should:
 Most school systems don&amp;rsquo;t care about liberty; they care about conformity. The only way kids will learn an appreciation for the blessings of libertyis if their parents send them to schools that put liberty at the center of the cirriculum. That&amp;rsquo;s what Vacation Liberty School does.
  Many teachers would love to teach more about the blessings of liberty to their skulls full of mush, but they can&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>On Monday, we learned that US Senator Claire McCaskill failed to pay property taxes on her personal luxury jet for three years. Previously, she had charged taxpayers some of the cost of operating her private plane. Before that, it seems, she registered the plane in property tax-free Delaware.
On Monday, Claire wrote a $287,000 check without batting an eye. Now, St. Louis County says she owes them another $33,000 in interest and penalties, for a total bill of $320,000.</description>

      <description>Historians will mark March 19 as the day the Obama presidency reached its point of no return.
The image of a cowardly and selfish child-president flying to Brazil to launch a war will haunt his legacy, like Nixonâs vulgarities on tape in 1974. Obamaâs war on Libya has doomed an already weak administration.
Today, Germany pulled out of NATO because of the bungled, late, and idiotic intervention. It appears, now, that the alliance that won the Cold War and help sustain two decades of peace could collapse under a lack of American leadership.</description>

      <description>What many people don&amp;rsquo;t get is that cooperation is not the same as consensus.

Cooperation means someone takes the lead on an issue. If it makes sense, and if the leader is perceived to have good character and judgment, others follow. Otherwise, the project is stillborn. It&amp;rsquo;s the way the market picks leaders. Not through org charts, but through action and response.
One person may be the leader on one issue and a cooperator on many others.</description>

      <description>When the US invaded Iraq in 2003, it do so with the clear intent of bringing its enemyâSaddamâs regimeâto an unconditional surrender. That was the objective.Â Despite what happened after that objective was achieved, we went in with a clear and measurable purpose.
The motivating reason for our foray into Iraq was also clear.Â We believed at the time that Saddam Husseinâs possession of &amp;ndash; and desire for more &amp;ndash; weapons of mass destruction posed an imminent threat to US interests and citizens.</description>

      <description>According to a book by historians Neil Howe and William Strauss, history follows a fairly predictable pattern, rotating in cycles equal to a long human life. The book, The Fourth Turning, was written in 1997.
Read it.
If Howe and Strauss are rightâand so far, theyâre dead onâthen we recently entered a Fourth Turning in the current saeculum which they named âmillennium.â
What is a Fourth Turning?
 The Fourth Turning is a Crisis, a decisive era of secular upheaval, when the values regime propels the replacement of the old civic order with a new one.</description>

The conversation had been on Japan leading up to World War II. The question was important. Why would a nation conquer dissimilar nations? Why accept that burden and risk?
My answer, which Iâve grown more fond of as timeâs passed, was something like this: Imperial people view everything as a fixed pie.</description>

But here are three scientifically proven steps to being happier. And since happiness causes success in other areas, not the other way around, these could be the most important tasks you perform.
Give Thanks

      <description>Doing the right thing is hard.
Doing the right thing after years of practicing the wrong things is even harder.
  When your senate separated the fiscal responsibility provisions affecting union collective bargaining powers from a bill that previously included tax and spend provisions, you took a big step toward fiscal recovery.
For years, public sector unions have dictated statesâ taxing spending policies through brute force. These unions were not elected by the people, but the people were forced to payâor borrowâwhat the unions demanded.</description>

      <description>Did you know that thereâs an election on April 5? And itâs just as important an election as last Novemberâs historic election.

https://www.chipwoodforassessor.com/index1.html
This time, you and I have the job to elect Chip Wood for County Assessor.* Hereâs why.
In 2010, voters created an elected assessorâs office in St. Louis County. The Republicans pushed for this new office because of corruption, abuse, and waste in the County Assessorâs office under Charlie Dooley.</description>

      <description>Iâve written about this before.
The problem with traffic signals is that they make all of the problems theyâre designed to solve worse. By âall the problemsâ I mean: * Pollution * Congestion * Deaths * Accidents * Speed of Transit * Risk to pedestrians (except those with certain disabilities)
Banning red light cameras is a great first step, but the ultimate goal should be elimination of traffic lights altogether.</description>

      <description>The federal budget deficit in the month of February 2011 exceeds the deficit for all of 2007 by 40 percent.
Simply staggering.
Yet Senate Democrats refuse to cut more than a paltry $6 billion. They refuse because they seem bent on collapsing the American system â the economy, the government, and the people themselves.
But at least the Obama administration stands by with its arms folded as gasoline prices skyrocket at the their fastest pace in history.</description>

      <description>Iâm getting a lot of requests to pump news about Claire McCaskillâs comments to Democrats. According to Brian R. Hook of Missouri Watchdog, McCaskill gave Democrats a set of instructions very similar to those I usually give at the end of Tea Party rallies. (Only Claireâs instructions seem a bit less human than mine.)
Some national political scientists believe McCaskillâs Senate seat is one of the most vulnerable in 2012.</description>

Of course, theyâre not really inviting me to speak; theyâre inviting the thousands of St. Louis area activists who have done so much to advance liberty and defend freedom over the past 25 months.</description>

 Major props to Brian Nieves and Jim Lembke for their continued commitment to conservatism in the MO Senate with HB 163 - refusing federal funds for another unemployment extension that costs taxpayers $81 million. They&amp;rsquo;re standing their ground against some of their fellow GOP who need to be reminded what fiscal conservatism is.</description>

What do I mean by that?
Look at whatâs going on in Wisconsin. The people who represent the net tax payersâthose who pay more in taxes to the state than they receive in salaryâare being vilified, harassed, threatened, and assaulted by the net tax takersâthose receive more in state wages than they pay in state taxes.</description>

Since then, over 1,000 state and federal offices have changed hands.Â In nearly 100 percent of these switches moves power from the privileged to the people. Some more than others. Some not enough.Â But an amazing reversal of trends, nonetheless.</description>

      <description>I continue hearing reliable reports that the GOP Leadership in the Missouri House keeps its boot on the throat of Tea Party freshmen.
What a shame.
The party that was flat on its back from 2006 to 2009 rose back to power because of the tea party. But, it seems, the Missouri branch of the party didnât get the message. And its Speaker in the Missouri House has become tighter with left-fringe Democrats that with conservatives of his own party.</description>

As youâll see in the video from P/Oed Patriot and Sharp Elbows, the site of the Constitution at a union rally is like a crucifix and a pound of garlic in a vampire den. You can actually watch as the documentâs presence weakens the aging leftists.</description>

These arenât unions that represent people who work in mines and factories. No, these are unions representing people who live off your and my tax dollars. (BTW,the military doesnât have a union.)

The National Education Association is a radical, political organization whose primary purpose is not education but control. Threatened with sensible legislation that protects the people of Wisconsin from unsustainable and unjustified retirement benefits, these teachers decided to shut down Wisconsinâs schools.
The solution is simple. Do what Reagan did to PATCO.</description>

Republicans dominate both houses of the Missouri legislature. Youâd think theyâd act like republicans (lower case). But when it comes to education bribes from Washington, many of our Republican legislators show little resistance to political seduction. We can help them.

Down the road, a group of Cardinals fans held a demonstration outside Busch Stadium. The future of future Hall of Famer Albert Pujols is important, too.</description>

In two casesâthe Gulf oil drilling ban and Obamacareâthe White House refuses to obey ruling from federal judges. In New Orleans, federal judge Martin Feldman found the White House in contempt for its re-imposition of oil drilling bans after his previous ruling to the contrary.</description>

      <description>Did you enjoy President Obamaâs gooey nostalgia for the Happy Days of Eisenhower and Howdy Doody as much I did?

Saul Alinsky warned radicals to ânever go outside the expertise of your people.â But desperate times call for desperate measures, so Obama jumped the shark to the time of Potsy and Fonzie and Joannie Loves Chachi to rekindle a flavor of Americana that died a couple of years before Obama was born.</description>

      <description>An old boss of mine liked âforcing functions.â Forced us to meet delivery dates, while arbitrary dates tended to cause a âso whatâ attitude toward deadlines. Forcing functions like trade shows, magazine reviews, and client launches forced development teams to ship, no matter what.
Keep that in mind for a moment while we look at the Obama Administration.
Barack Obama campaigned on a promise to clip Americaâs wings. I know he didnât use that term, but it was clear what he meant when he visited the Mediterranean and Germany.</description>

      <description>U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson today ruled Obamacare directly violates the Constitution by mandating that citizens buy health insurance.
This ruling goes further than the previous Virginia ruling. Judge Vinson declared the entire Obamacare bill unconstitutional because the individual mandate portion is not severable from the rest of the law.
Third, Judge Vinson granted the plaintiffs âdeclaratory relief,â the functional equivalent of an injunction, freeing them from the burden of compliance.</description>

      <description>Last week I wrote about Creating Shared Value. In that post, I pointed to a Harvard Business Review article by Michael Porter and Mark Kramer. If you havenât read both my post and the Michael Porter piece, please do so now. Iâll wait.
Now that youâre up to date, let me add the Tea Party angle to this.
Though Porter did not dwell on governmentâs role in Creating Shared Value (CSV), he did point out that government must reform for CSV to succeed.</description>

      <description>The news might seem unimportant to us in the USA:
 Day after day they marched, tens of thousands strong, defiant chanting demonstrators surging through the streets of Cairo, a capital unaccustomed to the shouts and echoes of dissent. The subject of their protest was the policies of Egyptâs supreme ruler, Hosni Mubarak. Some carried signs demanding his ouster. Others called for a return of long denied civil and political liberties and the enforcement of Islamic laws.</description>

      <description>Many of the people who support eliminating state oversight of the St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners are not conservatives. Decidedly not.
There are some good conservatives who disagree over the Board of Police Commissioners for the City of St. Louis. Iâve heard some of these conservative make some strong arguments for abolishing the board or relinquishing it to St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay.
Some of the arguments in favor of so-called âhome ruleâ are flat out false.</description>

      <description>I am a big fan of Milton Friedman. Iâm also becoming a big fan of Creating Shared Value. Some believe the two values are inconsistent, but I disagree.
In 2005, Reason Magazine posted an online debate between Friedman and Whole Foods Market CEO John Mackey. The debate coincided with the 35th anniversary of Friedmansâ famous The New York Times Magazine article entitled: : &amp;ldquo;The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits.</description>

I donât know who my fellow panelists will be, but I think itâs pretty cool that a local network invited a tea partier to help break down the Presidentâs State of the Union speech.
The speech starts at 8:00 p.m. CT Tuesday, January 25 on KSDK 5.</description>

Suppose you did something stupid. You blamed the wrong person, for instance, for a capital crime. Then supposed one of your comrades compounded your . . . error . . . by threatening to kill someone on national television?
If youâre an American leftist, you might double down by issuing even more death threats to even more people.
Thatâs whatâ happening right now in America. Death threats are pouring into Trent Humphries, Tucson Tea Party organizer, Dana Loesch, Sarah Palin (who vows not to be silenced), Glenn Beck, and more.</description>

      <description>Last week, Americaâs sleaziest leftistsâBill Maher, Chris Matthews, Keith Olbermann, E. J. Dionne, Paul Krugman, others â have [executed a prepared propaganda war](https://hennessysview.com/crime/a-national-day-of-shame/) against anyone who disagrees with them. Their theorem is: vitriolic rhetoric inspires conservatives to act out in violence.
Unfortunately for the loony left, there was no evidence to support their theorem. The evidence they falsely pointed toâJarod Lee Loughnerâs deranged murder rampage in Tucsonâwas determined to be a lie only hours after the event.</description>

      <description>Last week, the Illinois legislature passed a massive income tax increase on individuals and businesses.Â Overall, it represents about a 67 percent income tax increase.
In response, neighboring states of Wisconsin and Indiana have wisely mounted massive campaigns to suck businesses and people out of Illinois.Â Even New Jerseyâs fabulous governor, Chris Christie, plans to fish the Land oâ Lincoln for some business transplants.
One state bordering Illinois has been notoriously silent.</description>

      <description>Just as in 2001, some Republicans are falling for Democrat mind games. In 2001, it was the shared leadership arrangement in the Senate, even thought the GOP had the majority because of the VP tie-break. This year, itâs beginning with âbi-partisanâ seating at the State of the Union address.
I have one message for Republicans: Knock it the hell off.
When a Democrat offers to reach across the aisle, with very few exceptions, itâs to poison a Republican.</description>

In the memo, obtained by Fox News and posted on Greta Van Susterenâs blog, the DHS agent openly speculates about undue internal influence. Thatâs because Loughnerâs arrests donât all end with reasonable closure, if you will.
Hereâs exactly what the DHS report says:

Itâs bad enough that a dozen or more people were shot.
Itâs bad enough that a deranged man attacked our American system.
But Americaâs liberal elite turned the tragedy into a national day of shame.Â They accomplished this by callously and capriciously blaming innocent political opponents for the violence.Â When confronted with facts to the contrary, liberals, including Paul Krugman, CBS News, the New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, Jane Fonda, Sheriff Dupnick of Pima County Arizona, and others, continued to lie, slander, and libel the tea party, Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, and conservatives in general.</description>

LIBERAL PRESS ERRONEOUSLY BLAMES TEA PARTY FOR LEFTIST CRIMES
As Jarod Lee Loughnerâs political bent emerges, we see the same, predictable story playing out:
1. A horrific crime takes place.*2. Leftist bloggers like Markos Moulitsas blame conservatives.*3. CNN, New York Times, Washinton Post, etc.</description>

Andrew Breitbart points out on Twitter that his cowardly leftist accusors, including Markos Moulitsas and Eric Boehlert, quieted down on their libelous attacks on Breitbart, Palin, Bush, and Tea Party.
These leftist cowards shut up only after it became undeniably clear that the evil bastard who shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 11 others is not a tea partier, but a deranged socialist.</description>

      <description>Update: Gateway Pundit has much more on the alleged shooter.
These appear to be the paranoid ramblings of the man in custody for shooting Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 11 others, including a federal judge, in Tucson, AZ. Lots of hard left references in his favorite books, including Mein Kampf and The Communist Manifesto. Politicoâs Ben Smith calls Laughnerâs writings âsocialist.â

      <description>Like all decent people, I am disgusted to hear the sad news out of Tucson, AZ: Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) was shot and killed along with four others today. Twelve were shot altogether. The murderer was apprehended by heroic bystanders and is in custody.
Not sure of the young murdererâs motives. Iâm sure they werenât worth killing or dying for. Except to him.
Please prayer for the souls of the faithful departed, the well-being of their families, the quick recovery of the wounded, and the delivery of justice.</description>

      <description>Momentum is the mass and velocity of an object.
The object is the American ideology.
The impetus is the conservative grassroots.
The velocity is medium.
The direction is right.
The tactics and tools to keep the dominos falling to the right might change, but the energy and ideals donât. What brought you out to the tea parties, to the street parties, to the lit drops, and to the door knocking and phone banking parties must carry you forward in 2011 and 2012.</description>

      <description>Four years after Nancy Pelosi swore to end deficit spending, a new Congress, elected by a grassroots surge, took office today.
Our work has just begun.
But we have the momentum.
Hereâs how we need to deal with Congress:
1.Â We let them know whatâs important to us.
2.Â We defend themâindividually and collectivelyâwhen they do the right thing.
3.Â We remind them of their purpose, promises, and limitations when they stray.</description>

      <title>3 Moves After the Tea Party*</title>

      <description>Itâs 2011. The Tea Party movement is almost two years old.
Two years after the Boston Tea party, the Revolutionary War was well underway. In April, 1775, British Lieutenant General Gage sent troops to Concord, Massachusetts, to seize a garrison held by revolutionaries. It didnât go so well for the Brits.

By 1776, the Continental Congress declared our independence from Great Britain citing human rights. With words that echo through the centuries, we declared that human beings have certain rights, and:</description>

      <description>Clearly a fan of understatement, Ezra Klein once ran a blog called âNot Geniuses.â Now, of course, he demonstrates his ignorance on MSNBC.
Last week, Klein unwittingly advanced the cause of dead constitutions. He did a better job than any proponent could. He said:
 The issue with the Constitution is that the text is confusing because it was written more than a hundred years ago.
 (William F. Buckley once described a statement like Kleinâs as evoking of the sort of pity one feels for the ignorance of animals.</description>

      <description>The year that ends tonight didnât begin a year a go tomorrow. Nor does it have a number.
Iâm not sure when this year started or what to call it. And, as surprising as it may sound, I donât think Iâll miss it.
Call it the year of the tea party. It lasted 22 months.
We accomplished only two things, really, in this massive human wave.
  We reminded ourselves that we, the people, can still roar.</description>

      <description>This week last year, I read The 5000 Year Leap. Good book. If you havenât read it, do so. You might learn some interesting things.
But donât expect The 5000 Year Leap to change you. Or history. It wonât.
Now, if 70 percent of the US population read it, it might make a difference. Or maybe not. I tend to doubt it, but thatâs fodder for a different post.
When tea partiers read books like Glenn Beckâs Common Sense or The 5000 Year Leap, weâre not broadening ourselvesâweâre narrowing ourselves.</description>

      <description>Politicians donât seek money. They seek power. They use money to acquire power. Once they have the power, money becomes irrelevant.
Did you see how states behaved last summer? The âRace to the Topâ is all you need to know about the relationship between government money, power, and degradation.
The Race to the Top education initiative dangled cash in front of states. Most states, including Missouri, bit. They competed against each other for the privilege of surrendering their sovereignty over education to a DoE overlord.</description>

      <description>Yes, I read that. And I saw that. And somebody told me about that, too.
I see the ridiculous charges leveled by ignorant bigots against the Tea Party. I hear the slander on MSNBC and CNN. I know that Ben Jealous and Nancy Pelosi live on lies about you and me the way vampires live on human blood.
I get it.
My immediate urge when I read or hear this nonsense is anger.</description>

      <description>This is my opinion, and itâs not all about politics. Nor are they necessarily in any particular order. Save for one. (Youâll see.)

      <description>Perhaps the most famous of all of Karl Marxâs writings was the clause âyou have nothing to lose but your chains.â
Many people still believe that human beings are chained to corporate masters. Writers like Seth Godin talk about an awakening in which workers refuse to remain cogs in someone elseâs machine.
These well-meaning people (some are well-meaning, anyway) have no problem, though with giving more power to a handful of slave-masters in Washington.</description>

      <description>Christmas is the holiday about humility.
The humility of the immortal and all powerful and all knowing stooping to become a mere human being.
The humility of God and king to live among the humblest and poorest&amp;ndash;a carpenter&amp;rsquo;s son.
The humility of belonging to a race so broken that our Creator sent his only Son to redeem us.
For me, the humblest part of this season is what I&amp;rsquo;m doing right now.</description>

      <description>If the Tea Partyâor ACORN or the Democratic National Committee or anyone or anything else, for that matterâstays in a perpetual state of heightened negative emotions nothing positive gets accomplished.
The gazelle that flees imaginary lions soon dies of exhaustion. As positive emotions researcher Barbara Frederickson puts it:
 when extreme, prolonged, or contextually inappropriate, negative emotions can trigger a wide array of problems for individuals and for society.
 Phobias develop out of unchecked fear.</description>

Between WordPressâs false negatives on reporting success of links, my laptopâs touchy touchpad, and Typepadâs weird trackback URL system, I managed to:
a. Link once to the wrong blog post
b. Link twice to the right blog post
I pride myself on being respectful of blogging etiquette. I hate trackback spam. I hate it even more when Iâm the one creating it.</description>

      <description>I am a big fan of Seth Godinâs thinking. He clearly understands that people are rejecting steep hierarchies where an oligarchy makes all the decisions and the rest of us are expected to blindly follow instructions.
He wrote a wonderful book on the subject. Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?  holds some wisdom (and some fallacy) that will empower you to take control of your life if you listen.</description>

      <description>How many new voters has the tea party movement created? Thereâs reason to hope that first time voters will begin shifting to the right in 2010. Thereâs also reason for us on the right to worry.
About 8 million people turned 18 since the 2008 election. While the left undoubtedly brainwashed   many of them before they reached voting age, many others avoided indoctrination through good parenting, good thinking, or simply not paying attention to the leftâs message.</description>

A guy sitting behind me at a restaurant in Lambert airport began singing along with the background music. âBurning down the house (do do).â
Perfect.

November 2, American voters burned down the U.S. House. Before the vote, estimates ranged from 45 to 70 seats switching from Democrats to Republicans. Burning down the house, indeed. The final number was 63.</description>

      <description>Conservatives (tea party, et al) and Republicans better learn to get along. Quickly. Just as quickly, the two need to recruit, vet, and prep some A-list candidates. Candidates for offices from President down to school boards.
Thatâs because the winners in 2012 will either belong to a conservative coalition or the most radical elements of the Democrat Party. Hereâs why.
Pollster Frank Luntz points out in todayâs Washington Post that the largest ideological faction in the United States is the combination of GOP plus tea partiers:</description>

Sometimes they donât.
Salon carries a depressing story for the lower 48 of North America. Author Alfred McCoy writes:
 Despite the aura of omnipotence most empires project, a look at their history should remind us that they are fragile organisms. So delicate is their ecology of power that, when things start to go truly bad, empires regularly unravel with unholy speed: just a year for Portugal, two years for the Soviet Union, eight years for France, 11 years for the Ottomans, 17 years for Great Britain, and, in all likelihood, 22 years for the United States, counting from the crucial year 2003.</description>

      <description>We talk about liberty, limited government, freedom, Constitutional principles, and the like. Those are all relevant to the purposes of the conservative grassroots movement. But are they ends? Or are they just means?
I believe they are means. In the foundersâ writings we find clues to the end, even they donât state it explicitly. Jefferson did. Jay came close. And Adams implicitly understood that end.

Let me ask this: whatâs the point of all the work we did in the past two years?</description>

      <description>Is it better to give or to receive?
Before you answer, letâs look at some of the science behind giving. Then letâs look a little deeper.
Dr. Barbara Fredrickson studies the psychology of happiness. About a decade ago, Dr. Fredrickson announced a formula for creating an âupward spiralâ of happiness. In other words, she identified what it takes to have happiness breed happiness. The formula applies to individuals, families, groups, and even companies.</description>

      <description>Itâs easy to wonder whether humanity has simply grown weary of life.
* Yesterday I noted the [inhumanity of Christmas shoppers](https://hennessysview.com/2010/11/28/our-disordered-society/) on Black Friday.** For the past 24 hours, the world has watched the slow release of hundreds of thousands of [classified US diplomatic cables](https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/sc-dc-1130-wikileaks-20101129,0,2557036.story).** As I write, [a gunman holds hostages](https://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/11/29/wisconsin.hostage/?hpt=T2) at a rural Wisconsin high school.** The [European debt crisis](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/11/29/europes_ominous_reckoning_108078.html) refuses to remain quiet beneath the rug under which itâs been swept.</description>

      <description>Drudgeâs headlines about Black Friday 2010 raise disturbing questions about Americaâs purpose as a nation.

We degrade ourselves for deals on crap some puppet-master tells us we cannot live without. In the name of Christâs birth, we reveal ourselves with headlines like âCraze shoppers stampede,â âMarine stabbed,â âShopper arrested after packing gun,â âMall food court placed on lockdown,â âShopper arrestedâ¦raging,â âPolice called after thousands rush,â âWoman busted.â
We rush Toys-R-Us doors&amp;ndash;angry, armed, and belligerent&amp;ndash;because our society is grossly disordered.</description>

      <description>Exit polling tells the story. About 60 percent of voters agree with the tea party core principles of government constrained by a constitution and government transparency. Well over half of voters agree with specific measures advanced in the Contract From America, including:
  Balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.
  Elimination of earmarks until the budget is balanced, and then requiring a 2/3 vote.
  Audit the entire damn government, including the Fed.</description>

      <description>When Barack Obama became president in January 2009, he began a campaign to weaken America. Iâm not talking about military cuts; Iâm speaking of Americaâs stature. Barack Obama famously refused to acknowledge American Exceptionalism in 2009. He bowed to kings and princes, then denied doing so, then bowed again and again. His White House has driven down the dollar. Timothy Geithner, Obamaâs Secretary of the Treasury, warns that the world economy must ârebalanceâ with less reliance on America.</description>

      <description>When you vote for a candidate for high office, sometimes you do so with fingers crossed. You just donât know how theyâll handle the new responsibilities. Will they succumb to pressure and influence? Or will they remain true?
Luckily for us, Senator-elect Roy Blunt showed his courage in a recent Wall Street Journal article about the Tea Party and the GOP.
In a year when voters overwhelming demanded changes to business as usual in Washington, Roy Blunt showed he has the rectitude to stand strong for the tried and true practices of obfuscation, political double-speak, and deflection.</description>

      <description>Election Night. Already know that Christine OâDonnell lost. Not surprised. Rubio won going away. Not surprised. Roy Blunt already projected winner in Missouri. No word on Ed Martin, the race Iâm most interested in.
Iâm usually glued to radio, TV, and internet on election nights. Iâm usually In The Know. Sort of a cruel cosmic joke that Iâm at 35,000 feet as returns come in for the most important election in a century.</description>

      <description>Three precincts in the city of St. Louis delivered 3,800 votes for Carnahan in the last hour of counting. Wahbyâs district. Wahbyâs wife works for Mayor Francis Slay. They waited until they knew how many votes they needed, then they manufactured them&amp;ndash;typical Dems, in my view.
Now I ask you: how many dead or non-existent people voted in Wahbyâs precincts?
Ed Martin won, and everyone knows it. City Democrats have no qualms with committing felonies to steal elections.</description>

      <description>Six hundred fourteen days from the first Tea Parties to Election Day. Thatâs 307 days in 2009 and 307 in 2010.
In that time, weâve met so many people. Weâve made too many friends. (Psychologists and sociologists and anthropologists believe that a person can manage no more than 150 human relationships, so there is such a thing as too many friends.) Most of us, Iâm afraid, have seen friendships end, too.</description>

      <description>The clock is ticking on dozens of Democrat congressional careers. And a band of activists in Missouri are helping the losers move.
Operation âPack Up and Get Outâ struck the offices of Rep. Russ Carnahan (D-MO) today. Carnahan is struggling to hold off Republican challenger Ed Martin, an original Tea Partier whose campaign has energized Missouriâs 3rd Congressional District.

âPack Up and Get Outâ delivered 300 moving boxes to the Congressmanâs offices in Brentwood, Missouri.</description>

  Think you can vote without a plan? Maybe you can. Or maybe youâll get too busy, traffic will be a mess, the weather will turn bad, or your boss will send you on a wild goose chase at 5:30. Without a voting plan, thereâs a chance that Missouri will be stuck with a clown like Russ Carnahan.
So letâs make a plan.</description>

      <description>A town in England has reduced traffic congestion, pollution, and accidents. One year after the experiment began, the townspeople gushed over the change in the people and the way they drive. One womanâs commute went from twenty minutes to five.
How did this happen?
The town did the opposite of what had always been done. Instead of adding more traffic lights or signs or spy cameras, they went the other direction.</description>

      <description>In 47BC, Julius Caesar assumed dictatorial power in Rome. He instituted âreformsâ that transformed the Republic into the Empire. In the process, he became a dictator. Romeâs decent into oblivion began. In 44BC, seeing the damage Caesarâs tyranny and reforms, three men removed Caesar from power by the method of the day.
History moves faster now than it did 2,000 years ago. A megalomaniacal leaders bent on fundamentally transforming a nation can do remarkable damage in the blink of an eye.</description>

Because of the energy and enthusiasm in the room, the quality of the calls was fantastic. Veteran callers said that the people they spoke to were more engaged and pleasant than on past nights. Thatâs because success and energy drives enthusiasm, which people respond to even over the phone.</description>

Totalitarian regimes despise beauty. They bury it in palaces where the rulers roam, their cancerous eyes raking over someoneâs masterpiece the way raw sewage pollutes a clear stream after a pipeâs failure.
Regimes, in their attempts to hoard beauty, bury it.

I was right.

      <description>For 100 years in America, government, business, and the education establishment built schools and laws about education. The purpose of these government schools and education laws was to produce compliant, unimaginative, order-taking automatons.
Donât believe me? Hereâs Woodrow Wilson, educator and president, speaking on the American plan for education:
 We want one class of persons to have a liberal education, and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class of necessity in every society, to forgo the privilege of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks.</description>

They stretch investorsâ dollars to the limit and hunt for more VC to make dreams come true. They want to create jobs and better lives for many.
Over drinks, these young capitalists talk about three things:
  Easier access to capital.</description>

      <description>For (at least) the past two nights, Glenn Beckâs program has been spell-bindingly depressing and eye-gougingly infuriating. Heâs chronicled the Obama administrationâs anti-Constitutional transfer of power and wealth from private Americans to other countries. Heâs shown that the administration has no concern over the 2010 election because it has no intention of obeying the laws passed by Congress.

For example, the newly appointed Consumer Protection Czar, a hard-line communist, Elizabeth Warren, is funded directly from the U.</description>

      <description>Leftist philosophies lead to despotism. Despotism appeals to some people because:
  They donât have to think.
  They wonât face consequences.
  Problems arise when the people who thought they didnât want to think decide to think for themselves. Traditionally, the despots either kill or incarcerate the thinkers.
Eventually, too many people think, the prisons overflow, and the people kill or incarcerate the despot.
Instead of living through this cycle of violence again, why donât we stop the despot now?</description>

      <description>On November 5, 1980, ABC News Nightline was devoted to the aftermath of the election. Ronald Reagan won 51-41 over incumbent Jimmy Carter. Republicans took the Senate and picked up 30+ seats in the house.
The YouTube clip below shows us only the beginning of the program. But itâs a great reminder of what lies ahead for movement conservatives. Well, what lies ahead IF we continue to focus on moving the conversation toward first principles and away from the class warfare and Balkanization that Democrats love so much.</description>

      <description>The venerable Jim Hoft (aka, Gateway Pundit) snapped this shot of the new sign at St. Louis Tea Party Coalition HQ on Hampton.

One year ago this week, weâd just finished a summer of street protests. ObamaCare had been delayed . . . twice. Cap and Trade had been put on hold. Many of us were getting ready to drive up to Quincy, Illinois, for the Midwestâs 9-12 Tea Party.</description>

      <description>Yes, there are three major Tea Party events on 9-12: Washington, Sacramento, and St. Louis. But if you canât see the Atlantic or the Pacific from your window, why donât you make the trip to the middle of the country, to the âGateway to Novemberâ Tea Party under the Arch?

Iâm hearing from groups in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Iowa, and many from Illinois and Kansas who CANNOT WAIT for the 9-12 &amp;ldquo;Gateway to November&amp;rdquo; Tea Party in St.</description>

      <description>Within hours of reports of a firebombing at Rep. Russ Carnahanâs (D-MO) campaign finance office last Tuesday, St. Louisâs leftist bloggers leapt to the cause. In what seems to have been a coordinated attack, Riverfront Times and several progressive blogs and web sites ascribed culpability for the crime to St. Louis Tea Partyers.Â At one point, Chad Garrison of RFT flatly stated that the suspect âfit the descriptionâ of a tea partyer, a statement he later attempted to soften by claiming that firebombing is âtoo saneâ a crime for Tea Partyers.</description>

      <description>Each day, more economists jump onto the Double-Dip bandwagon. Signs abound that the natural economic recovery that would normally follow a deep recession wonât happen. Instead, the economy is now saddled with so much debt, so many regulations, and such onerous new taxes that the Obama Administration tells us to be happy with 9.5 percent unemployment.

Barack Obama is an economic disaster of the first order.
So why all the pessimism?</description>

      <description>Barney Frank Comes Home to the Facts.
Remarkable. Is this is a true change in heart, a real wising-up, of one of Congress&amp;rsquo;s biggest Fannie and Freddie supporters? Or is Barney Frank playing some angle here.
Let&amp;rsquo;s hope it&amp;rsquo;s the former. The best thing for America would be an awakening among big government Democrats. Imagine if Frank became a deficit hawk and a Tenther!.</description>

      <description>I approached the Rennick Park Pavilion with a heavy heart for three reasons. At least three.
First, it was yet another night that I would not be home. And tomorrowâs first day of school. The last first day of school for my son, Patrick. I canât think of that without thinking about his first day of kindergartenâwhich seems like yesterdayâwhen he insisted on riding the bus. With his little backpack overflowing with supplies listed on a green sheet of paper (Rockwood-Green Pines-K), he stepped onto that bus in August of 1998.</description>

      <description>One of the most popular and most talked about movies of 1993 was Falling Down, starring Michael Douglas, Barbara Hershey, and Robert Duval.
Douglas played William âD-FENSâ Foster, an engineer at a defense contractor who has a really bad day. Some described the movie as âan ordinary man at war with the everyday world.â
Foster became an iconic anti-hero for the people who (stealing Bill Clintonâs line)worked hard and played by the rules, yet found themselves at the bottom of the heap in the post-Cold War era of 1993.</description>

   Grim Voter Mood Turns Grimmer  Underpinning the gloom: Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe the economy has yet to hit bottom, a sharply higher percentage than the 53% who felt that way in January.
Wow.Â I think thebarrage of terrible economic news this week has people realizing that you canât borrow your way out of a debt problem.
So far this fiscal year, the US has paid more in interest on its rapidly rising debt than itâs taken in from all corporate taxes.</description>

Today, Congress gave failing states and cities $26 billion in Chinese loans. More failed policies bolstered.
Today, the Federal Reserve Board reversed its plan to pay down the debt in order to put off economic downturn until after the election.
Today, the Fed announced that our future is bleak.
Today, we learned that the government probably overstated 2nd quarter economic growthâby almost double. (h/t Ed Morrissey)
Today, we learned that inventories increased because people and businesses arenât buying.</description>

      <description>Congressional Democrats plan to hold a special session in August to pass yet another $26 billion bailout for states. Specifically for states that have create welfare empires they can no longer sustain.
So responsible states now have to pay for irresponsible states at the point of a federal gun.
It looks like the Democrats want to completely bankrupt America before they lose power in January.
Of course, this also gives empty suits like Russ Carnahan an excuse not to debate their opponents, talk to constituents, or hold town halls.</description>

Now, the Federal Reserve Boardâs Open Market Committee (FOMC) is getting ready to announce that the economy is sicker than we thought.
 Although Fed policymakers still believe the basic trajectory of the economy remains one of moderate expansion, there may be more attention given to heightened dangers of a sharp slowdown.</description>

Imelda Marcos was the wife of Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos. Marcos was more a dictator than a president.Â Another parallel.Â In 1986, the Filipinos and the world had enough. Marcos was deposed and Imeldaâs extravagance exposed.
Imelda Marcosâs closet contained 2,700 pairs of shoes. Thatâs a different pair of shoes every day forÂ 7.</description>

By an overwhelming, unmistakable 71 percent, we said to the Obama Regime, âTake this bill and shove it.â
The overwhelming passage was a slap in the face to the Missouri Hospital Association and to BJC President Steven Lipstein who spent nearly $500,000 trying to convince their employees that the hospital chain profits trump the Constitution.Â Pathetic worms.</description>

In a preposterous letter to his employees, Lipstein attempts to argue that human beings have no right to say ânoâ to health insurance. As self-anointed overlord of our spending, Lipstein questions the very foundations of Americaâs guiding philosophy when he writes:
 Can a citizen decide not to buy health care services, and with that decision, not be required to buy health insurance?</description>

      <title>Shark-Jumping Anderson Cooper Style</title>

      <description>Just before her beatification, Shirley Sherrod jumped the shark.

On Thursday, CNNâs Anderson Cooper let the embattled former USDA director talk for an hour. Bad idea. It was bad for CNN, bad for viewers, and really bad for Sherrod, who lost her mind on the air. This is what she said:
 I think heâd [Andrew Breitbart would] like to get us stuck back in the times of slavery, Thatâs where I think heâd like to see all black people end up again.</description>

      <description>Have you noticed few people call Barack Obama âThe Oneâ anymore? âThe Golferâ or âThe Vacationerâ is more like it. Something less than One, by any measure.

Still, with each passing day and each new, permanent crisis, it seems like BO just ainât up to the job of President. Nothing new. When Jimmy Carterâs incompetence became obvious, the lefty press developed a theory that the job had simply grown too complex for one man.</description>

      <description>To no oneâs surprise, leftist idiots and hate-mongers like David Frum, Keith Olbermann, and the staff of CNN point their crooked, hostile fingers toward Andrew Breitbart as the cause of Shirley Sherrodâs pain. Thatâs like blaming Ron Howard for the problems on board Apollo 13.
What Breitbart and Big Government did regarding Ms. Sherrod was identical to what every television news program does every day of the week. They produced a news story based on information reasonably available to them.</description>

      <description>When the NAACPâs Ben Jealous fired a reckless volley at the Tea Party, he missed his marked and struck an innocent woman.
One week ago tonight, the news cycle was alive with the excitement of a heavyweight fight. The NAACPâs Ben Jealous needed to raise money and restore a sagging membership. He decided to pick a fight with the Tea Party.
On Monday, the NAACP leaked a resolution to the Kansas City Star that stated:</description>

For Alex to continue his video apostolate, he needs our help.
I just joined his network for $5 a month.Â I hope you will, too.Â Today.

      <description>Sometimes it is personal.

Beginning with a simple blog post in February 2009, the St. Louis Tea Party Coalition has attracted over 40,000 people to dozens of events and online crusades. The vast majority of these folks represent Americaâs highest ideals in character and citizenship. We are educated, polite, and patriotic. We are stand-up people who fix our own problems and earn our own livings. We are not perfect, of course, but we understand that no one else can live our lives for us.</description>

      <description>The NAACP has decided that itâs worth time to call 20 million American patriots âracistsâ for advancing liberty and economic opportunity.
At midnight, the St. Louis Tea Party Coalition sent a resolution condemning the NAACPâs bigotry and hatred to its Washington bureau.
The Tea Partyâs principles are simple and clear:
* Smaller federal government** Lower taxes** Fiscal responsibility** National defense** Federalism  Those are precisely the tools to lift all Americans out of poverty.</description>

      <description>What if: In January, a new Republican Congress is sworn in. First up on the agenda? A bi-partisan report stating that Congress must enact the most draconian tax increases and entitlement cuts in history or face total economic collapse.

Thatâs the scenario developing.
President Obama appointed a bi-partisan commission to make recommendations about the US governmentâs debt. The commission will not report out until after the November 2010 elections, but the leadersâRepublican Alan Simpson and Democrat Erskine Bowles&amp;ndash;have given some warning about what we can expect.</description>

      <description>Democrats are planning to punish the American people with draconian, destructive legislation during the lame duck session following Novemberâs election, according the Wall Street Journal.
 That&amp;rsquo;s why there have been signs in recent weeks that party leaders are planning an ambitious, lame-duck session to muscle through bills in December they don&amp;rsquo;t want to defend before November. Retiring or defeated members of Congress would then be able to vote for sweeping legislation without any fear of voter retaliation.</description>

      <description>When you give over most of your private time to a cause, you need some feedback. We got some from former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan on Friday: The Summer of the Angry Mob

Ms. Noonan reflected on the Townhall Revolt which began in St. Louis one year ago. Writes Noonan:
 When Rep. Russ Carnahan held a town hall meeting at a community college in Missouri on July 20, he tried patiently to explain that ObamaCare not only would be deficit-neutral, it would save money.</description>

      <description>Rasmussen Report has the latest numbers from the Missouri Senate race.
The poll does not include any mention of Republican candidate Chuck Purgason. Purgason seems to be enjoying something of a surge. Heâs doffed his toupee and traded the Bolo tie for a regular one. And Purgasonâs released a radio commercial in key areas around the state.
Rasmussen finds strong support for Roy Blunt among those who consider themselves tea partyers:</description>

      <description>Sometimes things just happen.
As Jim Durbin points out, last nightâs St. Louis Tea Party Night at the Ball Game was a total fluke. A mix-up left us with 46 tickets to last nightâs Cardinalâs game against Arizona. (Long story.) But this tea party thing that started over a year ago seems to generate its own publicity.

But the real story, to me, is what happened last night. Three incidents vindicated the shift toward more community building work, even if that work comes at the expense of big, boisterous rallies.</description>

      <description>Communist dictator Hugo Chavez has has stolen eleven oil rigs owned by the American company Helmerich and Payne. As Reuters points out, Chavez has now nationalized oil, telecommunications (including news), power, steel, and banking.
If youâre keeping score, Chavez leads Obama 5-3, as Obama so far has managed to seize only banking, automotive, and healthcare. But Obama has vowed a comeback.

 I&amp;rsquo;m doing it because I said I was going to do it and I think it&amp;rsquo;s the right thing to do. People should learn that lesson about me because next year when I start presenting some very difficult choices to the country, I hope some of these folks who are hollering about deficits and debt step-up because I&amp;rsquo;m calling their bluff.</description>

Existing home sales fell in May. As of this morning, economists expected a six percent increase.
Economists expect new home sales to be worse than existing home sales.
And economists expected home sales to fall off the table in July and for the remainder of 2010.</description>

I do.Â I am concerned that we keep repeating the same tactics to the same audiences until both the audience and the actors becomeÂ . . . well, bored.
When I read stories like this one, that GOP sentiment is at an all-time high, I worry that some on our side might decide they can go back to their regularly scheduled programming.</description>

      <description>You would think that the basement of the White House was gushing 60,000 barrels of oil a day, wouldnât you? After all, President Obamaâs entire response to the greatest ecological disaster of modern times has been empower Washington, DC.
The disasters are in the Gulf of Mexico, Mr. President, and in the latest Gallup and Rasmussen polls.
Politicians who worship at the alter of omnipotent government have no answers to problems outside of government.</description>

In less than twenty-four hours, the left has demonstrated its incapacity for civilized living by physically assaulting a college student, then exclaiming the virtues of physical assaults on reporters.
Background
A Democrat member of Congress assaulted a college student. The assault, shown on two video angles, was unprovoked (unless asking a simple, closed question is now cause for violence) andcontinuing long past the point at which the victim said stop.</description>

      <description>No, Iâm not a war monger. But peace is not the absence of war. Itâs the presence of peace.

If you live in Israel, you are not at peace. You are at war. War against a massive body of people who want to destroy you before they move on to destroy Christendom. If Christendom doesnât destroy itself first.
So letâs all thank Israel for standing tall on the front lines of this epic battle between good and evil.</description>

      <description>A Washington Post/ABC News poll shows a major shift in sentiment toward (against?) the tea party movement.
I would not challenge the accuracy of the results which show the tea partyâs popularity waning among Southerners and people 18 to 29. In fact, the poll shows that a full 50 percent of Americans now have a negative view of the tea party.
Sure, there may have been some chicanery with the questions to skew the results.</description>

      <description>Thirty-two years ago this month, the modern conservative movement was born.
The movement began with a local issue in a single state.Â Howard Jarvis of California succeeded in rolling back that stateâs property taxes. Voters ignored Governor Jerry Brownâs apocalyptic predictions and captured the imaginations of a nation. After decades of government growth, the people of Americaâs largest state said, âEnough!â

As economist Stephen Moore wrote on cato.org a dozen years ago:</description>

      <description>This is disturbing. A St. Louis area âChristianâ church, Parkway United Church of Christ, on N. Ballas is promoting Islam on its sign.

This photo was snapped today, June 7, 2010 by Marcia Behr of St. Louis.
While itâs understandable that a Christian church would treat Muslims as children of God, we are obliged to do so in the context of their prayerful conversion to Christ. Tolerance does not require submission.</description>

      <description>Supporting Obama now seen as . . . naive nostalgia.
     It is an irony of Obama&amp;rsquo;s presidency - which came into being because he was the unBush - that it shares some of the worst traits of his predecessor&amp;rsquo;s administration. Among these are insularity and a blinkered arrogance.
    Obama has never been wracked by self-doubt and he is unusually self-contained for a politician.</description>

      <description>This fantastic quote comes from Nasim Taleb (author of The Black Swan) via Timothy Ferriss (author of _The Four-Hour Work WeekI). _
 Robustness is when you care more about the few who like your work than the multitude who hates it (artists); fragility is when you care more about the few who hate your work than the multitude who loves it (politicians).
 Dazzling, really.Â Imagine what we could accomplish by ignoring the haters.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine explained an interesting theory to me the other day.
âThe natural tendency of the universe is to level everything,â he said. âThis entropic force leads us to just âgo with the flow.â But what makes us humanâwhat built civilization and made man nobleâwas when we finally resisted entropy. When we built a levy to keep our village from flooding, or when we learned to lure and trap, then farm, animals instead of tracking them.</description>

      <description>Seth Godin is one of my favorite writers, thinkers, marketers, and presenters. Everything he writes is worth your time reading. Two of his books stand out for me. One is Tribes, because Tribes describes the whole Tea Party experience perfectly. And he wrote it a year before the Tea Party things started.
Right now, though, my other favorite Godin book serves as a question and a guide for the Tea Party movement.</description>

I feel it, too. Financially, emotionally, and chronologically.
While my book Zen Conservatism wonât fix all your problems, it will help you deal with whatâs going on in America a little better.
From now until Fatherâs Day, Iâm giving you $4.95 off the cover price, so you can get the book for just $10 plus shipping.</description>

      <description>A few weeks back, the Christian Science Monitor asked me to write an op-ed. The subject was, âIf the Tea Party ran America, how would things change; and why do you think youâll win?â
The call was my opportunity to break from the easy, unassailable position that things are bad and getting worse. It meant coming up with a solution or two.Â And solutions already find disagreement somewhere.
For over a year Iâve said that the Tea Party movement, begun out of anger, must shift its energy over time from anger to solutions.</description>

      <description>It took almost three years of Jimmy Carterâs dangerously naive worldview before the world rushed in. By ârushed in,â I mean the Soviet Union rushed into Afghanistan, Iranian radicals rushed into the US Embassy in Tehran, and Cuban-backed communists rushed into every Central and South American country they could.
These aggressions resulted from a world perception that Jimmy Carter was unwilling to use Americaâs arsenal for good. Additionally, following Vietnam and observing American culture, the world surmised that:</description>

As Peggy Noonan pointed out in a painfully honest Wall Street Journal column on May 28, we know now that Barack Obama is an empty suit, a child playing grown-up.
 I wonder if the president knows what a disaster this is not only for him but for his political assumptions.</description>

      <description>Dana Loesch and 24th State have revealed the ring of corruption that extends from St. Louis bloggers and local St. Louis leftist rag, through SEIU, to Media Matters and Huffington Post.
An additional crook in this den of thieves is Democrat Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Casey has introduced yet another bailout package. This time, the bailout is intended to repay corrupt unions like SEIU and AFL-CIO for bankrupting their membersâ retirements by bribing the media and politicians.</description>

      <description>Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) wants you to pay $165 billion to bail out organized crimeunions. Actually, the bill heading toward taxpayers is unlimited and could reach into the trillions:
 Although right now taxpayers could possibly be on the hook for $165 billion, the liability could essentially be unlimited because these pensions have to be paid out until the workers die.
 Remember why we took to the streets for the first Tea Party Protests in 2009?</description>

Celesteâs fellow students and, apparently, a teacher named Debra Blessman are bullying and abusing the girl.Â Celesteâs sin? Conservatism.
Bob McCarty tells the story better than I can.Â Dana Loesch has been all over this story.Â Thereâs a facebook page dedicated to supporting Celeste, which everyone should like, even those of us who hate facebook.
I should point out that, to date, the schoolâs administrators are standing behind the abusive teach, Blessman, who calls Celeste a âtea baggerâ and encourages the students to mock the girl.</description>

      <description>Interesting. Mounting evidence suggests [the White House may have been complicit](If so, even Democrats in Congress would be forced to open impeachment investigations) in SEIUâs terrorism (as defined by U.S. Patriot Act) of a bankerâs teenage son.

Quit the SEIU. No decent person would belong to an organization that openly, and with the federal governmentâs approval, uses terrorism to get its way.
Quit the DC Metro Police Force. The President is using you to promote domestic terrorism.</description>

The Dow:Â The Dow trades within a range of 1,000 points with a daily average closing of 8,500.
Grade:Â D. The average would be a pain to figure out, but it looks like it was closer 9800.

Roubiniâs comments came in response to a 376 point drop in the Dow Industrials. Nasdaq and S&amp;amp;P 500 were off significantly as well.</description>

      <description>Whether youâre the party darling or the federal office holder, 2010 is shaping up to be yourÂ last year in politics.
In Kentucky, Tea Party Republican, Rand Paul, opened a can of whoop-ass on Republican party favorite, Trey Grayson. No single race proves the strength or impact of the Tea Party, but races like Paulâs demonstrate that the right candidate with the right campaign team with the strong backing of the Tea Party and 9-12 Project can blow away the party candidate.</description>

      <description>The final poll before Tuesdayâs special election to fill Jack Murthaâs unexpired seat in the U.S. House shows that Republican Tim Burns is neck and neck with Democrat and pork barrel specialist Mark Critz.

      <description>I canât tell you the date of our last sandlot football game. We didnât commemorate it or mark with a special ceremony. We probably didnât even know it would be our last game together.

After school, the kids would come to my house. Our next door neighbors, the Nahers, had a double lot, and Mrs. Naher was a former professional womenâs baseball player. She loved sports and kids and let us tear up the the lawn they manicured all summer by playing sandlot football in the fall and winter.</description>

      <description>In Tennessee and Arizona, insurance exchanges created under ObamaCare are barred from covering abortions. Pro-life groups claim this trend will continue as more states realize that the bill passed earlier this year allows states to block abortion coverage by private exchanges. (Missouriâs legislature sent a similar measure to Gov. Jay Nixon.)

Pro-abortion members of Congress are incensed, according to the Associated Press and Fox News:
 &amp;ldquo;Implementation of this reform should be about increasing access to health care and increasing choices, not taking them away,&amp;rdquo; said Sen.</description>

      <description>Unbelievable! Scientists have discovered that the huge, glowing fireball in the sky may affect Earthâs temperature.
The latest evidence comes from . . . the Moon.
Back when we used to send astronauts to the Moon, we placed some temperature sensors on the Moonâs surface. We still monitor those sensors.
Guess what they show. Yep, youâre right! As temperatures rose on Earth, temperatures rose on the Moon.

Watts Up With That has all the details.</description>

      <description>I realize that most people aren&amp;rsquo;t reading political insider blogs at 4:30 in the morning. But something in this story bothers me:
 But there&amp;rsquo;s also one big reason why the Democrats may just pull it out- and why Republicans may not have as big an election year as we&amp;rsquo;re anticipating. And that&amp;rsquo;s because only 26% of voters in the district have a favorable opinion of Congressional Republicans, with 56% seeing them unfavorably.</description>

      <description>For the record, I do not apologize for focusing on the most important battles facing self-government since the American Revolution.

Earlier this week, McGraw Milhaven of 550 KTRS criticized Tea Partyers for not opposing Missouri legislation, introduced by and championed by Republicans, that will force insurance companies to cover treatment for children diagnosed with Autism and associated conditions.Â (I personally oppose this legislation, by the way.)
Before that, a few Tea Partyers criticized me and others on facebookÂ for not doing âenoughâ to support the Missouri Healthcare Free Choice act, which recently passed both the House and the Senate.</description>

      <description>I had a small revelation yesterday: there are two paths to focus.
One path requires constant vigilance against distraction. This path also demands great awareness of many things, knowledge, and outlandish tenacity. This is the path we recognize as heroic.
The other path gets less notice, less acclaim. Those how follow this other path to focus donât seem to try hard. These are the ânaturals.â Things seem to come easy for them.</description>

Anger will have to wait for a future post. This one is about happiness. So let me ask: would you do something that took less than a minute if that something would make you happier?
Martin Seligman at University of Pennsylvaniaâs school of Positive Psychology has broken down happiness in more scientifically measurable components:

On Saturday, a crowd of several hundred 9-12 Project and Tea Party organizers heard Ryun explain why itâs time to move beyond the rallies at the American Majority Post-Party Summit in Kansas City. I have mentioned this before, and it seems to bother many people. I understand why.

The rally was the animating function of the Tea Party movement.</description>

The Obama Justice Department is quietly investigating the lawyers associated with the John Adams Project who may have violated a number of laws in place to protect our covert operatives and their families. But so far, with few exceptions, the media and their friends on Capitol Hill havenât found this case nearly as interesting as Valerie Plame.</description>

In human relations, there is a fixed ratio between leaders and those they lead.
The people trust leaders as much as the leader trusts the people.
In my lifetime, no leader ever trusted me as much as Ronald Reagan.
And I have trusted no leader as much as I trusted him.

Our goal is affect the outcome of the 2010 elections. That has not changed since our first tea party in Febuary 2009 with itâs tag line âRepeal the pork . . . or retire!â
They didnât fix the fiscal problems. We owe it to ourselves to retire them.

At Tea Party marches and rallies, we are surrounded by others who understand and cherish liberty. We know the horrors that occur when a government loses accountability to and, yes, fear of the people they govern. Such regimes become murderous, intolerant, and repressive.</description>

      <description>No, General Motors did not pay back its debt to taxpayers. Edward Whitacre is a liar. Instead, Whitacre paid the Visa bill with his MasterCard.Â But both cards were issued by the same bank.Â So you, the banker, are still on the hook for the full amount.
Now we know why Obama hand-picked Ed Whitacre to âleadâ GM: Whitacre will do the presidentâs bidding.

      <description>WSJ.com Alert:
 S&amp;amp;P downgrades Spain to &amp;lsquo;AA&amp;rsquo; with a negative outlook, saying the country is likely to have an extended period of subdued economic growth.
 Markets react: DJIA plummets from +23 to â22 in seconds after S&amp;amp;P drops Spainâs debt rating. And the sovereign debt nightmare is only beginning. The UK is next. But the USA borrows more money faster than anyone, and Socio-History blog ainât happy:
  As I pointed out yesterday, US debt threatens to end the economic stabilization.</description>

      <description>As I waited to appear on Larry Kudlowâs show last Friday, I heard Larry announce over and over again that heâs sick of hearing about Greeceâs problems. Greece isnât America. The U.S. economy is booming, and Greece canât hurt it.
I didnât tell Larry, but I think he was wrong.
Greeceâs problems will hurt the American economy because Greeceâs problems foreshadow a far more dangerous crash headed to America.
Markets are people.</description>

      <description>I heard from my son, Jack, tonight for the first time since he left for Navy boot camp on April 14.
He is doing well. He survived the first week. Heâs been declared fit for full duty. Heâs learned to fold things very compactly, to recite the General Orders to the Sentry on command, and to identify his Chain of Command through the President of the United States.
If boot camp hasnât changed, week two is worse that week one, but I didnât tell him that.</description>

      <description>I once thought that focus meant you never got distracted. I was wrong.
A person with a powerful focusing ability gets as distracted as the next guy. The difference is that the Focus Master has learned to recognize distraction and gently guide his thoughts or actions back to the intended task at hand.
That simple skill is rare and remarkably powerful. Pay attention to every word of this two-step process:</description>

It was probably the last day that he and I will share a mailing address.Â In a few days, Iâll get a postcard containing a new address at RTC Great Lakes. It will be written in his own hand. He will miss home when he writes it.
I hope Iâm not revealing too much.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow, Tuesday, April 6, is Election Day in St. Louis County. In some places, especially throughout South County, the only measure on the ballot is Proposition A: a sales tax increase.
Prop Aâs backersâprincipally County Exec Charlie Dooley and Chesterfield Mayor John Nationsâclaim this tax increase of up to $650 per family will allow Metro to grow. You know otherwise.
* Dooley and Nations cannot point to a specific plan. They point to four.</description>

We sat at a hi-top table for four at John D. McGurk&amp;rsquo;s Irish (duh) Pub in South St. Louis. Cold filled my being down to the soul. I&amp;rsquo;d been outside in the rain for the better part of two days. My favorite sport coat, soaked, lay in the back seat of my Jeep. My shirts clung to my shivering skin. My penny loafers made the sound of swishing mouth-rinse with every step.</description>

      <description>WASHINGTON, DC: The White House unveiled a new strategy to lower the nationâs unemployment rate, currently standing at 10 percent.
In his weekly radio address Saturday, the President announced that he will use remaining funds from the failed Stimulus bill to take advantage of little known variable in the unemployment rate factor: âdiscouraged workers.â
Pointing out that âdiscouragedâ workers are excluded from the unemployment calculation, the President explained that the government will encourage the unemployed to simply give up hopes for finding work.</description>

      <description>WASHINGTON, DC &amp;ndash; Saying, âThe Senate relies on dingy-skinned white men, especially ones without a cracker dialect,â President Barack Obama accepted Senator Harry Reidâs (D-NV) apology for words Reid used in private in 2008.
According to the forthcoming book, âGame Changing,â Reid described Obama a âlight-skinnedâ black man âwith no Negro dialect . . . unless he wanted to have oneâ during the 2008 presidential election.
In his apology, Reid said, âI deeply regret using such a poor choice of words, but itâs mighty white of the President to accept my sincere apology.</description>

    I began this book in December 2008, just after the election.Â My goal was to produce a book that would inspire people to restore our republic.Â At the time, conservatives were disheartened, dismayed, and distracted.
Then the Tea Party movement began, and I had to put my book project on hold. But thanks to your work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to return to my project.</description>

      <title>Does Missouri Need Another State Commission?</title>

      <description>Usually, Iâm against any government adding anything to its list of functions. But our friend Carl Bearden points out a novel and needed commission proposed by Missouri State Senator Gary Nodler. If enacted, Senate Bill No. 587 would require Missouri to establish a 10th Amendment Commission.
Hereâs language directly from the proposed bill:
 The commission shall examine actions of the federal government toward the state, and refer cases to the attorney general when the federal government takes steps that require the state or a state officer to enact or enforce a provision of federal law that lies outside Congress&amp;rsquo;s enumerated powers and intrudes on the sovereignty reserved to the states by the tenth amendment to the United States Constitution.</description>

He called the Tea Party just to vent and to see if itâs just him.
Recently, John had called Senator Kit Bondâs (R-MO) office in Washington. He wanted to know whether stories that Bond had signed off a $659 million earmark for soy bean farmers were true.</description>

      <description>The most disappointing thing about leaving the military is that it usually means leaving the last bastion of leadership in America. If you open your own business or freelance, you probably donât notice the cowardly bastards populating corner offices in most American enterprises. Youâd puke, as Holden Caulfield might say.

You wish you could just yell âSTOP!â âand someone would listen.

 Americans have more publishing freedom than any people in world history. We can choose what to read; what to teach our children; how, where and when to write; which causes to give money to; or even whether we want to get involved with the news at all.</description>

      <description>As a candidate, Barack Obama swore he would throw open the activities of government to light of public scrutiny. In his inauguration, he swore to disclose everything. As President, he has instituted strict rules of secrecy on White House actions&amp;ndash;except those of his predecessors.
Now, Newsweek&amp;rsquo;s Michael Isikoff, no friend of the right, notices the incongruity between Obama&amp;rsquo;s promises and his actual openess.
He finds that Obama&amp;rsquo;s openess executive order contains loopholes that the media have ignored until now.</description>

 That would be good news, but only if a) it&amp;rsquo;s true, and b) 148,000 more people found jobs than lost them last month.

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know why, then you&amp;rsquo;re reading the wrong blog.
The New Agenda is keeping tabs on sponsors of David Letterman&amp;rsquo;s show. I have already told T-Mobile that I will cancel may $120 month service (paying the penalty) if they don&amp;rsquo;t stop advertising on The Late Show by July 15.
Top names on the boycott list:
 * Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson * T-Mobile * Ford * Nissan/Infiniti * Toyota/Lexus * Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble * Citigroup (which should be out of business, anyway) * Chase (JPMC) * The Gap (plus Old Navy and Banana Republic) * Wyeth * Saturn * Hotels.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s not a party.
It&amp;rsquo;s not a day off work.
It&amp;rsquo;s a memorial to those who placed freedom, liberty, and dignity above the tiny distractions of life. We memorialize the moments of our heroes&amp;rsquo; lives&amp;ndash;moments that defined their legacy in God&amp;rsquo;s book.
They raised their hands and swore to defend their country and Constitution. They were so young, then. I saw a young Marine, yesterday, at his girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s high school graduation.</description>

      <description>_While the Tea Party movement was and remains non-partisan, the dangers to freedom posed by this man, Barack Obama, are too serious to protect his name with euphemisms. The Tea Party movement is the only active resistance to this administration&amp;rsquo;s dictatorial seizure of power. _
Today, a government official leaked plans for a permanent government takeover of General Motors. On the heels of the administration&amp;rsquo;s repeal of contract law and elimination of 200 years of bankruptcy case law, this could signal the end of private ownership of manufacturing companies in America.</description>

The book&amp;rsquo;s first story involves a Greek statue scientifically proven to be authentic . . . except that every human expert who sees it instinctively knows something&amp;rsquo;s wrong. Turns out, of course, that the humans are right and science is wrong. The statue was a fraud.
When I first heard the story of the AF1 fly-over of New York City that created panic on Wall Street, I immediately, instinctively knew that it the publicity photo story was wrong.</description>

      <description>One single legislative act will stop government overspending in its tracks.
In 1978, Representative Jack Kemp (R-NY) proposed legislation (which had no chance of passage in Tip O&amp;rsquo;Neill&amp;rsquo;s Democrat Congress) designed to stop the government from defrauding investors with inflation: bond indexing. The measure would have the additional value of discouraging government spending.
Ronald Reagan and Milton Friedman endorsed Kemp&amp;rsquo;s proposal. Let&amp;rsquo;s dust off this bill and push it through Congress as a memorial to Jack Kemp.</description>

      <description>In the battle between conservatives and statists, a fundamental difference seems to lie in the meaning of a concept found in the Declaration of Independence:
 Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed[.]
 The dispute is how men convey consensual powers to their government.
Conservatives believe that governmental power is conveyed exclusively through the Constitution; statists believe power is conveyed through elections.</description>

      <description>The statists are moving faster through the Constitution than Hitler moved through France. Today, Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to advance a bill to socialize medicine without debate.
 House Democrats went on record again in favor of advancing the legislation while allowing only limited debate, which would hobble the ability of Republicans to wrest concessions on one of Obama&amp;rsquo;s top domestic priorities.

Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp wanted to index everything, especially Treasury notes and taxes. By &amp;ldquo;indexing,&amp;rdquo; we mean tying rates (interest and tax) to the inflation rate. Calls for indexing subsided after Reagan and Volcker did what Ford and Carter could not: whip inflation now.
With a $2 trillion deficit this year and multi-trillion deficits projected as far as the eye can see, inflation will return to ravage the American consumer.</description>

      <description>This is my last post on Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View, at least for some time. My work for the St. Louis Tea Party movement is very important to me and, in my opinion, to you. Our government is moving quickly to obliterate all vestiges of the free market republic that America once was. With the Republican party in disarray and the Democrat party in the hands of statist despots, the tea partiers are the only thing standing between liberty and tyranny.</description>

      <description>The American Nazis are holding a rally on the Arch grounds at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, April 18. The Anti-Defamation League is sponsoring a counter-rally in Forest Park at the same time.
I will be at Forest Park.
So I have some strong disagreements with some of the sponsoring organizations of the counter-rally. Big deal. If the point of the counter-rally is to oppose Nazism, then I can easily look past those differences for a couple of hours.</description>

      <description>Barack Obamaâs shameful and anti-American behavior this past weekend in Europe deserves the kind of scorn reserved for degenerate traitors like Benedict Arnold, the Rosenbergs, and Alger Hiss.
On Thursday in London, the President of the United States transferred Americaâs economic sovereignty from we, the people, to a small group of European central bankers.
In the words of former Clinton staffer Dick Morris, Obama ânullified the Declaration of Independence.â Specifically, Obama signed an agreement to create the Financial Stability Board comprised of European central banks and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.</description>

      <description>The Obama administration has no intention of relinquishing dictatorial control of the banks according to financial expert Stuart Varney.Â  The government wants to control the banks, just as it now controls GM and Chrysler, and will surely control the health industry in the not-too-distant future. Keeping them TARP-stuffed is the key to control. And for this intensely political president, mere influence is not enough. The White House wants to tell &amp;lsquo;em what to do.</description>

Currently, every family of 3 is obliged to pay over $118,000 in the next 30 years. That&amp;rsquo;s a house payment with a variable-rate. In other words, the government has done exactly what helped cause the mess for individuals by borrowing beyond its means at a teaser rate of 0.8 percent. That Teaser Rate Will Skyrocket</description>

      <description>Barack Obama has asserted his dictatorial powers by firing GM CEO Rick Waggoner. The firing of a companyâs chief executive by a US president should send chills down the spine of every American. This is totalitarianism defined.
While Hennessyâs View has been critical of Waggonerâs leadership at GM, we oppose illegal and unconstitutional dictatorial powers in the hands of any US president.
Nothing in the Constitution permits a sitting president to direct a private company.</description>

Tax Cuts: More voters than ever now say tax cuts help the economy. Over 60 percent now agree with JFK, Reagan, Bush, and the undeniable facts of economic history: cutting taxes increases GDP and personal wealth.  A separate survey releasedÂ earlier todayÂ found that 66% of voters think the president is likely to raise taxes on those who make less than $250,000 per year.</description>

From The Weekly Standard:
 Some of the detainees, deemed non-threatening, may be released into the United States as free men, Blair confirmed.
That would happen when they can&amp;rsquo;t be returned to their home countries, because the governments either won&amp;rsquo;t take them or the U.S. fears they will be abused or tortured.
Blair said the former prisoners would have [to] get some sort of assistance to start their new lives in the United States.</description>

      <description>The parish or congregation thatâs most generous at the collection basket is not necessarily the church that sends the most souls to heaven. Nor is the best attended church the one that saves the most. Yet the purpose of every Christian congregation is to put souls through the Pearly Gates, not to put butts in pews.
Michael Steeleâs GOP made much, last week, of the fact that his party raised more money in February than did the Democrats.</description>

      <description>I try not to say or write what I really thing about our President. It isn&amp;rsquo;t Christian.
But when we were dating, my wife gave me the best advice I&amp;rsquo;ve ever received: If you really want to cut someone down, say at least one good thing about them, and make it sound sincere. For that reason, I keep in mind that Barack Obama is a fantastic communicator.
Until tonight.
He sucked.</description>

      <description>I wonât write much: Iâm too angry.
He has not answered a single question without blaming Bush and the Republicans. Heâs blamed the Republicans for the Democrat Congress!
He claims that âno one disputesâ his prediction of the fastest economic growth in the American&amp;rsquo; history beginning THIS YEAR! Of course no one disputes it! Rational people donât argue with insanity.
Finally, heâs a Marxist bent on destroying American liberty! We donât need to know anything else.</description>

Before Obama destroys your kidsâ minds in his âletâs kill all the productive peopleâ Nazi-Marxist youth camps, make them read the seminal work on conservatism by Mark Levin.
Having authored a Conservative Manifesto myself, I am confident that this book is the definitive thought on conservatism.
If youâre new to politics and activism, you need this primer. It will arm you with the verbal and intellectual ammunition you need send the scrawny rabble rouser we call a president back to the slimy rock he crawled out from under.</description>

      <description>The House, which is unabashedly authoritarian, has passed the GIVE Act, requiring national-socialist indoctrination for your children.
Thatâs right. Obama is going to turn your kids into spies working against you and your elderly parents. Why? Because Marxists like Obama hate liberty. Liberty is their enemy. And you support liberty, then you&amp;rsquo;re the enemy, too.
Now, before you say Iâm reaching, read the language.
Think Obamaâs goal isnât a totalitarian, Marxist state?</description>

      <description>Today, leftist Congressman Barney Frank (D-MA) called Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia a &amp;ldquo;homophobe.&amp;rdquo; But this isn&amp;rsquo;t about gay rights or homophobia. It&amp;rsquo;s about the many, many people like Barney Frank who believe that everything they don&amp;rsquo;t like about life is someone&amp;rsquo;s fault. It&amp;rsquo;s about the entitlement pandemic currently ravaging common sense.

      <description>I did not watch America&amp;rsquo;s Toxic Asset on 60 Minutes for the same reason I&amp;rsquo;ve never read &amp;ldquo;Mein Kampf.&amp;rdquo; Some people&amp;rsquo;s words do not deserve my ear.
I find it interesting, though, that Mr. Obama&amp;rsquo;s 90 minute interview on a program called &amp;ldquo;60 Minutes&amp;rdquo; so eerily parallels his budget: he consumed 150 percent of what was available.
To those who watched our dictator-in-the-making, I ask a question, the answer to which should demonstrate that watching the propaganda piece was useles: what did you learn that you didn&amp;rsquo;t know before?</description>

      <description>The Missouri Information Analysis Center produced a report for Jay Nixon which was leaked by Missouri law enforcement officers. Perhaps the motivation for leaking was the chilling content of the report. The report classifies almost every conservative as a terrorist or potential terrorist. It encourages law enforcement to profile me and everyone like me.
Any of these &amp;ldquo;warning signs&amp;rdquo; could cause Missouri police officers to pull you over and handle you as a suspected terrorist: * A Pro-Life bumper sticker * A Ron Paul bumper sticker * A flag with &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t Tread on Me&amp;rdquo; * Anti-Tax bumper stickers * Owning a gun * Supporting any 3rd party in any election * Belonging to conservative organizations</description>

 Hello, it&amp;rsquo;s Lloyd Marcus, one of the spokespersons for the Our Country Deserves Better Committee. I&amp;rsquo;m active with this organization because I believe that Conservatism is compassionate and is the true path to achieving the AmericanDream. Liberalism weakens the human spirit by encouraging people to view themselves as victims.
 Besides political activism, my other great passion in life is as a singer, because that&amp;rsquo;s one of the things God gave me the greatest passion to pursue.</description>

      <description>The speed with which Barack Obama has seizedâis seizingâprivate enterprise amazes even radical conservatives like me. Quite honestly, I am losing confidence in anyoneâs ability to stop him from making the United States into a hip version of the old Soviet Union. In his first 100, Barack Obama will have transformed the US government, completely erasing Ronald Reaganâs presidencyâas it the 80s never happened.
The New York Times piece gives a great example.</description>

      <description>The latest Rasmussen poll has bad news for Obama, good news for those of us whoâve been warning America how dangerous he is.
Highlights:
The number of people calling Obama âextremely liberalâ has jumped 16 percentage points since the inauguration
Those expecting government spending to skyrocket is up to 72 percent from 54 percent on election day
Overall approval has fallen to +4 percent from +30 percent just after the inauguration</description>

      <description>The new Secretary of Homeland Security has replaced the word &amp;ldquo;terrorism&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;man-caused disasters.&amp;rdquo;
 I did not use the word &amp;ldquo;terrorism,&amp;rdquo; I referred to &amp;ldquo;man-caused&amp;rdquo; disasters. That is perhaps only a nuance, but it demonstrates that we want to move away from the politics of fear toward a policy of being prepared for all risks that can occur.
 I assume that appointing an idiot like Napolitano to the cabinet qualifies as a man-cause disaster.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Absurd&amp;rdquo; is the perfect word.
Obama personifies absurdity. Take this headline for example:
Obama Seeks to Lower Expectations (WSJ, 2/19/2009)
Trust me, Mr. President; my expectations of you could not get any lower.
Or this:
House Passes Tax on Wall St. Bonuses (WSJ, 2/19/2009)
The first Bill of Attainder in a century will sail through the courts because there are very few judges or justices who know Article I from Timbuktu.</description>

Thatâs America today. In the leadership vacuum created when the left eviscerated George W. Bush in 2006, Americaâs precarious imbalance seems improbable. Impossible.
Perhaps it is.
Likely it is.

 The leader of the nation&amp;rsquo;s largest veterans organization says he is &amp;ldquo;deeply disappointed and concerned&amp;rdquo; after a meeting with President Obama today to discuss a proposal to force private insurance companies to pay for the treatment of military veterans who have suffered service-connected disabilities and injuries. The Obama administration recently revealed a plan to require private insurance carriers to reimburse the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in such cases.</description>

THE MAGAZINE&amp;rsquo;S CREDENDA
Among our convictions: 1. It is the job of centralized government (in peacetime) to protect its citizens&amp;rsquo; lives, liberty and property. All other activities of government tend to diminish freedom and hamper progress. The growth of government(the dominant social feature of this century) must be fought relentlessly. In this great social conflict of the era, we are, without reservations, on the libertarian side. 2. The profound crisis of our era is, in essence, the conflict between the Social Engineers, who seek to adjust mankind to conform with scientific utopias, and the disciples of Truth, who defend the organic moral order.</description>

      <description>Rasmussen&amp;rsquo;s daily Presidential Approval Tracking numbers continue to show that Obama has lost more support in his first 50 days than any president since polling began.

Among the many factors contributing to Obama&amp;rsquo;s falling popularity, in my view, is his scattershot approach to the economy, inability to recruit and retain talent, and strong leftward lurch since taking office.
Americans do not want socialism. I hear over and over from disenchanted Obama voters that they didn&amp;rsquo;t believe he was a leftist as some on the right made him out to be during the campaign.</description>

The Tea Party is a grassroots movement that will overthrow Congress in a ballot box revolution in 2010. It gives voice to the silenced conservatives who have been told âshut up and pay your taxesâ by administrations and Congresses R and D.

      <description>Tonight on &amp;ldquo;The O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Factor,&amp;rdquo; liberal journalist Juan Williams sided with O&amp;rsquo;Reilly and Bernard Goldberg in ripping the left-wing smear machine.
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s real, and I&amp;rsquo;m a victim of it. I have the scars to prove it,&amp;rdquo; Williams told O&amp;rsquo;Reilly.
The left-wing smear machine includes The New York Times, Daily Kos, and others. As Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s forthcoming book, &amp;ldquo;A Slobbering Love Affair,&amp;rdquo; points out, this smear machine is a loosely but skillfully orchestrated consortium of radical, anti-American organizations that seeks, not just win at the polls, but to eliminate conservatism and Constitutional government.</description>

      <description>The Freedom of Choice Act, the most sweeping suppression of religious dissent ever considered in the United States, is poised to pass in Congress. This legislation will put the U. S. government on a collision course with the Catholic church that could fundamentally alter the relationship of the government to religions forever.
The Freedom of Choice Act would make it a crime for a hospital, nurse, doctor, or technician to refuse to take part in abortions.</description>

      <description>Cafe Press has dozens of shirts, stickers, and mugs that let you tell the world you belong to the Tea Party Movement.
The lefties proudly wear their Che t-shirts and those idiotic coexist bumper stickers. Conservatives shy away from Public Displays of Protest.
NO LONGER!
While we&amp;rsquo;re brewing up some St. Louis-flavored Tea Party logos, grab the generics now. You&amp;rsquo;re kids will thank you some day.

      <title>Post-Dispatch Out of Touch (no matter what Eric Mink says)</title>

      <description>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch was once a powerful, respected cornerstone of the Pulitzer publishing company. Today, it&amp;rsquo;s little more than a community newspaper. Some near-tomorrow, it will go the way of Rocky Mountain News. Its demise can be traced in large measure to the arrogance of its editorial board.
Take Eric Mink. This is a man who rose through the organization by leveling unfair, nearly libelous attacks on anyone who deviated from Mink&amp;rsquo;s party line.</description>

      <description>When Republican Congressmen and -women are more conservative than the party chair, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a new party chair.Â Micheal Steele took his seat and immediately alienated conservatives, the backbone of the Republican party. By attacking Rush Limbaugh, Steele attacked one of the few people in the US with the courage to speak the truth.Â For five years, Democrats have prayed &amp;ndash; PRAYED &amp;ndash; that Al Qaeda in Iraq would defeat the US Military.</description>

Arctic Sea Ice Extend Growing
Not too long ago, Al Gore told German school kids that the North Pole, Santa, Polar Bears, and puppies would all be dead and rotting hunks of diseased fleshed in barren, desserts that were once the Arctic Sea by the time they entered high school. Turns out that the Arctic Sea Ice Extent for 2007-08 and 2008-09 is pretty much in the average for entire history of measured sea ice extent (1979 to present).</description>

      <description>The economy was just fine before you people elected a Democrat Congress.Â The Democrat party has controlled government&amp;rsquo;s taxing and spending policy since January 2007.Â In that time, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi, now joined by Barack Obama, have presided over the greatest market and economic crash since the Great Depression.
Everything They Do Makes Things Worse
The US and world economies have been in rapid decline since Pelosi picked up the Speaker&amp;rsquo;s gavel.</description>

 I hope you don&amp;rsquo;t mind me bugging you about this but I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to find a group to get involved in that understands that some people have principles and they don&amp;rsquo;t believe government is the answer to the mess we are in.

Barack Obama is now less popular than George W. Bush at the same point in their respective presidencies according to Rasmussen.
The poll also indicates that deficits are more important to Americans than anything else. This could be the result of theTea Party movement which drew more than 30,000 people in 40 cities to take to the streets over the weekend.
At this rate, Obama&amp;rsquo;s overall popularity will turn net negative this time next week.</description>

      <description>The immediacy of our challenge in defending the Republic against Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s socialist,one-world ambitions reached new levels over the weekend.
UPDATE: The eminent domain story appears to be a hoax. My apologies. I found it on several blogs that are generally reliable, so I assume the hoaxter is good at his craft
Eminent Domain Rights to China*

      <description>Dangerous Thoughts Standing in the Wings
_Why are you here? _I thought.
I was standing on the steps of the Arch fully aware that my fingers were painfully cold when the wrong thought crossed my mind. By &amp;ldquo;wrong thought,&amp;rdquo; I mean that one thought that will subconsciously sabotage the important or dangerous thing you are about to attempt. Like thinking, &amp;ldquo;what if the front wheel just fell off?&amp;rdquo; as you&amp;rsquo;re cruising down a winding road on a motorcycle, or &amp;ldquo;what if I forget my lines?</description>

      <description>My light blogging owes to our efforts to change the world in a week. My role is, appropriately, miniscule.
When Congress listens, it will repeal the trillions of waste, fraud, and abuse it has produced over the past 4 months, it will stop proposed borrowing and bailouts, it will stop rewarding bad behavior in corporations and citizens, or it will retire. This time, there are no two ways.
 Using tools like Twitter, email, and Facebook, TCOT has provided at least 163 patriots a forum to voice its discontent on Friday, February 27 at 11:00 a.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, shortly after his inauguration, Barry âThe Presidentâ Obama panicked: the Republicans might talk the people out of the stimulus bill.
Barry moved quickly. But Barry is an organizer, not an engineer. Heâs the cheerleader, not the quarterback. He moves mobs, not nations. And when panicked, he fell apart.
Barry decided to announce that life as we know it would economically end the Day After The Stimulus Bill Is Defeated.</description>

      <description>From his inauguration to the end of his first month in office, President Obama has dropped between 5 and 7 percentage points in approval according to Fox News and Rasmussen, respectively.Â That&amp;rsquo;s the largest first month drop in approval rating of any president since polling began. Barring a major plebiscitory reversal in 2010, Obama will go into the 2012 election with no scapegoats and no Congressional help.Â The Democrat Congress under Reid and Pelosi is the least popular since polling began, and Reid and Pelosi promise to deliver more of what made them so unpopular.</description>

      <description>Yesterday it seemed that Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s principal goal in China was to detach human rights from . . . well, from everything. Today&amp;rsquo;s Washington Post reveals the real purpose of her trip: sales.
Barack Obama has, in a month, made George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s deficits look like surpluses. And he or his cabinet members promise about another $1.5 trillion in direct debt before the fiscal year ends in September.
To finance this socialist expansion of government, Obama must sell bonds and lots of them.</description>

      <description>In the polite political banter between liberal and conservative co-workers this fall, a liberal friend trotted out that tiresome, perennial Democrat litmus test: âThey say the first act of a president is picking a vice-president; look how well Obama handled that.â
Okay.
Obamaâs First Decision Was Disaster
During the campaign, Joe Biden was a laughing stock, relegated to the safe, blue states whereâObama hopedâthe press would ignore him. They did not.</description>

      <description>Former eBay CEOâand conservativeâMeg Whitman has had enough.
Sheâs watch liberalism turn California into Americaâs Iceland.
Sheâs running for governor.
Maybe sheâs the next Reagan. Or Thatcher.
 Whitman built eBay from a tiny start-up to the dominant online auctioneer. She will face at least one other Republican tech exec in the battle for the party nomination &amp;ndash; Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner.
 Run, Meg, run.

      <description>Barack Hussein Obama might be the dumbest man ever to stand behind a podium bearing the Official Seal of the President of the United States of America.
No, wait.Â He is the dumbest man.Â And the whiniest.Â This is like listening to my kids complain about homework.Â Obama has no understanding of basic economics.Â He lacks any knowledge of the Great Depression.Â He seems to actually believe that the New Deal significantly reduced unemployment.</description>

      <description>The Constitution enumerates certain powers to the US government.Â Chief among them is national defense.Â Barack Obama, in his campaign and in his first two weeks as president, has demonstrated a callous disregard for that duty.Â His actions threaten to place Americans in grave danger.Â Safe Since September 11, 2001
Like many, I assumed that Islamofascist terrorists would strike the US within a month or two of 9/11.Â The reasons were obvious at the time:Â we were woefully unprepared, panicked, and confused.</description>

 Now should we conclude that Democrats hate McCain voters and have no remorse over seeing them freeze and die?
 Rednecks die, no one cries (Wizbang)
The answer, of course, is âyes.â Barack Obama is president of blacks, illegal aliens, abortionists, communists, socialists, enviro-terrorists, Islamo-terrorists, and the mentally ill.
Since the white, Republican folks in Appalachia fit none of these categories, Obamaâs happy to watch them suffer and die.</description>

      <description>Well, at least communismâs brightest symbol: piles of mattresses.
In this case, Obamaâs politburo wants to buy and crush new cars and trucks. Yes, GM and Chrysler and Ford can produce all the cars and trucks they want. Since the public wonât buy them, the government willâand crush them. Crush them. I kid you not. This from Gateway Pundit:
Democrats want to include a new car crushing plan in the &amp;ldquo;stimulus&amp;rdquo; bill where the government would buy new cars and trucks that obtain less than 18 mpg and crush them</description>

Hansenâs Boss: James Hansen, AGWâs Father of Lies, received an insulting, public rebuke from his old boss at NASA. In essence, Dr. John Theon of the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies, accused of Hansen of violating basic scientific principles, NASAâs scientific methodologies and policies, and of embarrassing the agency with his anti-scientific screeds on global warming.</description>

What the FOCA?: Some enterprising pro-lifers desiring limited government launched the âWhat the FOCA?â website. The site kicks some of the 1973-style slogans from the Right to Life movement, updating themes and memes for 2009. A great idea, long overdue. Visit often and donate generously if fighting rampant abortion is one of your action focuses.

I wrote &amp;quot;Â I, for one, hopehis presidency is a miserable failure but that the country somehow survives&amp;rdquo; beforeÂ Limbaugh spoke similar sentiments. I started the Campaign to Hope Obama Fails; Rush is a Johnny-come-lately. A fair-weather fan. He&amp;rsquo;s probably a big Steeler fan all of a sudden, too. The next the Democrats feel the need to decry divisiveness, please send them to me.</description>

      <description>In 2005, I blogged about the fact that expert consensus is usually wrong. For instance:
 * More than half of the studies published in medical journals are later proven wrong. * Most experts predicted that oil prices would continue to rise to $200 a barrel as recently as last August, but gas prices have fallen more than 50 percent since. I based[ my prediction of oil in the $30s](https://hennessysview.com/2007/11/13/oil-price-collapse-coming/) on the simple fact that the experts agreed we&#39;d never see oil below $100.</description>

      <description>On Friday, US Premier Barack Hussein Obama tipped his hand on his plans of banning dissent. He told reporters that Republicans must âstop listening to Rush Limbaugh.â
Were Obama an ordinary politician, weâd take this comment as a harmless, oral wish. Limbaugh is an effective advocate for conservatism, limited government, lower taxes, freedom, and peace-through-strengthâall things Obama hates.
Obamaâs not a typical politician in the American sense; heâs a communist. Heâs a totalitarian.</description>

But first, he let gays into the military and sent his wife off to socialize medicine.Â Barack Obama began his presidency during a borderline depression, promising to save the country from economic collapse, lowering the seas, and scripting quality endings to Stephen King&amp;rsquo;s movies. But first, he symbolically flipped off everyone affected by Islamofascist terrorists,snubbed military heroes, andredifined ethics as the way one behaves when the whole world&amp;rsquo;s watching.</description>

Of course, the Nazis trained specialist to carry out these grim and evil tasks. In America, we rely on ordinary citizens to do the killing for us.</description>

Yesterday, Michelle was still the #1 conservative blog&amp;ndash;at 39 overall. Huffington Post is #1, Kos is #8.

Even though this article from IHT failed to suprised me, I have a sick, frightened gnawing in my stomach:
 China has bought more than $1 trillion in American debt, but as the global downturn has intensified, Beijing is starting to keep more of its money at home - a shift that could pose some challenges to the U.</description>

A wonderful, tough, and tireless local Republican organizer named Thelma Stuart recruited me and served as my mentor in Dixiecrat-style politics of South Carolina.Â My first gig was manning the Kemp booth at the Low Country Stump Days in Charleston.</description>

 It seems that NASA&amp;rsquo;s James Hansen, head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), is at it again. He just can&amp;rsquo;t let the data speak for itself. In yet another egregious display of Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) arrogance, he changed the temperature data from 1910-2008 to reflect what is clearly a cooling trend to reflect a warming trend.</description>

      <description>Obama: &amp;lsquo;Trillion-Dollar Deficits For Years&amp;rsquo; - Capital Commerce (usnews.com)
 Just mindblowing. Here is #44 today (via the AP):
 Obama said Tuesday the deficit appears on track to hit $1 trillion soon. Speaking to reporters after meeting with top economic aides, Obama said: &amp;quot;Potentially we&#39;ve got trillion-dollar deficits for years to come, even with the economic recovery that we are working on.&amp;quot;  If Obama really believes that the world economy will tolerate annual deficits north one trillion dollars, he will receive a belated economics education in short order.</description>

      <description>DailyTech - Sea Ice Ends Year at Same Level as 1979
 Thanks to a rapid rebound in recent months, global sea ice levels now equal those seen 29 years ago, when the year 1979 also drew to a close.
 Let&amp;rsquo;s give credit where it&amp;rsquo;s due: Al Gore.
When Al Gore speaks, the opposite happens. Where Al Gore goes,snow is sure to follow. So when Al Gorefrightened a bunch of German kids by telling them that the North Pole would be gone in 5 years, that Santa Claus would die along with his reindeer, and that Polar Bears would either become extinct or catch the last few ice floes south to Europe where they&amp;rsquo;d &amp;ldquo;eat little kiddies like you,&amp;rdquo; you just knew that the Arctic would grow ice faster than Joe Biden&amp;rsquo;s head grows hair plugs.</description>

      <title>Obama&#39;s $300 Billion Tax Cut</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s give credit where it&amp;rsquo;s due, if it&amp;rsquo;s due.
If Barack Obama sends a $300 billion tax cut proposal to Congress as the meat of his stimulus package, he deserves high marks.
Tax Cuts Increase Tax Revenue
A large tax cut aimed at tax payers&amp;ndash;individual and business alike&amp;ndash;will not only stimulate the economy, it will increase federal revenue, defraying the irresponsible and dangerous spending of Paulson and Bernanke. As Kennedy, Reagan, and Bush 43 understood, tax cuts, to a point, increase federal revenue.</description>

      <description>The Huffington Post (of all things) brings us a most cogent, concise, and accurate repudiation of Al Gore and the whole &amp;ldquo;climate change&amp;rdquo; Nazi crowd (h/t ICECAP). Harold Ambler deserves the Nobel Prize for truth stating. Some highlights.
Strike One: How Al Gore (and Hansen and the rest) lie to you about climate change:
 First, the expression &amp;ldquo;climate change&amp;rdquo; itself is a redundancy, and contains a lie. Climate has always changed, and always will.</description>

On the other hand, the United States Postal Service is among the incompetent, bureaucratic, broken down, 19th century, poorly managed excuses for an organization since the Soviet Union went out of business.

      <description>Entitlement is the psychological abnormality in which a person believes that he is owed an enrichment or compensation earned by suffering or activity and that society or government is obligated to pay. It is a psychological condition. It is abnormal&amp;ndash;or should be.
When a team of governors demands that the federal government steal wages and profits of the citizens and transfer those monies to state governors to dispense as the governors see fit, one wonders whether or not the disease is now the norm.</description>

      <description>Feeling confident, relaxed, and complete is a dream. Many people believe it&amp;rsquo;s an impossible dream.Â I&amp;rsquo;m learning otherwise.
I&amp;rsquo;m into my third month of acquiring positive habits with Leo Babauta&amp;rsquo;sZen to Done method.Â At the same time, I&amp;rsquo;m working the 30 day challenge.Â What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far is that I hold onto too much.
 * I carried around anger and frustration over missed goals and failed or abandoned projects * I vilified good people (in my mind) because I wanted to get my way all the time about everything * I sabotaged myself by trying to do everything anyone asked of me * I was afraid to look weak, and that fear weakened me  The faultering economy, no doubt, led me toZen Habits, which led me to Zen to Done, which led me to &amp;ldquo;The Power of Less,&amp;rdquo; which led me to theSedona Method, which led me here.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s first and ten again.
Most years New Years just sort of happens. It arrives. Getting out of 2008 felt like we went for it on 4th and 13 deep inside our own territory. We pulled the goalie and went with a sixth attacker. We sent an injured Albert Pujols to pinch hit for our best reliever. We pulled out all the stops.
The year 2008 will go down as a watershed year.</description>

      <description>I might have mentioned in an earlier post that I quit smoking about a month ago. I must thank Leo Babauta, his blog ZenHabits.net, and his ebook, Zen to Done, for giving me the motivation and confidence to quit.
I have quit in the past. I went almost 4 years between 1998 and 2002, so I know I can do it for good.
While the money I&amp;rsquo;ve saved on cigarettes I&amp;rsquo;ve plowed back into nicotine lozenges, it&amp;rsquo;s amazing how quickly the savings add up:</description>

      <description>The silliness of companies knows no bounds.
The latest act of corporate stupidity comes from the computer maker Dell.
In its attempt to become the &amp;ldquo;greenest technology company on the planet,&amp;rdquo; Dell made much of achieving some farcically theoretical &amp;ldquo;carbon-neutral&amp;rdquo; status. But, like everything associated with AGW, there&amp;rsquo;s really no so thing. WSJ points out in a wonderful examination today:
 In fact, that&amp;rsquo;s only a small fraction of all the emissions associated with Dell.</description>

 Â Malcolm Gladwell is the best researcher-writer alive today.  I declared the book the most important in a generation. People made fun of me.Â Well, Thomas Sowell comes close to echoing my reaction:
 This book is an outstanding achievement in itself, and its readability, insights, and imagination make it one of the best books of 2008 or any other year.</description>

      <description>In a just world where all men are created with equal rights, Bernie Madoff would be a hero. More than any other private sector figure, Bernie Madoff perfectly embodies the new American ideal.
What Madoff Did
Bernie Madoff admitted to investigators that he created an enormous Ponzi&amp;ndash;or pyramid&amp;ndash;scheme. He promised investors very high returns. He made good by paying of Round 1 investors with Round 2&amp;rsquo;s money.

As long as a new generation of investors, larger than the previous, lines up to invest, everything&amp;rsquo;s good.</description>

      <description>Sometimes decades start early; sometimes they start late.
The 1960s started with JFK&amp;rsquo;s assassination&amp;ndash;until then, they were a lot like the 50s except with a young president whose economic policies were to the right of his Republican predecessor&amp;rsquo;s.
The 1970s culturally started with Woodstock in 1969. As Hunter S. Thompson pointed out in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Woodstock was not a celebration but a funeral. It marked the end of the hopeful part of whatever the 60s were and the beginning of the malaise of the 1970s.</description>

      <description>I just finished âThe Power of Lessâ and its companion ebook, âThriving on Less.â I hope everyoneâand I mean everyoneâreads these books before the end of January.
https://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=hennesssview-20&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;p=8&amp;amp;l=as1&amp;amp;asins=1401309704&amp;amp;fc1=000000&amp;amp;IS2=1&amp;amp;lt1=_blank&amp;amp;m=amazon&amp;amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;amp;bc1=000000&amp;amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;f=ifr
Why are these books so important? Because life changed in 2008. The commitments weâd made as individuals, families, communities, nations, and the world received a margin call. We had biggest margin call in history, and everyone from plumbers to Harvard MBAs (especially the MBAs) lacked the capital to pay the bill.</description>

The Dow: The Dow trades within a range of 1,000 points with a daily average closing of 8,500.
GDP and Economy: By July, everyone pretty much calls the situation &amp;ldquo;Great Depression II.&amp;rdquo; Unemployment, which declines in the first quarter, increases to more than 12 percent by fall. Gross Domestic Product by quarter:</description>

      <description>Israel&amp;rsquo;s assault on Hamas terrorists in Gaza continued for a second day. As if reading from a script, the UN Security Council called for an immediate stop to Israel&amp;rsquo;s self-defense. As the air strikes continued, Israel has moved more troops and tanks to the border, possibly in preparation for an incursion into the area now under terrorist control.
Some internation responses were less than predictable, though. France, for instance, demands first that the terrorists stop pitching rockets at Israeli school kids, then that Israel stop its air assault.</description>

 First, all over the world, temperatures have been dropping in a way wholly unpredicted by all those computer models which have been used as the main drivers of the scare. Last winter, as temperatures plummeted, many parts of the world had snowfalls on a scale not seen for decades.</description>

      <description>The increased urgency to legislate or judicially impose new, draconian burdens on society to &amp;ldquo;save the planet&amp;rdquo; is not your imagination. Neither is it a response to increasingly rising temperatures. Temperatures have been falling for 8 years now, and have not risen in more than 10. The reason the AGW alarmists need to impose restrictions is: credit.Â Remember the ozone holes? According to leftists, the holes were caused by chloroflourocarbons like refrigerant used in air conditioning.</description>

 The western tip of Lake Superior has frozen over in December for the first time in recent memory, and that could mean a long season of ice angling that hasnât been seen in years.

Israel attacked dozens of terrorist targets in Gaza today, killing at least 145.
The Arab world (yawn) reacted predictably, condemning Israel (yawn) and staging street protests (yawn). I&amp;rsquo;m sure many a rifle was fired into the air.
The left&amp;ndash;and I suspect Barack Obama is included&amp;ndash;will decry Israel&amp;rsquo;s self-defense. They will call for Israel to show restraint. They will call on Israel to take another body blow.</description>

Just another sign that democracy in America is over. In November, Change.gov banned conservatives from asking questions or offering suggestions to Barack Obama.

 John Brennan, Obama&amp;rsquo;s chief intelligence adviser and anticipated CIA chief, was recently forced to withdraw his name. There was no drumbeat of opposition to Brennan from the front pages or on cable. Rather, the pick was torpedoed by the blogosphere.
 &amp;ldquo;Apparently there is a lot of pressure on the Obama team from a blog saying that Brennan couldn&amp;rsquo;t be made the director of the CIA because he was involved in torture and renditions, which he wasn&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; said Mark Lowenthal, former assistant CIA director.</description>

      <description>Rarely does a single factor cause a paradigm shift. For one example, look at the election of Ronald Reagan. Sure, Reagan had a great message,   expert delivery, and that presidential look. But without Carter&amp;rsquo;s bungling incompetence, excesses by liberals in Congress, a runaway Supreme Court, Soviet expansion, stagflation, the Iranian hostage crisis, and seventeen thousand other annoying problems, Reagan would not have upset an incumbent president in 1980.</description>

      <description>Biden to Lead Task Force on Expanding Middle Class - FOXNews.com Transition Tracker
 As vice president, Joe Biden will oversee an Obama administration effort to find ways of building up the ranks of the middle class, that ambiguously defined segment of society most Americans identify with.
   
What does &amp;ldquo;expanding the middle class&amp;rdquo; entail, exactly? The government has spent tens of trillions of dollars trying to elevate the poor to middle class.</description>

      <description>Can You Still See the USA in Your Chevrolet? by Mark Steyn on National Review Online
 General Motors, like the other two geezers of the Old Three, is a vast retirement home with a small loss-making auto subsidiary. The UAW is the AARP in an Edsel: It has three times as many retirees and widows as âworkersâ (I use the term loosely). GM has 96,000 employees but provides health benefits to a million people.</description>

      <description>New York, Illinois, California, and a dozen other liberal states will raise taxes dramatically in the next 3 months. New York, for instance, is instituting 88 new taxes.
OPEC will cut oil output until oil reaches their target of $75 to $90 a barrel, which equates to $2.30 to $2.80 gasoline.
Obama will impose regulations and taxes that stifle growth.
The Bush capitulation to the Unamerican Auto Workers thugs will allow Detroit to limp for several months before collapsing.</description>

Two stories today illustrate his Nobel-worthy work:
* The [Ionosphere](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/16/earths-ionosphere-drops-to-a-new-low/) is encroaching on our atmosphere, perhaps because [the sun seems to be dying](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/14/even-quieter-on-the-solar-front-another-all-quiet-alert-issued/)** The Earth&#39;s [protective magnetic field](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/16/earths-magnetic-field-has-massive-breach-scientists-baffled/) has a massive breach allowing solar winds to bombard us with space stuff  Both stories illustrate our minute understanding of our planet, its atmosphere, our solar system, the universe, and God.</description>

 Barack Obama had begun thinking about his Senate successor even before the presidential election, and dispatched Rahm Emanuel days after the vote to contact aides of Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich to begin talking up Mr. Obama&amp;rsquo;s preferred candidates, associates of Mr. Emanuel said this weekend.
 Remember that Obama also claimed that no one on his staff or acting on his behalf discussed the seat with Blago.</description>

      <description>Seth Borenstein seems to have dropped the same Global Warming LSD as Al Gore.
Today, in a news article (not opinion, mind you) Borenstein claims that the 10-year cooling trend we&amp;rsquo;re in proves the seriousness of his personal brand of Global Warming. He also passes along flat out lies about temperatures and, especially, sea ice extent&amp;ndash;making up facts that never existed. Borenstein is a terrible polemicist and lazy researcher.
But Borenstein excels as a writer.</description>

Mark the date: according to Gore, on 12/12/2013, there will be zero ice north of the Arctic Circle. This would an amazing change in trends since global sea ice has been growing for 20 years now.</description>

      <description>The United Auto Workers is the sort of extortion racket that gives crime a bad name. For 40 years&amp;ndash;since the introduction of Japanese cars in the US market&amp;ndash;these whining, overpaid slobs have bilked consumers for billions, insisting that they deserve to be overpaid simply because there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of them. America would be better off if the UAW simply ceased to exist.
They make the bogus claim that they are better workers than their non-union counterparts who assemble BMWs, Hondas, Nissans, and Toyotas.</description>

The plan includes a car czar&amp;ndash;something that Toyata, Nissan, and Honda miraculously do not need&amp;ndash;to run the auto industry like a DMV license office. The last time a government designed, built, and sold an automobile like, it was called the Yugo. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep my SUV, thanks.</description>

Apparently, the White House and Congress are trying to invent an auto czar position to &amp;ldquo;oversee the restructuring of the industry [Wall Street Journal].&amp;rdquo;Â That means that the problems that led to the current crisis will get worse and the possible solutions to the crisis will be outlawed.</description>

      <description>Barack Obama has a lot of friends who would like to see a Final Solution to the Middle East, if you get my drift. Samantha Power, for instance, told the Institute for Policy Studies (which was founded by the KGB during the Cold War) that the US should invade Israel and set up a puppet government to impose a suicidal deal with Hamas. Nice, huh?
Add to that a mounting certainty that Iran will deploy a nuclear weapon by the end of 2009&amp;ndash;a year Obama must devote almost solely to the economy.</description>

      <description>Robert Rubin was a key player in keeping Enron afloat while he and his cronies fleeced billions from employees and investors.
Robert Rubin abandoned the Clinton administration when a recession was unavoidable. His relief was his protege, Larry Summers.
Robert Rubin talked the Citigroup board into investing in extremely high-risk mortgage-backed securities. He also showed the bank how to carry those risks off the books&amp;ndash;exactly the way he showed Enron how to do it.</description>

We can find two good results of the terrorist siege of Mumbai, India.
First, Rabbi Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg&amp;rsquo;s baby son, Moshe, escaped alive. Good people have set up a fund for the child where you can contribute. Please do so. The child&amp;rsquo;s survival seems to destine him for greatness, as the story contains odd parallels to the story of Moses.
Second, the tragic events forced organizers to cancel Live Earth India, a pagan celebration to spread the lie of Anthropogenic Global Warming.</description>

      <description>Liberal America is a sub-species of selfish cowards.
India suffered its own 9-11 over the past 3 days. It continues at this hour. Yet America&amp;rsquo;s government, its media, its pundits retreated under the cover of Thanksgiving and the excuse of saving their corrupt and incompetent friends on Wall Street and in Detroit. George Bush and Barack Obama are invisible. CNN and MSNBC refused to call the terrorists who murdered over 160 in cold blood anything stronger than &amp;ldquo;militants.</description>

      <description>Over on The Work Works I&amp;rsquo;ve posted an entry about winning in meetings. It&amp;rsquo;s meant to make meetings contentious, but to ensure they produce results&amp;ndash;and that those results came from you.

      <description>According to Tweeters in the streets of Mumbai outside Nariman House, the Jewish Center, NSG Commandos (Indian special forces) are high-fiving people in the streets. The crowds are singing patriot songs. No gunfire.
Meanwhile, 30 or more bodies were found in the Oberoi hotel.
I hope the West takes a lesson from NSG&amp;rsquo;s fierce, straight-on attack on the terrorists.
Also, have you noticed that our Western, pro-terrorist media (CNN, NY Times, LA Times, MSNBC) refuse to call the Mumbai terrorists &amp;ldquo;terrorists?</description>

      <title>Mumbai Thoughts: Is This Prep for USA Siege?</title>

      <description>Is Mumbai a test run for an attack on the United States?
 Al Qaeda is out of practice. The terror organization has been quite since 2001, pinned down inside in Iraq where our heroes destroyed their efforts to establish a beach head.
The coincidence of the horror in Mumbai with the FBI reports of a serious, legitimate threat to the NYC subway system seems coordinated to me.
Since 9-11, the US, UK, and Israel have trained and developed anti-terrorism techniques jointly with many nations, including India.</description>

      <description>Vietnam was the first televised war. Film from the morning was flown one-stop to California allowing Americans to witness action within 24 hours of its occurrence.
The Gulf War upped the ante with live, streaming video, 24 hours a day on CNN.
September 11 and the liberation of Iraq came with live blogging from people feet from the action.
But reading text messages on Twitter from people on the streets of Mumbai as events unfold is truly bizarre.</description>

      <description>Since no one else will listen to his lies, half-science, and hysteria, the old man of GISS wrote a long letter to the president-elect.
Luckily for the rational world, Richard Courtney (pdf) excoriated Hansen for the letter and for Hansen&amp;rsquo;s continued crusade to end freedom as we know it. Courtney&amp;rsquo;s summary of Hansen&amp;rsquo;s conclusion may go down in annuls of the AGW debate as a masterpiece:
 That &amp;ldquo;conclusion&amp;rdquo; may be correct if it were based on evidence and reasoned argument, but - as explained above - it is not.</description>

      <description>The Internet&amp;ndash;the engine that drove year-over-year increases in sales since its inception&amp;ndash;is unable to overcome the economic malaise in America.
 For the first 23 days of November, online sales declined 4% to $8.2 billion from $8.5 billion the same time last year, according to market-research firm comScore Inc. The firm projects that retail spending online in the months of November and December will total $29.2 billion, flat from the same period last year &amp;ndash; a dreary sign for online retailers, many of which had grown accustomed to double-digit gains.</description>

      <description>Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats could be headed toward a final showdown over abortion and the right of men and women to choose their moral direction.
Obama has promised in bold and belligerent words to make the Freedom of Choice Act his first, most important act as President. Consistent with his lifelong passion for encouraging abortion, even encouraging his daughters to have abortions, Obama&amp;rsquo;s first act as President will be to drive a permanent wedge between the United States and the Catholic church.</description>

      <description>While we in America credit Ronald Reagan with saving modern conservatism and the Western World, it was Margaret Thatcher who preceded Reagan and set the world stage for his entrance, stage right.
Thatcher rose to the top of British government in response to decades of expensive, debilitating leftward drift in Europe. The countries of NATO faced a long series of self-inflicted financial crises, the KGB incited their youth toward socialism and Sovietphilia, and taxes were out of control.</description>

      <description>This morning I felt no compulsion to get back in bad after turning off the alarm at 5:00. I must be getting used to the practice.
I have been about 90 percent on writing down (Jotting) every commitment that comes into my world. Oddly, the ones I&amp;rsquo;m most likely to overlook are the most obvious and visible duties.
Ignoring the Big Rocks
For example, today my boss asked me to kick off a project that I&amp;rsquo;d been asking to do for some time.</description>

      <description>The US Government is now on the hook for $7.7 trillion in bailouts and guarantees trying to stave another Great Depression [source]. Mathematically, the government&amp;rsquo;s scheme cannot work.
Bailout Costs in Perspective
World War II cost about $2.1 trillion in 1990 dollars, which I calculate to be $3.5 trillion in 2008 (assuming 2.8 percent inflation over the period.). (San Francisco Chronicle puts a $5 trillion tag on WWI, though.) It took 50 years to pay off that debt.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s hope that this weeks sees Congress and Barack&amp;rsquo;s team come to their collective senses about bailouts.
Government intervention in the private problems afflicting General Motors, Chrysler, and the finance business effective reward poor leadership. Leaving executive compensation off the table completely, the government should foster a healthy climate for business, but no more.
General Motors is not too big to fail; it&amp;rsquo;s too proud to do the right thing.</description>

 We wanted to update you on the media reports regarding the Our Country Deserves Better Committee&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Thank You Sarah Palin&amp;rdquo; television ad campaign that launches this week. Both CNN and CNN International contacted us for interviews on the subject. The Wall Street Journal ran an online report as did the publication Advertising Age.

Challenges of Weekend ZTD
First, most of my list items focus on work. That meant I&amp;rsquo;d have to shift my list management to look for loose ends from the work week that could be tied up from home and on items to do at home and errands.</description>

      <description>In Zen to Done (ZTD), Leo Babauta recommends working on one positive new habit at a time. He further recommends adopting the habits in the order presented in the book and warns that the temptation is to follow the advice of most similar systems and attempt a dozen new habits all at once.
Since I have none of the positive habits recommended in ZTD or in David Allen&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Getting Things Done,&amp;rdquo; which I&amp;rsquo;ve been re-implementing for nearly a decade, I decided to follow Babauta&amp;rsquo;s advice to the letter, with on exception: I use a digital notebook.</description>

      <description>The Federal Reserve Board&amp;rsquo;s Open Market Committee released the minutes of its October 28-29 meeting, today, in which some members raise the specter of economic depression extending more than 4 consecutive quarters. The report calls the present financial mess the worst in more than half a century, carefully avoiding direct references to the Great Depression.
Stocks Tank
Wall Street responded with 427 point (5.16 percent) collapse, with Citigroup leading financial stocks to a 10 percent crash.</description>

      <description>It turns out, according to a Zogby poll to be released in its entirety today, that most Obama voters are woefully, frighteningly, and unforgivably ignorant of the basic facts of government and of Barack Obama himself. Not surprising. Dickens warned us of the dangers of ignorance in &amp;ldquo;A Christmas Carol&amp;quot;:
 Suddenly, Scrooge noticed something strange about the ghost. Two children-like figures were at the ghost&amp;rsquo;s feet - a boy and a girl.</description>

      <description>A federal bailout for the Big Three auto manufacturers will be direct transfer of wealth from the middle class to the upper class. Auto workers are, by Joe Biden&amp;rsquo;s definition, &amp;ldquo;wealthy.&amp;rdquo;
Union auto workers more than the average executive manager with an MBA and nearly 3 times the wage of the average teacher with a master&amp;rsquo;s degree. That&amp;rsquo;s why the Big 3 are dying, and that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what the unions deserve.</description>

In Philadelphia, you can be arrested simply for wearing McCain-Palin t-shirts, as proven in this video.

      <description>Dr. Hansen apparently believes the world is as stupid as, well, as stupid as the world seems to be.
All of the October surface station temperature from Russia was corrupted. So what did Hansen do? He simply copied and pasted Russia&amp;rsquo;s temperatures for September into October and reported that October 2008 was the hottest October on record.
Why isn&amp;rsquo;t James Hansen in prison? The AGW argument has lost so much steam that he&amp;rsquo;s resorted this level of lying, fraud, and deceit.</description>

      <description>From Rich Lowry (editor of National Review) to Norman Ornstein (American Enterprise Institute), conservatives cry out for &amp;ldquo;message that resonates with young people and minorities.&amp;rdquo;
Hogwash.
Barack Obama won the election because, given the choice of two vacuous and banal &amp;ldquo;messages,&amp;rdquo; voters went with the more interesting one.
Blaming conservatism, Reagan, Christians, and clingers for the 2008 election results betrays a kind of ignorance for which non-profits raise funds to cure.</description>

      <description>Most enduring political truths are exposed and accessible in the 1995 Mel Gibson classic Braveheart: freedom, eros, love of country, sacrifice, loss, anger, vengeance, lust, hatred,betrayal, evil, and everything in between. Conservatives should see moderate Republicans in the character of Robert the Bruce&amp;rsquo;s leper father.

      <title>The Rush to Climate Change Laws</title>

      <description>According to reports, Barack Obama will spend most of the afternoon of January 20, 2009, signing Executive Orders to ban or limit activities that produce CO2. Bankrupting the coal and steel industries apparently can&amp;rsquo;t wait for legislative action.
Why the rush? Why is Obama in such a hurry to put tens of thousands of people out of work?
Obama and the left want to get CO2 laws in place so they can claim the laws stopped and reversed global warming.</description>

      <description>Holy crap! That was the best speech McCain ever delivered. It was heartfelt and powerful. It was moving. It was . . . remarkable.
And it reminded me of a great reason to celebrate. Let me explain.
I was born in 1963 when there were still &amp;ldquo;Colored&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;White&amp;rdquo; drinking fountains. Obama&amp;rsquo;s a few years older.
Tonight, despite my best efforts and many others, we have a black President. That&amp;rsquo;s amazing in a very good way.</description>

      <description>Sober, I scratch out some ideas for recovery.
 1. The conservative movement must forget the Republican party.Â If the GOP wants to come along with us, they&#39;re welcome.Â But we won&#39;t listen to their nonsense about &amp;quot;[big tents](https://hennessysview.com/2008/02/05/why-vote-republican/)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;get over Reagan.&amp;quot;Â The Republican party was an irresponsible steward of conservatism for the past 20 years.Â Tonight it got its just deserts.Â Too bad the rest of us have to endure re-education camps, economic depression, and malaise because of them.</description>

      <description>Ignorance is no defense.
Americans, faced with the choice of Marxist-socialism or republican-capitalism, a plurality chose communism.
Their moral weakness, combined with viral corruption of character, has created a majority coalition of indecisive morons known as independents, children who want government to make their decisions and butter their bread, and neo-Marxists, like Obama. We fought the Cold War for nothing.
Over the next two years, we will see the most complete change in a nation seen since the Bolshevik Revolution nearly 100 years ago in Russia:</description>

UPDATE 8:05: Senate Calls (that matter) John Barrasso (R) wins special election in Wyoming; Mike Enzi (R) wins re-election; Republican Pat Robert wins re-election in Kansas; Tim Johnson (D) wins re-election in SD; Dems pick up Pete Dominici&amp;rsquo;s Senate seat in New Mexico (Dems +4); Jeff Session retains his seat, as does Thad Cochran (both Republicans); the special election for Senate in Mississippi too close to call, but the Republican leads.</description>

When the Convention concluded with the Constitution, Madison wrote, Benjamin Franklin said, &amp;ldquo;I have often looked at that behind the president without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting. But now I&amp;hellip; know that it is a rising&amp;hellip;sun.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>It should be clear by now, but I figured I&amp;rsquo;d point it out: Idiots like the editors of National Review, Christopher Buckley, and Peggy Noonan need to retire. Republican moderates, including McCain, are getting their rear-ends kicked, and they&amp;rsquo;re taking self-government with them.
The only way to defeat leftism is with hard core conservatism.
The debate is over.

      <description>Philadelphia, PA&amp;ndash; Philadelphia today saw the most votes cast in the city&amp;rsquo;s history as measured by percentage and raw numbers. Oddly enough, only about 4,000 people actually showed up at polling places to cast votes.
&amp;ldquo;It was remarkably efficient,&amp;rdquo; said Philly Mayor Nutter (D). &amp;ldquo;We managed to break voting records without forcing people to leave work early or find the polling places. This is a model for the country.&amp;rdquo;
For the numbers, 127 percent of the eligible voters were represented in the final number, and nearly 1,800,000 votes cast.</description>

I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make too much of it, though. Urban area tend to dump more data at the mid-day collection than suburban and rural areas do. Remember that in 2004, the media all but called Ohio for Kerry at 3:00 in the afternoon based on exit poll results.</description>

 Team Obama is busily preparing to dash his supporters&amp;rsquo; hope for change should he win the presidential election on Tuesday. Even in the final days before the election, the pressure to deliver on his lofty promises has Obama attempting to dampen expectations on the campaign trail:

If Barack Obama wins, America will no longer be a free country when anyone can grow up to be President or CEO of a company. We know this by Obama&amp;rsquo;s writings and words and those of his Congressional allies.</description>

According to Obama himself this force will be armed and funded as heavily as the US Armed Forces. Unlike the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marines, this force will aim its destructive power on political dissidents.
&amp;ldquo;We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we&amp;rsquo;ve set,&amp;rdquo; Dear Leader said Wednesday.</description>

  Since July 2008, Obama&amp;rsquo;s definition of rich has been declining at rate of 20 percent per month. Simple extrapolation shows that even minimum wage earners will face a tax increase by the time any legislation can be enacted in June 2009.</description>

Some call the Friday poll an anomaly, but there&amp;rsquo;s reason to believe it&amp;rsquo;s not.
Joe the Plumber and Tito the Builder resonate with an increasing number of voters. These are ordinary Americans who work hard to make a better life for their families.

First, this shows nature&amp;rsquo;s ability to heal itself far exceeds man&amp;rsquo;s ability to heal it. Second, it shows that the AGW crowd are liars.</description>

 Obama has been encouraging voters to go to the polls for early voting. The Democratic nominee . . . released a new 30-second spot on his Web site urging voters to &amp;ldquo;talk to your boss&amp;rdquo; or professor and then take the day off from work or school to volunteer for his campaign on Election Day.</description>

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t.

      <description>There are two reasons to read this column, every inch, every delicious letter, comma, period, semi-colon, and sidebar.
First&amp;ndash;
Elaine Lafferty former editor-in-chief of Ms. magazine, has spend a lot of time around Sarah Palin and found her remarkable. Palin smart and has great . . . instincts.
Second&amp;ndash;
Read the first comment by an idiot woman named mariah. Mariah was frightened by Palin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;McCarthy&amp;rdquo;-like warning that, if Obama is elected, Mariah&amp;rsquo;s property will be in jeopdy.</description>

      <description>Cleveland, OH &amp;ndash; Citing concern for their safety in anincreasingly anti-Semitic USA, Democrat presidential candidate Barack Obama today announced a plan to provide Jews with additional protection.
The plan, called &amp;ldquo;HOPE . . . We&amp;rsquo;ll Protect You,&amp;rdquo; requires urges Jews to register with their local Social Security Administration office.Â After filling out a short form, SSA will photograph the citizen and implant a small microchip on the Jew&amp;rsquo;s left arm.Â The chip, about the size of a pencil lead, will allow authorities to quickly identify Jews killed or injured should anti-Semitic violence increase.</description>

      <description>In an NPR interview in 2001, Barack Obama admitted that he despises the US Constitution because it limits government. He stated that the Warren Court did not go far enough in redistributing wealth.Â In essence, the tape confirmed conservatives&amp;rsquo; worst suspicions of Obama&amp;rsquo;s motives.Â Last night, I blogged on light side, asking those who support Obama whether or not they&amp;rsquo;re ready to change the US form of government.Â I tried to make the case that Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s long associations with admitted communists and terrorists, combined with expected Democrat control of both houses of Congress, placed at risk the idea of self-government, limited in its powers by a Constitution written by the People and enumerating those particular powers that we cede to the government.</description>

      <description>Among the most important titles we have in the Catholic Church for the Blessed Virgin Mary are Our Lady of Victory and Our Lady of the Rosary. These titles can be traced back to one of the most decisive times in the history of the world and Christendom. The Battle of Lepanto took place on October 7 (date of feast of Our Lady of Rosary), 1571. This proved to be the most crucial battle for the Christian forces against the radical Muslim navy of Turkey.</description>

      <description>With a little more than a week before a presidential election that could change America&amp;rsquo;s form of government, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the election as Reagan might.
I understand that many Americans are upset with the current conditions in the country. You believe that George Bush mishandled the war in Iraq, at least for a couple of years. While you&amp;rsquo;re willing to concede that the news media intentionally misled you about American successes in Iraq, you saw enough to conclude that the Administration made some mistakes&amp;ndash;and those mistakes cost lives.</description>

Williams should be taken out and shot. The best we can hope for in our wimpy society is for a Marine to beat the living hell out of him. The fact that he&amp;rsquo;s an old man makes no difference: you pretend to be a war hero for political purposes, you get whatever comes to you.</description>

      <description>The US launched an attack against terrorists inside Syria, killing at least eight deserving sons of bitches.
 Ninety percent of foreign fighters enter Iraq through Syria, according to U.S. intelligence estimates. Foreign fighters often enter Iraq in order to bring cash to Al Qaeda in Iraq&amp;rsquo;s chief. They also are deadly &amp;ndash; trained in bomb-making and willing to sacrifice themselves in suicide attacks.
 Syria has permitted terrorists to stage attacks against American in Iraq for five years.</description>

      <description>Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s campaign blacklisted WFTV, a Florida television station, because its anchoress, Barbara West, refused to ask Joe Biden the questions prepared and approved by the Obama campaign.
Barabara West asked Biden hard hitting questions&amp;ndash;almost as hard-hitting as questions routinely fired at GOP Vice President candidate Sarah Palin. At one point, Biden said, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know who&amp;rsquo;s writing your questions,&amp;rdquo; showing his surprised that West was making up questions rather than reading the ones written for her by the Obama campaign.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t have the heart. It&amp;rsquo;s too depressing. The news is that Obama will win in a landslide because Americans have given up on themselves. They want Obama to:
* Outlaw personal retirement savings, [seize all 401k assets](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/10/it-has-begun-dem-leaders-call-for-25.html), and create new, bigger version of Social Security** Reduce the military by [at least 25 percent](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/10/it-has-begun-dem-leaders-call-for-25.html), surrendering Afghanistan and Iraq while leaving Eastern Europe and Israel to fend for themselves** Raise taxes on everyone who&#39;s not them** Pass draconian Global Warming laws because the people are too stupid to figure out that man-made global warming is a lie  The list goes on.</description>

      <description>Say you work for a good-size, privately held company called X-Dyne Inc. X-Dyne has revenues of $2 billion a year and employs 4,000 people. Last year, X-Dyne&amp;rsquo;s EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) was $20,000. After taxes, the company made $11.1 million in profits.
The company used those profits to fund this year&amp;rsquo;s growth investments: hiring new employees, advertising and sales, research and development. Because the company&amp;rsquo;s strategy is to fund all growth with internal profits, it keeps a healthy bank account to continue operations should a large client leave the firm or should the economy turn down.</description>

      <description>Homes for the Rest of Us is my response to the mess that is the finance industry.Â The Harvard MBAs screwed up the whole finance thing. So how are people supposed to get houses? We&amp;rsquo;ll just have to take care of ourselves. And each other.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly how this will work, but I am pretty damn sure we can make it happen.
There&amp;rsquo;s this great program called Kiva.org that allows people to make micro-loans to entrepreneurs, mostly in emerging or plain dysfunctional economies.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to knock off the niceties about Barack Obama and race.
Barack Obama has a college education, political office, and a name because he black and from a broken home. He happened to hit college age when it was still vogue to promote minorities through the education system, including Harvard Law, regardless of their abilities.
As a result of the misguided, dangerous attempts by guilt-ridden liberals to right a wrong they did not commit, America is on the brink of electing a mentally deficient Marxist president.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;d think his genes would have better prepared Christopher Buckley for hard times.
On Friday, the son of conservative icon William F. Buckley, endorsed Barack Obama for president. Why? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure, really, and judging by Buckley&amp;rsquo;s rambling, unfunny endorsement in The Daily Beast, neither is he.
Buckley doesn&amp;rsquo;t care for Sarah Palin, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure. He seems vaguely anti-religious, which would gravely wound his parents&amp;rsquo; hearts&amp;ndash;but they probably knew already.</description>

At the outset, I cautioned participants against the tendency to look toward recent economic slowdowns for guidance: &amp;ldquo;this isn&amp;rsquo;t like 1991 or 2001,&amp;rdquo; I told them. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll have to go back to 1979-83 or 1929-42 to find a parallel.&amp;rdquo;

  &amp;ldquo;I like Hormel,&amp;rdquo; Wachovia food analyst Walter Crimsin told Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View. &amp;ldquo;Families that are lucky enough to avoid the soup kitchens will be looking for value in their animal protein purchases. Spam has been a staple poverty food since before the last Depression, and I think it&amp;rsquo;ll outperform the market in this one.</description>

      <description>After showing signs of life following Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s top-shelf performance against Joe Biden on Friday, McCain reminded me of an addict who fell off the wagon. He&amp;rsquo;s addicted to boredom. It was like previous horrendous performances by Republican Senior Guardsmen: Bob Dole in 1996, George H. W. Bush in 1992. Did McCain look at his watch?
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, folks, but this guy does not want to be president. I have no doubt that he did.</description>

      <description>Somewhere between The Republican National Convention and the first debate on September 26, John McCain left the race. It&amp;rsquo;s as if the McCain campaign remains on suspension pending resolution of the economic crisis. Why?
It&amp;rsquo;s possible, of course, that McCain is simply inept at closing the deal. As every baseball fan knows, closers don&amp;rsquo;t grow on trees. Many fine pitchers flounder in the ninth inning with a narrow lead. They&amp;rsquo;re not all Bob Gibson.</description>

      <description>In 2004, John McCain cosponsored legislation to clean up the criminal fraud of Obama advisorFranklin Raines&amp;rsquo;s Fannie Mae. The WSJ has a round up of key Democrats defending Raines&amp;rsquo;s fraud, calling the regulators and auditors liars, and telling McCain to stuff his reforms where sun shineth not.

      <description>Washington, DC&amp;ndash;As economists and taxpayers began to dissect the Economic Rescue bill passed by the U. S. Senate tonight, many experts were surprised to learn that tax payers are in line for trillions of reward points.
Reward points are a popular perk used by banks, hotels, airlines, and retailers to encourage consumers to use their services and credit cards. What legislators failed to realize when authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to assume billions of dollars of bad debt was that the reward points associated with those loans transfer to the U.</description>

      <description>I received a comment to my post on St. Louis area prosecutors targeting anti-Obama speech. I&amp;rsquo;ll post, here, the comment and my reponse. I hope the commenter, Bill, is on the up-and-up.  Iâm an old high school friend of (St. Louis Circuit Attorney) Jennifer Joyce. Watching that initial KMOV report was like a punch in the gut. I just couldnât believe what I was seeing. I talked to her on the phone today to try and get her side of the story.</description>

      <description>so this will be my only post&amp;ndash;a series of thoughts on the day.
Financial Armageddon
In case you were too busy with your normal life and missed it, the financial armageddon promised/threatened by President Bush, Nancy Pelosi, Hank Paulson, and every other power freak on the planet failed to materialize. The Dow ended up 485 points, erasing well over half of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s losses. Before Congress does something stupid, let&amp;rsquo;s just see what happens if we, the people, are left to our own devices&amp;ndash;the way the founders planned it and the way it worked for 150 years before do-gooder morons fucked everything up.</description>

      <description>In the turmoil over the Socialist Reverse-Redistribution Act of 2008, you might have missed the news that a federal grand jury has subpoenaed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 The subpoena seeks documents relating to accounting, disclosure and corporate governance matters dating back to January 2007, Freddie Mac said in a statement.
 They should go back to 2000.</description>

      <description>As the Wall Street crowd howls, Americans should thank the 228 Republicans and Democrats who voted against the most socialist piece of legislation offered since Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s failed attempt to nationalize medicine.
Make the Banks Fix It

      <description>I wrote three versions of this story over the weekend. I didn&amp;rsquo;t publish any of them because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want police harassment and political persecution by St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch. I am embarrassed to admit this, but it demonstrates how dangerous the Democrat party is to American freedom.

      <description>Barry &amp;ldquo;Himmler&amp;rdquo; Obama mocked John McCain for claiming that the administration&amp;rsquo;s $700 billion bailout plan lacked the votes to pass. At the White House meeting last Thursday, Obama was insulting and abusive to everyone in the room. The man who didn&amp;rsquo;t know that the inauguration is in January and not November appeared not to know that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t President.
Turns out McCain was right. Even after making progress in Washington last week and over the weekend, the bailout package still lacked a majority in the House.</description>

      <description>John McCain took an enormous risk today by suspending his campaign for President in order to do his job as a Senator, party leader, and statesman. He returned to Washington to help prevent an economic depression brought about by Obama&amp;rsquo;s financial advisors, among others.
Barack Obama ratcheted up the heat on McCain and Bush, blaming them for what his friends have done to America.
McCain is noble and honorable; Obama is a putz.</description>

      <description>On the night that the President of the United States described America&amp;rsquo;s current economic condition in terms reminiscent of the Great Depression comes word from Ben Smith at Politico that one of the chief architects of the next depression, Countrywide and Fannie Mae thief James Johnson, is advising Barack Obama on how to proceed on this crisis.
Smith quotes former Senator Tom Daschle:
Jim Johnson and I have scheduled another informal breakfast discussion and update on the campaign early next month.</description>

      <description>Last week, Rams owner Chip Rosenbloom all but promised Rams fans that head coach Scott Linehan would be fire along with others responsible for assembling and running the worst football in the NFL.
  You might think that Linehan and the Rams would have opened a can of backs-against-the-wall whoopass on the 0-2 Seahawks today.
They didn&amp;rsquo;t. Apparently, they fumbled the whoopass can in the locker room before the game, drenching themselves with the toxic substance.</description>

 Barack Obama made the calamity on Wall Street the central theme of his case against John McCain on Saturday, invoking the crisis to pound his rival on Social Security, health care and government reform.
 Let me get this straight: The highest-paid Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac politician on the planet wants to blame the financial crisis on the only politician whom Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were unable to bribe!</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s easy, as one gets older, to feel sorry for himself. Well, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not feeling sorry for oneself as much as regretting some of the decisions we&amp;rsquo;ve made.</description>

      <description>Time magazine&amp;rsquo;s Karen Tumulty says that criticizing Franklin Raines&amp;ndash;the heart and soul of our current economic near-meltdown&amp;ndash;is racism because . . . Raines is black.
Therefore, criticizing any black is racism.
I&amp;rsquo;ve criticized and accused Franklin Raines brutally in the past two weeks, so I must be a regular David Dukes.Â Perhaps Karen Tumulty needs to change her meds.
Readers may not believe this, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize Raines was black until after I&amp;rsquo;d posted the second of my blog posts linking to Obama to Raines and Johnson and others responsible for the housing bubble and meltdown.</description>

For the second week in a row, a team without serious injuries humiliated itself, its city, and the players&amp;rsquo; families on national television.
Defense, offense, and special teams were sickeningly lackadaisical and inept. It was like watching squirrels do trigonometry.
If I owned this team, the entire coaching staff would be fired tonight.

Last week, Fatimah Ali, a radical black writer, wrote in the Philadelphia News that if McCain wins, there will be a full-scale race war.
 If McCain wins, look for a full-fledged race and class war, fueled by a deflated and depressed country, soaring crime, homelessness - and hopelessness!</description>

Reasonable people&amp;rsquo;s opinions of the messiah were already on the down slope, but his resorting to name-calling should pretty much assure his defeat.
He took the time to disguise the insult:Â &amp;ldquo;You can put lipstick on a pig, but it&amp;rsquo;s still a pig,&amp;rdquo; the Democrat said, referring to Palin&amp;rsquo;s famous ad lib that the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is the lipstick.</description>

Ever since Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s meteoric rise into political stardom, political junkies left and right have speculated that Team Obama could dump Joe Biden (due to some unfortunate family issue like Joe&amp;rsquo;s emerging pro-life stance) and replace him with Hillary Clinton.Â Think of it as second life for Rush Limbaugh&amp;rsquo;s Operation Chaos which extended the Democrat Nomination fight right up to mid-June.Â Let&amp;rsquo;s explore what that scenario might do to the race.</description>

      <title>Biden:  &#34;Life Begins At Conception&#34;</title>

      <description>Senator and VP candidate Joe Biden today broke from the DNC and from Barack Obama declaring his belief that life begins at conception, according to the New York Times.
Biden must have a very difficult time reconciling that belief with his public support of abortion rights. If he truly believes that life begins at conception, supporting abortion under and circumstances is tantamount to advocating murder.
Biden admits that he cannot fully reconcile the two opposing views:</description>

      <description>Tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s USAToday (online now) carries the latest Gallup Poll of Likely Voters.Â McCain-Palin opened a 10-point lead over Obama-Biden in the first poll conducted completely following the GOP convention.
 In the new poll, taken Friday through Sunday, McCain leads Obama by 54%-44% among those seen as most likely to vote. The survey of 1,022 adults, including 959 registered voters, has a margin of error of +/â 3 points for both samples.</description>

      <description>If you missed FoxNews&amp;rsquo;s Sunday new program, you missed a beautiful undressing of a liberal lie.
Juan Williams, defending Barack Obama, said that Americans were sick and tired of the wealthy not paying their fair share of taxes. Juan was flat out angry.
Brit Hume elegantly and calmly informed him, &amp;ldquo;Juan, the top 1 percent of income earners are paying a higher percentage of the total federal revenues than ever before.</description>

      <description>This degenerate America-hater who goes by the name Charley James claims to live in Toronto, and claims to have friends in Alaska. He has earned his 15 minutes of fame by giving himself a Peyote enema and making up a ridiculous story about Sarah Palin complete with a fictitious waitress named &amp;ldquo;Lucille,&amp;rdquo; a name he probably pulled from Hunter S. Thompson&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.&amp;rdquo; (I don&amp;rsquo;t have the book in front of me, but I believe that Lucille was the name of the maid that Duke&amp;rsquo;s attorney attacked in the hotel room when the attorney mistook the maid&amp;rsquo;s mop for an axe handle.</description>

      <description>Today the St. Louis Rams played the worst game in the history of the oft-horrible history, losing 38-3 to a mediocre Philadelphia Eagles team.
Watching the game on a big, HD television made the spectacle ever more frightening.Â The incompetence, laziness, lack of preparedness, inept game planning and powder-puff tackling seemed to delight head coach Scott Linehan, who believes winning is over-rated.
Linehan&amp;rsquo;s remarkable leadership and motivation worked magic on new offensive coordinator Al Saunders.</description>

      <description>Two polls&amp;ndash;Zogby and Gallup&amp;ndash;now have John McCain and Sarah Palin leading Barack Obama and Joe Biden by 4 and 3 percentage points, respectively. Both leads are beyond the margins of error.
Clearly, the voters like what they see in McCain and, especially, Palin. These results also validate the idea that Democrat lies and smears aimed at Palin are actually helping the GOP ticket.
As a result of these numbers, Barack Obama has abandoned the traditional, academic definition of recession, and breaking another promise to his far left supporters: he will extend the Bush tax cuts in order to help the economy.</description>

      <description>The messiah today told ABC News that he considered joining the military, only there weren&amp;rsquo;t any big wars going on at the time.Â  But keep in mind â I graduated in 1979. The Vietnam War had come to an end. We weren&amp;rsquo;t engaged in an active military conflict at that point. And so, it&amp;rsquo;s not an option that I ever decided to pursue.
 I guess we&amp;rsquo;re all stupid enough to believe that had Vietnam dragged on a bit longer, Obama would have marched his scrawny ass down to the nearest Marine Corps recruiter and signed up for infantry.</description>

      <description>Sarah Palin will push 9 toss-up states into McCain&amp;rsquo;s camp (from left to right):
 * Nevada * Colorado * New Mexico * [Michigan](https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13198.html) * New Hampshire * IndianaÂ * Ohio * Virginia * [Florida](https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReportEmail.aspx?g=e3a24829-6f3f-4928-b30f-cb21804091f0)  This will give McCain the Electoral College victory in November, 300 to 238.Â The Palin-Effect works two different ways: Rough Rider Admiration and Strong Woman Identification. This estimate and projection is based on analysis of detailed polling data from Gallup and Reuters.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard John McCain&amp;rsquo;s horrible experience in Vietnam.Â I&amp;rsquo;ve never before heard him tell it.
What strikes me is the enormous contrast between him and Barack Obama.Â John McCain has lived a noble, heroic, remarkable life.Â Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s read about such things.
John McCain left it all on the battle field, then in a POW camp, then in hospitals where he gave his all for his country.Â Barack Obama took everything he could get his hands on:Â money from a convicted slum-lord felon, street cred from bigotted America-hating minister, political favor from a convicted anti-American terrorist.</description>

      <description>Jay Nordlinger writes on NRO:
   And, believe it or not, this advice might be worth something: I caution liberals, both in politics and in the media (same diff, right?), not to let Palin drive them nuts. A lot of conservatives â a lot of us conservatives, I might say â were driven nuts by Clinton. We were driven nuts by his enduring popularity in the face of tremendous misdeeds.</description>

      <description>Ponder this: The Republicans may win this election because we believe a woman can have both a career and a family, and the Democrats believe she cannot. Never would have dreamed it possible.
Harry Reid&amp;rsquo;s office sent a press release describing Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s speech as &amp;ldquo;shrill&amp;rdquo; in response to Palin&amp;rsquo;s shot at Reid&amp;rsquo;s declaration of surrender. What a wuss.
The liberal women on CNN are PISSED at Reid. They take it as a shot at women.</description>

      <description>Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s Vice Presidential acceptance speech was a grand slam, walk-off homerun to the opposite field that knocked a beer out of Obama&amp;rsquo;s hand after the concession stand closed.
She was smooth, easy, natural, funny, smart, real, genuine, organic, and brilliant.
My favorite line: &amp;quot; . . . after the fake, styrofoam Greek columns have been hauled back to the lot in Hollywood . . .&amp;rdquo;

      <description>The elitist, socialite, degenerate, bowel-licker Sally Quinn says that Sarah Palin is not only unfit for public office, but an unfit mother. Now she&amp;rsquo;s trying to convince Bill O&amp;rsquo;Reilly that she&amp;rsquo;s Palin&amp;rsquo;s equal in the handling of rifle. She just can&amp;rsquo;t make up her mind.
Quinn, who said a woman with 5 children has no business holding an important job, is, herself, a working mother. Perhaps Quinn is a slacker, though.</description>

. . .
 They say I lack experience.Â They&amp;rsquo;re right, in a way.
 I have no experience wandering a city for three years trying to find myself.Â No, I&amp;rsquo;ve never had that luxury.Â But Barack Obama has.
And I have no experience funneling money from an educational trust into organizations run by my close friend, the convicted terrorist.Â No experience at all.
Nor do I have the experience of having a political career launched by a pair of terrorists who tried to blow up the Capitol and the Pentagon, who succeeded in killing a police officer.</description>

      <description>Fred Thompson validated all of my reasons for being a conservative and a Republican. Joe Lieberman vindicated my decision to support John McCain. The combination of speakers and videos restored in Republicans that swagger we had when Reagan handed over the reins to George H. W. Bush.
After two days of disgraceful, amoral, hate, innuendo, and cynicism from the leftist media in this country, the parade of grown-ups must have struck every viewer as the nation&amp;rsquo;s passage from infancy to a particularly profound adulthood.</description>

      <description>Despite promises from Barack Obama that his campaign would drop attacks on its Republican rivals during Hurricane Gustav, that walking hunk of excrement, Joe Biden, broke the promise and ripped into John McCain today during a stump speech.
 The only guy in America in a position of some authority who is out of sync with the whole rest of the world is John McCain.
 Earlier in the day, Biden skipped out on a planned appearance at Labor Day parade in Pittsburgh, Pa.</description>

      <description>Asked about Bristol Palin&amp;rsquo;s pregnancy, Barack Obama firmly stated that children of candidates are &amp;ldquo;off limits,&amp;rdquo; and that anyone in his campaign discussing the matter &amp;ldquo;will be fired.&amp;rdquo;
Outstanding. I watched and heard the interview, and I have no doubt he meant what he said. His vigor was sincere.
As someone who villifies Obama regularly, I owe it to the man when he comes through. This time he did.
I hope his minions listen.</description>

      <description>More bad news about John McCain&amp;rsquo;s selection for Vice President emerged tonight. Sarah Palin was cited for fishing without a license.
CNN is sending a team of reporters and producers to Wasilla, Alaska, to cover this emerging scandal.
The citation does not indicate what she was fishing with or for, but the fact that a would-be Vice President of the United States did, with malice aforethought, cast her line into known fishing waters with the intent of extracting&amp;ndash;or reasonably expecting to extract&amp;ndash;a live fish demonstrates her unfitness for office of any kind.</description>

      <description>Un-fucking-believable.Â Wolff Blitzer has no shame.Â His show is devoting the 5:00 p.m. hour to continuing the idiotic rumor that Sarah Palin faked her fifth pregnancy to cover the actual pregnancy of her daughter.
They also spent 10 minutes spinning innuendo over the troopergate fabrication.Â CNN&amp;rsquo;s justification is that Palin hired a lawyer to handle the investigation.Â Duh!Â What was she supposed to do, hire a veterinarian?Â Her political enemies, of which she has many due to her cleaning-up of the GOP in Alaska, have seized upon a family dispute between Palin&amp;rsquo;s sister and brother-in-law, a State Trooper in Alaska.</description>

  RENO, Nevada&amp;ndash;Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) announced today that the battle against Hurricane Gustav &amp;ldquo;is lost. New Orleans is lost. I demand that President Bush withdraw all National Guardsmen immediately.&amp;rdquo;
Last year, Reid declared the war in Iraq lost, even as the troop surge began to show impressive signs toward ultimate victory. Today, he made his statement shortly after winds died down in New Orleans, and after the Army Corps of Engineers reported that the levees appeared to hold.</description>

      <description>Not an exaggeration.Â Gateway Pundit was an intended target as leftist protestors hurled sacks of rocks and cement on speeding busses of GOP delegates, media, and participants.Â The leftards stood on overpasses above an interstate highway and dropped the sacks on passing busses.
A few years back in St. Louis, a woman&amp;ndash;recent emigrant from Russia&amp;ndash;was killed by a rock dropped from an overpass over I-64 as she returned home from work late one evening.</description>

Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s eldest daughter, Bristol, is pregnant and will marry Levi, the child&amp;rsquo;s father, Todd and Sarah said today in a press release [FoxNews.com].
 The 17-year-old unwed daughter of John McCainâs new running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, is five-months pregnant, Palin and her husband, Todd Palin, said Monday in a written statement.
 McCainâs campaign told FOX News that the presumptive Republican presidential candidate knew about Bristol Palinâs pregnancy before he chose Palin as his running mate last Friday, and that Bristol is planning to marry the father of her child.</description>

      <description>CNN (TV, not .com) just reported that the Industrial Levee in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans has ruptured under the strain of water and wind, flooding homes and streets throughout the same area that was devastated by Katrina.
The Army Corps of Engineers&amp;rsquo; latest release said that levees were overtopped, relieving some pressure, but all levees were holding. It&amp;rsquo;s possible that the CNN&amp;rsquo;s reporters doesn&amp;rsquo;t know the definition of a breech.</description>

      <description>Every mention of Sarah Palin produced a banner-waving roar from the crowd of over 20,000 in T. R. Hughes Stadium in O&amp;rsquo;Fallon, Missouri, on blistering hot Sunday afternoon.Â While McCain is on top of the ticket, Palin is the draw.
A woman from Dent County&amp;ndash;about 3 hours from O&amp;rsquo;Fallon&amp;ndash;made the drive to see McCain and Palin in person.Â She was thrilled to get hold of a &amp;ldquo;McCain-Palin&amp;rdquo; banner after several stacks of the banners didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to her.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll have photos and a report on the events this evening.

      <description>On Thursday, the Washington Post gleefully reported that the GOP couldn&amp;rsquo;t give away tickets to McCain&amp;rsquo;s scheduled pre-convention rallies in Dayton, Ohio, Pittsburgh, PA, and O&amp;rsquo;Fallon, MO.
That ended with the announcement of Palin as is VP choice.
In St. Louis, tickets disappeared so quickly (and the distribution method was so lame-brained) that even donors and party activists with guaranteed reservations lost their reservations. The party decided to give away reserved tickets to meet the clamorous demand at the doors of various ticket locations (which is going to royally piss off my son Patrick when he finds out they gave away our tickets).</description>

They&amp;rsquo;re calling KMOX Radio in St. Louis to give the &amp;ldquo;bad mother&amp;rdquo; mantra.Â Here&amp;rsquo;s the line:Â What kind of a woman would leave a newborn and 3 young daughters behind while she campaigns for Vice President of the United States?Â [caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_8689&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;240&amp;rdquo; caption=&amp;quot;McCain*Palin&amp;rdquo;][/caption]

Â [caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_8683&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;rdquo; caption=&amp;quot;Brilliant!&amp;quot;][/caption]
Sarah Palin may not be the perfect pick for VP, but she&amp;rsquo;s the most perfect available. By selecting a (hot) working class mother of five with strong conservative principles and a record of putting the people before parties and pricnipalities, John McCain has proven, again, to be the most effective Republican campaigner since Reagan.</description>

His self-aggrandizementÂ borders on pathological. He alone will defend Israel. He alone will stop 4 billion years of climate change. He alone will provide health insurance to every man, woman, and child. The economy never had a negative growth quarter, but he sees a recession. Perhaps that recession comes from the emptiness of rhetoric.</description>

      <description>When you get down to it, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what Obama says tomorrow night, or how he says it. Americans will vote for what he is. What Obama is can be summed up in a single, offensive word. Later.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what we know about Obama vis-a-vis the job of Commander in Chief: * No military experience * No business experience * Best friends are terrorists and racists * Believes in socialism over capitalism * Meglomaniacal fascination with himself * Wife hates America, except when America gives her cash * Funnels money to radicals in exchange for political favors * Made over $4 million last year and claims to hate the rich * Want&amp;rsquo;s to double the average American family&amp;rsquo;s tax burden * Hires mafia thugs to intimidate Republican rivals * Smokes and tells us not to * He&amp;rsquo;s not particularly smart, but he pretends to be in speeches * Lies about his political past, his personal past, his intentions * Lacks the spine to stand up for what he actually believes in So what&amp;rsquo;s that one word?</description>

      <description>According to Stanley Kurtz, one of a handful of reports allowed to see the Ayers Papers at University of Illinois, Chicago, &amp;ldquo;Our worst fears were confirmed.&amp;rdquo; Radical terrorist William Ayers, founder of the Weathermen and theÂ Woods Fund of Chicago, appointed Obama as one of three directors of the &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo; project in 1995. In exchange for the appointment and the right use it as street cred in his first political campaign, Obama voted to siphon funds intended for public school education programs into Ayers&amp;rsquo;s radical political organizations.</description>

      <description>Michelle Malkin reports that Barack Obama has asked the US Justice Department to incarcerate a Republican donor in Texas for the high crime of . . . donating money to Republicans.
This guy is as red as Stalin. Don&amp;rsquo;t think for a moment that, if Obama wins, the RNC&amp;rsquo;s donor list will be scrutinized and big donors prosecuted.

      <description>I listened to Hillary&amp;rsquo;s speech at the DNC in my car driving home from Strategic Planning class. First, I was struck by what a terrible speaker she is. Without the art and artifice of the convention hall, choreographed cameras, and wide shots of adoring fans, speakers are left with only their tone, pitch, inflection, volume, thoughts, ideas, and syntax to carry the message. Hillary Clinton lacked them all.
Her speech seemed short.</description>

Meanwhile, Obama has asked the Department of Justice to block ads that link the Illinois Senator to domestic terrorist William Ayers. Pathetic.
 Obamaâs campaign has written the Department of Justice demanding a criminal investigation of the âAmerican Issues Project,â the vehicle through which Dallas investor Harold Simmons is financing the advertisements.</description>

 Supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton are furiously circulating petitions on the floor of the Democratic National Convention tonight, hoping to stave off a plan to hold the convention&amp;rsquo;s roll call at breakfast Wednesday â out of the public eye â sources inside the delegations say.</description>

      <description>A fe months ago, only conservatives and Republicans were talking about Obama&amp;rsquo;s arrogance.Â Now, everyone&amp;rsquo;s noticing it.
 Something about Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s manner bothers Margaret Cowan.
 &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s something egotistical about him,&amp;rdquo; the Sheridan, Colo., retiree said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the way he struts around.&amp;rdquo;
Many swing voters here and throughout the country consider the presumptive Democratic nominee distant, pompous, arrogant, even elitist. [Kansas City Star]
  Democrat consultants say Obama&amp;rsquo;s arrogance is a real issue that needs to be addressed.</description>

The McCain campaign&amp;rsquo;s marketing brilliance continues to amaze. I had no idea he would be this adept at modern campaigning. With this ad, McCain will foment the still-simmering anger among Clinton&amp;rsquo;s most loyal supporters, as demonstrated in this Washington Times article.</description>

Wow. Smart, smart man. Only . . . most colleges don&amp;rsquo;t have an IQ requirement. George W. Bush has degrees from Yale and Harvard, but his IQ is, like, 28 according to Biden. I guess whatever schools Biden went to, they give diplomas based on IQ instead of credit hours.</description>

ABC News&amp;rsquo;s Jake Tapper spent his Saturday morning documenting some of Joe Biden&amp;rsquo;s dumbest moments. (It&amp;rsquo;s long.)Â My favorite came from a Biden 1988 campaign ad in which he seemed to anticipate Obama&amp;rsquo;s candidacy:
 &amp;ldquo;The White House isn&amp;rsquo;t the place to learn how to deal with international crisis, the balance of power, war and peace, and the economic future of the next generation,&amp;rdquo; said a TV ad for Sen.</description>

Because Biden was the party&amp;rsquo;s choice, not Obama&amp;rsquo;s.
Obama wanted a young candidate, a liberal, who would make Obama look stronger, older, weightier.</description>

American&amp;rsquo;s trust McCain more than 3 to 1 over Obama.
That&amp;rsquo;s big.
 If you had to make the âtoughest decisionâ of your life, who would you rather get advice from â Obama or McCain?
 Based on that question, there are signs that undecided voters may be more inclined to move to McCain than to Obama.</description>

Everybodyâs watching whatâs going on in Beijing right now with the Olympics. Think about the amount of money that China has spent on infrastructure. Their ports, their train systems, their airports are vastly the superior to us now, which means if you are a corporation deciding where to do business youâre starting to think, âBeijing looks like a pretty good option.</description>

They were wrong.Â So was I.
Somehow, McCain staged a masterful comeback, and I use the word &amp;ldquo;masterful&amp;rdquo; advisedly.Â His comeback was not spectacular or flamboyant or even memorable.Â It was quiet, consistent, and strong.</description>

      <description>Rush Limbaugh came close, today, to a telling insight into the left&amp;rsquo;s love of Obama. He finished short. Let me complete Rush&amp;rsquo;s thought: The left worship Obama hoping for absolution and salvation.
Absolution is a big thing to a Catholic. It&amp;rsquo;s the difference between Heaven and Hell. Absolution comes only from God through His son Jesus Christ&amp;rsquo;s death and resurrection. The Messiah paved the way.
The left&amp;rsquo;s deification of Obama stands on its own.</description>

      <description>Maybe I didn&amp;rsquo;t overreact last week.Â According to the Washington Post on the scene in Gori, Republic of Georgia, Soviet Russian troops are &amp;ldquo;digging&amp;rdquo; for a long offensive or occupation:
 Russia pledged Sunday to begin removing its troops from Georgia on Monday, but the streets of this occupied city reflected a broadening, not a waning, of Russia&amp;rsquo;s military incursion.
 . . .
During a reporter&amp;rsquo;s 24-hour stay in the city this weekend, Russian soldiers roamed the streets in armored personnel carriers and waved Kalashnikov rifles to prevent entry to a captured Georgian military base that is now the Russian headquarters.</description>

      <description>The day after John McCain handed Barack Obama his ass on a platter at the Saddleback Forum, Obama&amp;rsquo;s paid mouthpiece, Andrea Mitchell, accused McCain of cheating (see Newsbusters).Â I guess going mano-a-mano with a real man is above Obama&amp;rsquo;s paygrade, too.
How pathetically consistent.Â Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s childishness, immaturity, and lack of accountability grow to new legendary heights every passing day.Â I really don&amp;rsquo;t know how people can take this brat seriously.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve had a week to look at our two presidential candidates&amp;rsquo; handling of the largest foreign policy incident so far this campaign.Â In this crisis, we saw theÂ difference between a strong man and an insecure boy.
John McCain, who warned us a long time ago that President Bush&amp;rsquo;s evaluation of Putin was naive, called the matter right from the start, according Jim Wooten in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Â McCain, who once said that he looked into Putin&amp;rsquo;s eyes and saw &amp;ldquo;a &amp;lsquo;K&amp;rsquo;, a &amp;lsquo;G&amp;rsquo;, and a &amp;lsquo;B&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rdquo;Â held one, single, defining position throughout the crisis:</description>

Nazario and his brothers who have been coerced into testifying against him by the rogue Federal Persecutor, Jerry Behnke. I&amp;rsquo;ve made my donation; please make yours today. Federal prosecutors, emboldened by leftist anti-military groups, will persecute a former Marine for alleged murder committed while he was on active duty in Iraq.
 A former Marine sergeant facing the first federal civilian prosecution of a military member accused of a war crime says there is much more at stake than his claim of innocence on charges that he killed unarmed detainees in Fallujah, Iraq.</description>

      <description>To say Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s intellectual stamina is weak is like saying Georgia&amp;rsquo;s a bad vacation destination right now.Â (Georgia the republic, not the state.)
Under the brilliant title &amp;ldquo;Obama&amp;rsquo;s Paygrade = E-0&amp;rdquo; comes this:
 Last night the Obama was asked when an unborn child got legal rights. Like the spineless political tool he is he refused to answer stating that it was above his pay grade. The reason his answer matters is that he supports abortion on demand even when a child accidentally survives and lives outside the womb.</description>

      <description>Everytime I&amp;rsquo;ve debated the death penalty with a bleeding-heart, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this question:Â &amp;ldquo;Would you pull the switch&amp;rdquo; or its equal.Â It&amp;rsquo;s only fair to turn the question on them.
Barack Obama, if you read this blog, please answer this question:Â Would you kill child who survived an abortion with your own hands?Â (Thanks to Jill Stanek viaÂ Michelle Malkin)
 Barack Obama, as chairman of an IL state Senate committee, voted down a bill to protect live-born survivors of abortion - even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language, copied from a federal bill passed by Congress without objection in 2002, explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion.</description>

 Russian forces swept across Georgia on Monday, capturing the town of Gori and moving to within 35 miles of the capital city Tbilisi, FOX News confirmed.
 This is very serious stuff.Â Russia&amp;rsquo;s expansionist intentions are as obvious as they were in the Prague Spring and the Hungarian Revolt.</description>

      <description>Steve McIntyre tears to shreds an anti-speech ruling by the British equivalent of the FCC, Ofcom.Â Ofcom ruled that a documentary &amp;ldquo;The Great Global Warming Swindle&amp;rdquo; violated rules, essentially, because the producers presented evidence contrary to the party line of the United Nations and the Labor government. In other words, in the UK, thou shalt not question global warming.

      <description>While my flaming headline (&amp;quot;Dr. James Hansen of GISS is a Liar and Fraud&amp;quot;) received a fair amount of attention, people a lot smarter than I are carefully documenting the facts that led to my unavoidable conclusion.
One such appears on the Telegraph today.Â Christopher Booker (corrected link) notes that Dr. Hansen&amp;rsquo;s GISS center is alone in seeing continued warming throughout the world.Â Pointing out that laws supported by Hansen, Al Gore, and others will cost tens of trillions of dollars and severely limit freedoms throughout the world for the generations, Booker rightly contends that those proposing such a retreat from liberty be damn well sure they&amp;rsquo;re right.</description>

 U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said in an interview published on Saturday the size of a residual U.</description>

      <description>TigerHawk decided to fact-check Obama&amp;rsquo;s pontifical address to his German subjects concerning the messiah&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;facts&amp;rdquo; about global warming (h/t Hackbarth).Â Like Hansen and Gore, Obama enjoys lying to the people.Â TigerHawk shows academic research that report sea levels falling, not rising, and Kansas not in a drought, but normal to exceptionally moist.
I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised to catch Obama in a lie; I am surprised that people continue to lie about global warming despite all scientific evidence (not doctored byJames Hansen) to the contrary.</description>

      <description>Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s most conspicuous quality, if you want to call it that, is shameless arrogance. His trip abroad was like Hitler&amp;rsquo;s tour of Italy in 1938.Â Before you dismiss my view as that of a party hack tearing down the opposition, read Susan Estrich&amp;rsquo;s column on FoxNews.com. (Estrich was Michael Dukakis&amp;rsquo;s campaign manager in 1988).
First, Presidential candidates rarely campaign in war zones, and for good reason.Â American politics traditionally sort of stopped &amp;ldquo;at the water&amp;rsquo;s edge,&amp;rdquo; as the saying went.</description>

 Topping it all, Hansen has allegedly received hundreds of thousands of additional dollars to further politicize the issue of global warming.Â According to Investors Business Daily, &amp;ldquo;How many people, for instance, know that James Hansen, a man billed as a lonely âNASA whistleblower&amp;rsquo; standing up to the mighty U.S. government, was really funded by [George] Soros&amp;rsquo; Open Society Institute (OSI), which gave him âlegal and media advice&amp;rsquo;?</description>

Not anymore.

      <description>Rasmussen&amp;rsquo;s presidential tracking poll shows a dead heat between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican Presidential Candidate John McCain (h/t Drudge).Â This poll confirms the Newsweek poll showing the two in a statistical dead heat.
Moreover, according Rasmussen, McCain enjoys higher favorability ratings than Obama.
Considering that McCain has received little media attention since the last Democrat primary in June, Obama&amp;rsquo;s 15 percentage point drop can only be blamed on Obama&amp;rsquo;s dismal performance as a candidate.</description>

      <description>Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s poll lead over John McCain has plummeted from 51-35 to a statistical dead-heat in less than a month.
Obama&amp;rsquo;s downward spiral has Newsweek&amp;rsquo;s headline writers asking if his glow is fading. The polls finds that more than half of voters consider Obama lying opportunist who will take any position for votes.
 Obama&amp;rsquo;s rapid drop comes at a strategically challenging moment for the Democratic candidate. Having vanquished Hillary Clinton in early June, Obama quickly went about repositioning himself for a general-election audience&amp;ndash;an unpleasant task for any nominee emerging from the pander-heavy primary contests and particularly for a candidate who&amp;rsquo;d slogged through a vigorous primary challenge in most every contest from January until June.</description>

      <title>Antarctic Ice Anomaly At All-Time High</title>

      <description>According University of Illinois&amp;rsquo;s Cryosphere Today, Antarctic sea ice is at an all-time high. (Yeah, I know &amp;ldquo;all-time&amp;rdquo; is relative, since records go back only 30 years. But the alarmists have no issue with treating 30 years as the sum of recorded history; why should I?)
Â   
On the other hand, Arctic sea ice had a bad week. Mounting evidence points to underwater volcanoes pumping superheated water toward the bottom of the ice as the major problem, but the hysteriacs will blame my cigarette smoke.</description>

      <title>The Greenhousers--At Least They Have Pluck</title>

      <description>Despite all scientific evidence now denying the greenhouse hypothesis, the greenhousers stand by their story. That story: global temperatures will continue to rise in direct proportion to the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere and for many years after CO2 emissions stop altogether resulting mass famine, flooding, death, and the Cubs winning the World Series.
Unfortunately for Al Gore, the past year saw almost every tenet, speculation, and idea about greenhouse gasses and man-made global warming fall to the scrutiny of science: * The Tree Ring theory upon which Mann relied was proven wrong, as tree leaves maintain a constant internal temperature of 21.</description>

      <description>The Associated Press, long upset that people often quote and link to its stories on the internet, has imposed a $2.50 per word fee for bloggers who wish to quote one of its stories.
I understand. It&amp;rsquo;s tough to have a lot of people driving web traffic to your site. Considering the number of articles attributed to the AP, the cost of servers and bandwidth must be outrageous.
But I have a solution: Stop posting stories on the internet.</description>

As CO2 levels increase in the atmosphere, so does vegetation. Why? Plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. WattsUpWithThat

All talk was about the Democrat race: blacks have come far; Clintons have fallen farther. It struck me that the pundits&amp;ndash;liberal Democrats all&amp;ndash;seemed to have forgotten that another vote happens in November. Instead of deep analysis of the McCain-Obama face-off, Andrea Mitchell and Tim Russert were handicapping Obama&amp;rsquo;s cabinet picks.

      <description>Part I
The sun is the source and cause of all weather. The aggregate of weather is climate. When the sun changes, climate changes.
These are irrefutable truths of science, even though Dr. Mann, Al Gore, and the global warming hysteriacs skipped that chapter in their science books.
Part II
The downside of global cooling, or ice ages, is far worse for humanity and most species of fish, plants, and animals than the worst predictions of global warming.</description>

      <description>The global warming hoax of the past decade, which reached a climax in 2006-2007, is in rapid decline. I&amp;rsquo;m no longer the only one noticing it. Add to that the news of a couple weeks back that no one in an ABC News poll of 1,197 US adults named Global Warming as an issue in this year&amp;rsquo;s elections. No one. Nada. Zip. Ain&amp;rsquo;t huntin&amp;rsquo;.
In desperation, then, Al Gore today pronounced the Myanmar Hurricane a result of non-existent global warming.</description>

      <description>Michelle Malkin points out a skit on YouTube by comedian Damon Wayans: Abortionman. Michelle asks:
Is Wayans really trying to send an anti-abortion message here? Or is this just sophomoric, exploitative garbage masquerading as faux social criticism?
I&amp;rsquo;m a hyperbolist, myself, so I tend to see this as sophomoric anti-abortion speech. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s exploitive: it exploits those who treat infanticide as a coin-flip decision. It exploits the moronic pro-abortion arguments the dehumanize unborn children.</description>

      <description>Every modern man knows that invalidating a woman&amp;rsquo;s feelings lies on the offensiveness scale somewhere between unwelcomed groping and fat jokes. Whether or not it&amp;rsquo;s fair to suffer a woman&amp;rsquo;s wrath because she misunderstood a word is another matter.
Last week, Barack Obama smugly told a group of billionaire liberals in San Francisco that rural Americans are bitter, ignorant Neanderthals who prefer guns and superstitions (aka, religion) and race-hatred to reason, education, and hard work.</description>

The Boxmasters combine the English Invasion with 60s hillbilly music to form &amp;ldquo;electric hillbilly.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s heavy on steel guitar, which gives all their songs the twang that screams &amp;ldquo;old country.&amp;rdquo; I love the sound.

Since the Rev.

But most politicians dodge blame. What demonstrates Obama&amp;rsquo;s remarkable lack of courage was his direct dealings with a man he professes to love: the Rev.</description>

The brilliant Anthony Watts has uncovered some old newspapers from 1922 and 1933 that prove my point very well. From the Washington Post of November 2, 1922, we learn that the death of the Arctic ice cap was nigh:
 The Arctic ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot, according to a report to the Commerce Department yesterday from Consul Ifft, at Bergen, Norway.</description>

      <description>No matter how painful, eventually you must go into his room. Each book on the shelves, every dirty sock strewn carelessly on the floor in anticipation of picking it up tomorrow, the odd angle of the pillow on the bed, and the scent&amp;ndash;oh, God, above all the scent&amp;ndash;remind you both of the life and of its passing. Still, you must open the door, for his passing didn&amp;rsquo;t relieve you of your duties.</description>

I was never a huge Oprah Winfrey fan, but learning that she chooses an anti-American racist as her minister poisoned whatever good feelings I might have had for her.
Differences between races because of cultural histories are certain. Oprah and Obama, though, demonstrate, in their allegiance to Reverend Wright, a moral corruption that cannot be papered over with soothing rhetoric or million dollar giveaways.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s fatwa from the new pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, the separatist and anti-American church in which Barack Obama bends his knee, places a pivotal decision before the senator: he is either with them or against them.
The church, whose manifesto and pastor spoke indefensible words of separatism and hate, could have taken its lumps, reformed, and move on. Instead, under the direction of the Reverend Otis Moss II, it came out swinging.</description>

      <description>If America still has a serious racial divide, then black preachers may be the chief perpetuators.
The Power of the Black Pulpit
The preacher is a powerful, revered figured in black Christian communities (Jones, 1989). Good families teach their children to learn from and emulate the preacher&amp;rsquo;s words and actions. According to Kirk Byron Jones,
 The roots of black preachers&amp;rsquo; prerogative and power are in the soils of African religion and American racism.</description>

      <description>My Way News - Obama Decries Racial Rhetoric
 Sen. Barack Obama on Saturday decried &amp;ldquo;the forces of division&amp;rdquo; over race that he said are intruding into the Democratic presidential nomination contest.
 Remember that Jeremiah Wright is Barack&amp;rsquo;s spiritual advisor of 20 years. So,isn&amp;rsquo;t this a matter of the pot calling the kettle . . . African-American?

 Lacking a clear route to the selection of a Democratic presidential nominee, the party&amp;rsquo;s uncommitted superdelegates say they are growing increasingly concerned about the risks of a prolonged fight between Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, and perplexed about how to resolve the conflict.

      <description>Ace of Spades describes this breaking story as &amp;ldquo;nuclear&amp;rdquo; for the Obama campaign. I agree.
Obama&amp;rsquo;s only defense in the Rev. Jeremiah Wright scandal was to claim he never heard vitriol spew from Wright&amp;rsquo;s mouth. Many pundits, including Obama supporters, warned that any evidence putting Obama in that church during an ant-US, anti-white hate sermon would be Obama&amp;rsquo;s undoing. He&amp;rsquo;d be a proven petty liar.
Looks like he is:
  Wright laced into America&amp;rsquo;s establishment, blaming the &amp;ldquo;white arrogance&amp;rdquo; of America&amp;rsquo;s Caucasian majority for the woes of the world, especially the oppression suffered by blacks.</description>

 It&amp;rsquo;s Obama 46% Clinton 45%** **(see recent daily results). This reflects an unusually sharp change from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s results when Obama led by eight points and reached the 50% level of support for the first time.
 That&amp;rsquo;s really bad news for Obama. If either of these stories ever reaches the front pages of a newspaper, he might need to work on his withdrawal speech.</description>

 it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely clear why al Qaeda is so desperate to avoid a President McCain. I suppose there&amp;rsquo;s some propaganda value to a female president that could be exploited; if anything, the opposite would be true in the case of a President Obama.

 In a Feb. 28 letter, FARC chieftain Raul Reyes cheerily reported to his inner circle that he met &amp;ldquo;two gringos&amp;rdquo; who assured him &amp;ldquo;the new president of their country will be Obama and that they are interested in your compatriots.</description>

When Drs. Marshall and Warren discovered that ulcers were primarily caused by bacterial infection, the scientific consensus was to deprive them of their licenses to practice medicine. One hundred percent of gastro-intestinal physicians and researches agreed that over-production of acid caused stomach ulcers.</description>

I read the lengthy New York Times story about Obama&amp;rsquo;s uselessness in the US Senate yesterday. I was too confused to write. Could it be that NYT &amp;ndash; the liberalest of liberal papers, the international bastion of anti-Americanism, the newspaper of fraud and everything unholy &amp;ndash; was calling Obama a waste of Senate oxygen?</description>

      <description>Karl Roves cites three possible affects of the prolonged Democrat nomination process on John McCain&amp;rsquo;s chances:
  Clinton and Obama bloody each other, leaving the Democrats with a &amp;ldquo;damaged goods&amp;rdquo; candidate for the general election.
  The excitement of a brokered convention draws millions of sideliners into the political process, mostly on the Democrat side, giving whoever wins that party&amp;rsquo;s nomination a leg up.
  The protracted race pushes McCain off the front pages, allowing the Democrats to define McCain in any light they choose.</description>

Something happened on the way to the coronation: the truth hit Barack Obama square in the face.
Noam Scheiber of The New Republic previously dismissed the NAFTA-Canuk story, now admits the story has legs:
 Two things make it problematic for the Obama campaign: 1.) The sudden appearance of this lurid-sounding memo written by a Canadian consular official. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s particularly revealing&amp;ndash;as I said this morning, it reflects what the Canadians thought they heard from Goolsbee; there are, significantly, no direct quotes.</description>

      <description>The Catholic Church is often wrongly accused of suppressing science throughout the so-called Dark Ages. Legend has it that the Church used her secular influence over divine-right monarchs to thwart scientific inquiry.
It&amp;rsquo;s all hooey, of course. During the Medieval period, the lack of an economic system that generated surplus left the Church alone to advance science, translate texts, and preserve history.
But that&amp;rsquo;s a different story.
Al Gore and his band of merry thought police are doing to science what the left claims the church did&amp;ndash;slitting the throats of anyone who dares speak heresies against the Global Warming god.</description>

Chavez is a Stalinist, and Stalin founded and expanded the Soviet Union with a combination of force, threats, and promises. Every Soviet student expects Chavez to follow suit.
 President Hugo Chavez on Sunday ordered 10 battalions of troops to the border with Colombia after Colombia&amp;rsquo;s military killed a top rebel leader.
He called the U.S.-allied government in Bogota &amp;ldquo;a terrorist state&amp;rdquo; and labeled President Alvaro Uribe &amp;ldquo;a criminal.</description>

In a debate, Obama said he would deploy troops back into Iraq, after a pullout, if al Qaeda established bases. (Do I really need to point out the lack of intelligence, understanding, and strategy his comment portrays?)
McCain responded by saying, &amp;ldquo;I have news for Senator Obama, al Qaeda is in Iraq, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re fighting in Iraq.</description>

They&amp;rsquo;ve done it.
McCain was the &amp;ldquo;media darling&amp;rdquo; candidate only until all other candidates fell out. That fall out came with this week&amp;rsquo;s primaries. Today, the very media that built up McCain and propelled him to the Republican nomination tore him down.</description>

 White people love to laugh, so it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that some of the funniest people in the world are white!
 But there&amp;rsquo;s more:
 WARNING: under no circumstances should you EVER list Dane Cook as your favorite comedian. The wrong kind of white people like him.</description>

      <description>When your children die at the hands of terrorists, blame the Democrats and their lawyer friends.
Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and other Democrats let the domestic surveillance law die. They did it because their Trial Lawyer donors want to sue telecommunication companies who help stop terrorism.
It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to count the number of American lives saved by electronic surveillance. We know it&amp;rsquo;s in the thousands. Possibly the hundreds of thousands.</description>

      <description>Clinton Inc. will do whatever (it thinks) it takes to secure the Democrat nomination for president.
The news of the past two days has been Obama&amp;rsquo;s plagiarism.Â As if Obama is can&amp;rsquo;t produce his own pandering drivel.Â From WaPo:
 Yesterday, key Clinton supporters accused Obama of &amp;ldquo;lifting&amp;rdquo; a passage of the rousing speech he delivered to a party gathering in Milwaukee on Saturday night from Massachusetts Gov. Deval L. Patrick, a longtime friend and supporter.</description>

      <description>The Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer in Latin intrigues me. I think it&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s so easily understood to speakers of English.
This is a prayer to memorize, even if you&amp;rsquo;re not a Latin Mass type. The rhythm of the language is soothing, and the words begin to take on a higher meaning.</description>

      <description>I am disheartened that James Joyner continues to find more fault with conservatives&amp;rsquo; reasons and methods for attacking a socialist than with the socialist himself.
  In the growing debate over a Che Guevara Cuban flag proudly adorning the wall of Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s headquarters in Houston, Texas, Joyner comes galloping to Obama&amp;rsquo;s defense, ignoring the mounting evidence that Obama is as every bit as much a threat to capitalism as is Hugo Chavez.</description>

      <description>The New York Times on Tuesday will carry story describing the Hillary Clinton campaign as a death-watch (h/t Drudge).
It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that on January 7, I wrote the Kerry campaign obituary prematurely.Â Still, the problems Hillary faces are of the sort that spells doom to candidates, either in their nomination quest or, later, in the general election.Â Shuffling top staff, borrowing money from the candidate, asking staff to work without pay are all symptoms of a campaign in deep trouble.</description>

      <description>Imagine the affect on Allied troop morale, planning, and espionage had US troops found Hitler&amp;rsquo;s diary during the Normandy invasion.
Something close, in the strategic sense, happened recently in Iraq. US fighters seized the diary of an al Qaeda in Iraq leader. The journal provides our side with names of terrorists, descriptions of their tactics, evidence of their atrocities, and catalogs of their weapons.
Just as important, though, the book proves that we are winning and the terrorists are losing.</description>

A foot of snow reflected brilliant white sunlight on a sixty-degree day that seemed more like Colorado than Missouri. But our location was obvious by the unmistakable eagles-in-As adorning every fixture at the Anheuser-Busch Center in southwest St. Louis County.
I cherish every Hennessy family get-together, but this one was special. There was no funeral parlor to visit, no Rosary at 10:00 p.</description>

      <description>If John McCain (or Huckster) is the Republican nominee, why would anyone, other than GOP loyalists, vote Republican?
To paraphrase Harry Truman, if McCain (or Huckster) is the nominee, there won&amp;rsquo;t be a dime&amp;rsquo;s difference between the two parties. Given that, why not vote for the real deal in Hillary or Obama? McCain is an impostor.Â (Related:Â Michelle Malkin asks ifÂ the GOP is lost.)
Ronald Reagan won because he was sooooooo different from the Democrats that conservative Democrats and independents exercised the freedom of political choice and crossed over to our side.</description>

I planned to vote on my way home from work. I have a client-facing job, and I have to respond to production issues. Tonight&amp;rsquo;s issue lasted until 6:10. Then, either local flooding or a bad accident had a major road to my house closed. It took over 45 minutes to get through the detour. By that time, it was 7:00 p.m., and my polling place in Ellisville, Missouri, was closed.</description>

      <description>Former Sentator and Republican nominee for President, Bob Dole, came to John McCain&amp;rsquo;s defense, today.Â Taking umbrage at anti-McCain rhetoric from conservatives like Rush Limbaugh, Dole struck back, declaring McCain a superior candidate.Â Here is the text of Dole&amp;rsquo;s message:
 When Bob Dole ran for president, Bob Dole lost to an unpopular, scandal-ridden Democrat who had just lost both houses of Congress in an off-year Republican landslide.

Yahoo! calls Belichick a &amp;ldquo;sore loser.&amp;rdquo; 
 Because Bill Belichick wanted to go hide when he lost, the field ended up being flooded with people, and the officials had to clear the area before the Giants could take their final snap and make it official. When you lose, you take your loss. You don&amp;rsquo;t leave early because it makes you feel sad inside. Your opponent deserves more respect than that.</description>

Cede Berkeley, California, to the Taliban.

      <description>Back in the 1980s, it was fashionable for the left to scoff at Reagan&amp;rsquo;s economic notion that a rising tide lifts all ships. Liberal economists and politicians sneeringly referred to &amp;ldquo;trickle-down&amp;rdquo; economics as a justification for the rich to keep the poor poor. Every responsible economist knew Reagan was right, but the left in America had no accountability. Many Americans, by 1986, believed &amp;ldquo;trickle-down&amp;rdquo; economics pure evil.
Today, MSNBC took it all back.</description>

I am heartbroken that Fred Thompson ended his race. I am discouraged that he had to end it. The only Reagan conservative&amp;ndash;well, Reagan-style conservative&amp;ndash;in the race is gone.Â My best to Fred and his family.
That leaves us with McCain (moderate) and Romney (smarmy).

      <description>America, and the world, could be looking at the worst recession since the &amp;rsquo;70s and early &amp;rsquo;80s. (Coincidentally, the last recession began simultaneously with the end of an 8 year presidency.Â The one before that was pretty close, too.)Â I remember that era.
Only the unions and the remnants of employer-worker loyalty saved my neighbors from prolonged unemployment and foreclosure. St. Louis firms tried hard to keep their doors open. We know it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so good in other industrial cities: Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Milwaukee, southern Pennsylvania.</description>

      <description>In an interview certain to shock Democrats who believe Bill Clinton a paragon of truthfulness and honesty, Democrat candidate Barack Obama has accused Bill Clinton of lying, according to ABC News.
 &amp;ldquo;You know the former president, who I think all of us have a lot of regard for, has taken his advocacy on behalf of his wife to a level that I think is pretty troubling,&amp;rdquo; Obama said. &amp;ldquo;He continues to make statements that are not supported by the facts &amp;ndash; whether it&amp;rsquo;s about my record of opposition to the war in Iraq or our approach to organizing in Las Vegas.</description>

 &amp;ldquo;We went to Turkey. When we got over there, we rented a car and we drove all the way to Budapest. By the time we got to Budapest it was like the Cannes Film Festival, I&amp;rsquo;d never seen anything like it,&amp;rdquo; Theron told the Mail.</description>

      <description>With his third place finish in South Carolina, a lot of us are just waiting for the announcement from Fred Thompson that the race, for him, is over.
Charles Bird blogs on RedState that Thompson should do the honorable thing by dropping out and endorsing McCain. McCain, in turn, would return the favor naming Thompson his running mate if nominated.
 Thompson has enough support from social and economic conservatives to bring us a solid base going forward, especially if Thompson is a presumptive running mate.</description>

      <description>The polls in South Carolina closed 52 minutes ago, and ABC News projects that John McCain and Mike Huckebee will finish first and second (or second and first) with Fred Thompson battling Mitt Romney for third.
A third place finish could spell the end for Thompson and hopes for a conservative Republican candidate in 2008. A win for McCain could put the Arizona Senator and former POW on a wave that would carry him to the nomination&amp;ndash;and a brutal defeat in November.</description>

      <description>MSNBC projects Mitt Romney will win the Nevada Caucuses, topping Mike Huckabee, Fred Thompson, and Ron &amp;ldquo;Hell Yes I&amp;rsquo;m Nuts&amp;rdquo; Paul.
I have to admit, I paid absolutely no attention to recent polls in Nevada. South Carolina is where the action is, where my attention has been, and where my head and heart lie. South Carolina is where Fred Thompson, the conservative candidate for President, makes his stand.

      <description>The most recent three polls from South Carolina demonstrate one thing clearly:Â you can&amp;rsquo;t believe polls.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the latest from RealClearPolitics.Â The spreads and the leaders are so out of whack, so changing, that no one can draw any intelligent conclusions.
While McCain&amp;rsquo;s number is static at about 26, Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s numbers fluctuate wildly.Â Romney and Paul are steadily falling, while our hero Thompson rises steadily.
Let&amp;rsquo;s hope more Huckabee supporters break for Fred in the next 24 hours.</description>

 &amp;ldquo;Once this reaches the general population, it will be truly unstoppable,&amp;rdquo; said Binh Diep, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco who led the study.</description>

 &amp;ldquo;Armed men entered the school in Beit Lahiya during the night and ransacked rooms as well as adminstration offices, and stole several computers.&amp;rdquo;
 Nasty fucks.Â I&amp;rsquo;ll bet George Soros finances this act of terrorism, too.
 The raid on the school was the second in a week. On Wednesday armed men fired anti-tank rockets at it, causing serious damage to the building.</description>

What other conclusion can we draw after learning, to no surprise, the Soros funded the fictitious Lancet report of 650,000 Iraqi deaths&amp;ndash;a report since dismissed by everyone from the DNC to the United Nations.
From London&amp;rsquo;s TimesOnline:
 A STUDY that claimed 650,000 people were killed as a result of the invasion of Iraq was partly funded by the antiwar billionaire George Soros.</description>

His crime, according to the Commission, was publishing the famous Mohammed cartoons that originally appeared in a Danish Magazine.
Levant was ordered against his will to appear before the Commission on Friday, January 10. He began with a compelleing opening statement that made the Commission sound like a collection of Nazi boobs hellbent on destroying the right of political speech and to advance the cause of radical Islam in Canada.</description>

From the clip I blogged below, I have to give points to Romney for slamming Ron Paul. As a war hero, John McCain had every right to across the stage and belt that phony, lying, racist scum.</description>

      <description>Mitt Romney is pulling his broadcast advertising from South Carolina and Florida (h/t Drudge).
This could help Fred&amp;rsquo;s Fort Sumter strategy.Â I might have been wrong about Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s descent, as he seems to remain above 20 percent in key states.Â By conceding South Carolina, though, Romney may end up driving soft supporters to Thompson, and that might be his strategy.
With McCain, the media darling, rising, Romney could hope to bump up Thompson&amp;rsquo;s numbers in the Palmetto State.</description>

**The Obama Years **
To be fair, Jimmy Carter inherited a country that needed a lot of work.
Lyndon Johnson&amp;rsquo;s Great Society programs, built on Roosevelt&amp;rsquo;s economically untenable New Deal welfare state, had set the nation&amp;rsquo;s economy and social classes on a path to destruction a decade earlier.Â The self-absorption of the Baby Boomers decayed the social institutions and mores that sustained us for 200 years.</description>

But the children, like Oprah, croon.
Why do I say this? How am I qualified to say, as I did on Saturday, that four years of Obama will look much like the four years of Carter?</description>

      <description>Many of you don&amp;rsquo;t remember 1984. I was a junior in college, campaigning for Reagan, on campus and off. For those of you who weren&amp;rsquo;t around then, I can tell that even gray, rainy days were brighter than than sunniest June sky had been in 1979.
Nothing expresses the change in America better than this classic. Brought to you by the Republicans.

      <description>After tonight&amp;rsquo;s 90 minutes with the Republicans, I can say without any fear of error whatsoever that Fred Dalton Thompson is the most qualified person in either party to run the United States of America. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:
 * Thompson understands the philosophical foundations on which this country was born and became the greatest nation on earth * Thompson&#39;s sense of humor is sharp, ready, and appropriate * Thompson&#39;s legal training and experience shines when it comes to framing the issue, such as &amp;quot;why not Barack Obama?</description>

      <description>I have been railing against idiots who think human activity causes global warming for years. I find it interesting, then, that the more evidence we get the I&amp;rsquo;m right, the more people believe that I&amp;rsquo;m wrong.
The latest evidence comes brilliantly from Jeff Jacoby via Boston Globe. Some of the facts:
 * Temperatures have been flat since 2000, even though CO2 in the atmosphere increased 4 percent * 2007, predicted by all alarmist models to be the hottest in recent history, was not * The second half of 2007 was one of the coldest in recent times * Ice in Antarctica is growing rapidly for the first time in 6,000 years * Al Gore is an idiot  There.</description>

      <description>Robert Novak (h/t Wizbang! Jim Addison) reveals today that Mitt Romney&amp;rsquo;s campaign released the phony story that Fred Thompson would withdraw and send his support to McCain.Â That may explain why it appeared Thompson and McCain singled out Romney for attacks in Saturday Night&amp;rsquo;s debate on ABC.
Addision is a bit skeptical of Novak&amp;rsquo;s conclusions, noting that Bob did not name a source.Â I suspected Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s campaign as the source, but Romney is also a possibility.</description>

      <description>Last night I had to log off as soon asthe GOP debate ended, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d log my impressions this morning.
The Good
Thompson, McCain, and Giuliani helped themselves in varying degrees. Captain Ed Morrissey seems to agree:
 Fred Thompson got Romney to admit he liked the &amp;ldquo;mandates that you want&amp;rdquo;. It seemed to me that Thompson and McCain won the foreign policy portion of the debate. Everyone got a chance to score a few points off of Ron Paul, who trotted out the same tired &amp;ldquo;terrorism is our fault&amp;rdquo; theme that he just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to surrender.</description>

      <description>What I got out of the debate:
Ron Paul looks like Jack Riley, the comedian who played Mr. Carlin on the Bob Newhart Show in the 1970s:

That, and Fred Thompson won hands down. Rudy and McCain (in that order) Placed and Showed.
OIL
7:40 &amp;ndash; Romney, with Fred&amp;rsquo;s help, says he&amp;rsquo;s against windfall profits tax.
7:39 &amp;ndash; Giuliani is right-on on energy, particularly new refineries and nuclear power plants.</description>

      <description>Former governor Mitt Romney has won the Wyoming Caucuses. Romney has 6 of the 12 delegates up for grabs. Two other delegates are split between Thompson and Duncan Hunter. With 4 delegates to be decided, that leaves Romney with a lock.
Nonetheless, if Thompson could pick up 3 of the remaining 4, it would be a banner day for the true conservative voice.
The Wyoming GOP has an Excel spreadsheet showing the candidate favored in each county.</description>

 Incredible.
Curt links to PoliGazette, which wrote:

      <description>Fred Thompson, who only a week ago was predicted to finish behind Ron Paul, roared into third place in the Iowa Caucuses, passing McCain and Giuliani. Huckabee and Romney finished one and two.
Because so many had written off Thompson, his third-place showing should bolster his campaign&amp;ndash;a campaign that seemed stuck in low gear until recently.
The sad news is the support for Huckabee, a &amp;ldquo;non-conservative&amp;rdquo; Baptist minister who played a populism card in Iowa, demagoguing the Christian Right to build big momentum headed into the caucuses.</description>

      <description>Iran commissioned a stealth attack submarine on November 28, adding a dangerous and potentially destabilizing weapon to its aggressive arsenal. Built with Russian help, the Ghadir is capable of launching torpedoes and missiles simultaneously.
Perhaps Iran has suspended its nuke program. Perhaps not. An advanced sub patrolling the Med in the hands of Iranian nuts is bad news for that part of the world.
Makes me wish I was still in our submarine force.</description>

      <description>Just as Fred Thompson&amp;rsquo;s campaign started to take off, a loose conspiracy of MSM and bloggers seems determined to bring him down.
As I blogged last night, a single rumor on Control Congress, which seemed implausible, turned into a major story today&amp;ndash;the day of the Iowa Cauci.
Apparently, the anti-Thompson forces were spooked by his surge in the polls in Iowa and decided to employ one of the dirtiest tricks in politics:Â the withdrawal rumor.</description>

      <description>Control Congress carried a rumor, today, that appears to have no legs.
 I was watching the Morning Joe and they claim the rumor is out that if Thompson does badly in Iowa he may pull out and endorse McCain.
 Whether or not McCain or Thompson might, at campaign&amp;rsquo;s end, recommend their supporters to one or the other remains a possibility.Â But I seriously doubt this rumor came from inside Thompson&amp;rsquo;s campaign.</description>

      <description>There are reasons to believe that Fred Thompson&amp;rsquo;s campaign is surging in Iowa.
First, Zogby&amp;lsquo;s daily tracking poll finds Thompson in a tie for 3rd with McCain.
Second, a Des Moines Register poll concluded 12/30 saw Thompson&amp;rsquo;s numbers rise by 2 percentage points.
Third, strategic Vision, concluded 12/30, shows an up-tic for Thompson.
Fourth, pundits are taking notice of both the late surge and Thompson&amp;rsquo;s penchant for substance over glitz:</description>

      <description>Liberalism is cultural treason.
Past US wars have spawned heroes.Â Generations honored them.Â I came of age in the 1980s, but I was well aware of men like Audey Murphy, Ted Knight, Doolittle, Patton, the men of Iwo Jima, the Baton Death March.Â These great men shaped our understanding of what it means to be a man.
Liberalism, though, has robbed my sons of such heroes.Â At least, it&amp;rsquo;s made their task of learning about these heroes much more difficult.</description>

      <description>From CNN:
 A senior aide to Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee admitted Friday that the former Arkansas governor had &amp;ldquo;no foreign policy credentials&amp;rdquo; after his comments reacting to the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto raised questions.
 When a candidate&amp;rsquo;s senior aide admits the candidate knows nothing about the world beyond Arkansas, USA, the voters must take the aide seriously.Â A vote for Huckabee might be more un-American than a vote for a Democrat.</description>

      <description>Lawyers don&amp;rsquo;t like to ask questions of a witness unless they know the answer the witness will give and can compel the witness to give it.
Hillary Clinton, whose troubles with questions from the people are the stuff of political legend, is employing the reverse of this lawyer&amp;rsquo;s rule:Â don&amp;rsquo;t take questions if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a good answer.
As Riehl World View explains that Hillary&amp;rsquo;s take NO questions in an attempt to avoid further gaffes, like not knowing how many children her close, personal friend Benazir Bhutto had.</description>

      <description>I planned to get new brakes on my car and to rearrange the storage room in the basement with my week off between Christmas and New Year&amp;rsquo;s. Solitary tasks.
Yesterday, though, like many of you, I read about theBlog Burst for Fred Thompson. I linked to Captain&amp;rsquo;s Quarter&amp;rsquo;s (where I first read the story), then to Rick Moran and John Hawkins, who seem to have launched the effort. For the rest of the day, I found myself e-mailing friends and posting updates about the effort to raise enough money for Fred to run a commercial in Iowa lead up to the caucuses.</description>

      <description>The two leading Democrat contenders for president took time out from their campaigns, yesterday, using Benazir Bhutto&amp;rsquo;s assassination to demonstrate their utter incapability and unpreparedness to lead the world&amp;rsquo;s last remaining superpower.
Obama
Barrack Obama&amp;rsquo;s team blamed the United States, George Bush, and everyone who supported the Iraq War for Bhutto&amp;rsquo;s assassination. In other words, like the child he is, Obama blamed everyone but himself.
Clinton
  Our friend Gateway Pundit points out that Hillary&amp;rsquo;s soliloquy on Bhutto centered on the Senators long, close, personal relationship with Bhutto that lasted a dozen years.</description>

The blog burst has put Fred back on the air in Iowa. From our friend, Sean Hackbarth, at Fred &amp;lsquo;08:
  Your efforts are working. âSubstanceâ is now airing in Iowa. Weâre only $87,398 away from making sure it stays running through the caucuses. If 2200 people give $40 we make our goal. Thatâs doable since our average contribution today has been over $70.This wide-open Republican race means anything can happen.</description>

      <description>Mark Steyn might have said it best
Benazir Bhutto&amp;rsquo;s return to Pakistan had a mad recklessness about it which give today&amp;rsquo;s events a horrible   inevitability.
Were any of us surprised to hear the news today? An Islamofascist slug shot to death Benazir Bhutto then blew up, either of his own volition or remotely by his sponsors. (We&amp;rsquo;ve learned to not believe that all terrorism executors are volunteers.)
Pakistan is home to Usama bin Laden, al Qaeda&amp;rsquo;s central command, and the what remains of the Taliban.</description>

YOU DID IT!Â THE BLOG BURST REACHED ITS GOAL
Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s too strong, but it&amp;rsquo;s true. Anyone who votes for a candidate because of his or her statements on current issues is a moron too intellectually lazy to consider the gravity of a vote for president. Moreover, &amp;ldquo;issues voters&amp;rdquo; are gullible and selfish egomaniacs too caught up in their own immediate wants to recognize a liar when he&amp;rsquo;s selling them snake oil.</description>

Citing four hit pieces in major papers, including The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post (here and here), USA Today, and The Hill, the DrudgeReport does to Pelosi and Reid what no amount of Republican advertising could ever do;Â he proves that Democrats are unfit to run the government.

      <description>Has everyone missed the real story behind the National Intelligence Assessment of Iranian nukes?
Conservatives, like Rush Limbaugh and Michelle Malkin, are doing back-bends to convince us that Iran is still a nuclear threat. Fine. I won&amp;rsquo;t argue that point. But a much larger story here looms, and everyone is missing it.
Iran&amp;rsquo;s reported abandonment of it nuclear weapons drive coincides with the United States&amp;rsquo; invasion of Iraq!

      <description>National Review expresses surprise and thanks that one Republican candidate has actually released comprehensive policy plans to deal with today&amp;rsquo;s challenges. Even more amazing to NR is the content of those plans: Conservative.
That candidate is Fred Thompson, who leads the GOP in publishing specific ideas. Perhaps the reason other candidates don&amp;rsquo;t put their ideas onto paper is that they don&amp;rsquo;t have any. Or they know that conservatives won&amp;rsquo;t like them.</description>

Also, Hall of Record offers some intriguing charts comparing the oil price trends to recent crashes in tech stocks and the 1981-1986 world oil price collapse. As I said, &amp;ldquo;intriguing.&amp;rdquo;
And this from the Wall Street Journal:
 Early signs of an easing in global demand growth and swings by Wall Street traders are pushing oil away from the historic $100-a-barrel mark, at least for now.</description>

      <description>The next election loomed ominously upon the political horizon in November 1979. A decade of failed foreign policy, Soviet expansion, stagflation, gas and oil shortages, historically severe winters, soaring crime rates, marauding youth, sexual perversion, and unstable standards left the American people wondering, &amp;ldquo;What next?&amp;rdquo;
Next, of course, was the Iranian hostage crisis, which might well be called &amp;ldquo;the last straw.&amp;rdquo; Jimmy Carter and his Democrat party took the blame. The once proud term &amp;ldquo;liberalism&amp;rdquo; became profane.</description>

Unlike many others&amp;ndash;from WWII to Iraq and Afghanistan&amp;ndash;I am physically unscathed and mentally better off than I was in November 1984. That&amp;rsquo;s when I left St. Louis MEPS for Navy Recruit Training Center, Orlando. Military life is military, but the submarine force ain&amp;rsquo;t bad duty, if you can get it. I got it.

      <description>Does your college freshman attend mandatory thought indoctrination camps?Â Is he formally and publicly humiliated by the university if his view on gay marriage, global warming, or affirmative action differ from Barrack Obama&amp;rsquo;s?Â Doe his college or university punish him for holding opinions that are inconsistent with the Democrat Underground and other anti-American hate groups?
If he attends University of Delaware, the answer is &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo;
Thanks to Joanne Jacobs on Pajama&amp;rsquo;s Media (h/t The Discerning Texan), we learn that Delaware is holding liberal, Soviet-style thought control experiments on its students, for which its faculty and administration should be taken out and shot.</description>

Banks are run by stupid, short-sighted people. They brought the current mortgage crisis, quickly turning into a general credit problem, upon themselves. They will wise up just in time to make us pay for their mistakes, but you already knew that.

 In a speech Friday at the Center for National Policy, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said, &amp;ldquo;President Bush is preparing to tell the nation, once again, that his strategy in Iraq is succeeding. We know what the Bush-Petraeus report will say: The surge is working. Be patient.</description>

      <description>Tell everyone Hennessy broke the story. America won the Iraq war.Â The insurgency is broken! Peace prevails. The terrorists are routed!Where are the headlines? A man between the ages of 18 and 30 has a better chance of being murdered inÂ Philadelphiathan of dying in Iraq in September. The third head of al Qaeda in Iraq is dead&amp;ndash;three in 18 months. Ascending to that throne is no promotion.Â Face it, folks, we won the war.</description>

      <description>Northern Pakistan&amp;ndash;al Qaeda Entertainment, a division of al Qaeda-at-large, announced today that the next Osama bin Laden video will feature American pop star Britney Spears.
al Qaeda hopes that Spears&amp;rsquo; presence will help increase viewership in the 15-24 demographic, a prime target for terrorist recruitment.Â Melinda Roikers, Ms. Spears&amp;rsquo; publicist, said the OBL video could mitigate some of the damage to Britney&amp;rsquo;s career and reputation as a result of her public drunkeness, her radical haircut, her feud with her mother, andÂ herÂ recent appearance on the Video Music Awards.</description>

      <description>Washington &amp;ndash; Massechusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, today, challenged General David Petraeus, commander of forces in Iraq, to a fist fight in the rotunda of the Capitol over their disagreements on the effectiveness of surge.
&amp;ldquo;If General &amp;lsquo;Betray Us&amp;rsquo; were half the man he acts like in front of the cameras, he&amp;rsquo;d come out here and fight like one,&amp;rdquo; shouted an angry and apparently intoxicated Kennedy during an impromptu press conference near the Declaration of Independence display.</description>

      <description>It breaks my heart to write these words.
I spent 11 years in the U.S. Navy. I thought the long hours, the humiliation, the lousy pay, and missing the 1980s was worth it. I thought my country appreciated our work.
Apparently, I was wrong:
 Zogby Poll: 51% of Americans Want Congress to Probe Bush/Cheney Regarding 9/11 Attacks; Over 30% Seek Immediate Impeachment
 If I believedÂ this pollÂ be accurate, I really wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to be an American any longer.</description>

Among high school students, Obama trounced second-place candidate Hillary Clinton 62 percent to 14 percent. The mentally ill, including schizophrenics and victims of head trauma, gave Barack a slight advantage over Democrat Dennis Kucinich 34 to 32 with Joe Biden of Maryland finishing a close third.</description>

      <description>Even though he spoke the words much earlier during the Tonight Show&amp;rsquo;s taping, just moments ago, Americans heard it for the first time.Â &amp;ldquo;I am running for President of the United States,&amp;rdquo; Fred told Jay Leno.Â If the audience in NBC&amp;rsquo;s Burbank studios represented a cross-section of the US, then Fred&amp;rsquo;s announcement is a welcome one.Â The audience went wild.
I got the feeling Fred was a little tight just around the time he said he&amp;rsquo;s running.</description>

      <description>. . . you have to do it yourself.
That&amp;rsquo;s the MSM&amp;rsquo;s motto over the upcoming Patraeus report to Congress on progress in Iraq.
The facts are obvious:Â since the surge and offensive began, the terrorists in Iraq have become less effective.Â The surge and the offensive are working.Â Those who agree with this view inlude these liberals and Democrats:

      <description>In a story out of Geneva, today, the United Nations reports that US workers are the most productive in the world, both hourly and annually. That&amp;rsquo;s no surprise, except to Democrats who like to paint Americans as the scum of the earth.
The hours that we work are a bit off-putting, though.
 The U.S. employee put in an average 1,804 hours of work in 2006, the report said. That compared with 1,407.</description>

      <description>As I predicted last week, the Democrats have hired the Associated Press to make up stories that discredit the success of the surge.
Last week, as good new about the surge was cresting, the AP treated as fact an opinion piece that the &amp;ldquo;body count&amp;rdquo; in Iraq had doubled since the surge began.
Today, AP customers are leading with another AP opinion piece claiming that August was one of the bloodiest months since the Iraq war began.</description>

      <description>Since July, I have been saying that the surge is working because America is on offense instead of hunkering down on defense.Â Captain&amp;rsquo;s Quarters found a Petraeus interview in whichÂ the HMFIC in Iraq confirms that it&amp;rsquo;s not just the numbers, it&amp;rsquo;s the attitude:
 How have things changed in Iraq? Petraeus compared the previous condition of Ramadi to Stalingrad. The general told the newspaper that having to stay on defense had taken its toll on American strength and had emboldened the enemy.</description>

Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging for Fred since there were only about a dozen and a half bloggers for Fred. All I&amp;rsquo;m saying is that, when he&amp;rsquo;s trying to fill his Cabinet . . .

 Of 528 total papers on climate change, only 38 (7%) gave an explicit endorsement of the consensus. If one considers &amp;ldquo;implicit&amp;rdquo; endorsement (accepting the consensus without explicit statement), the figure rises to 45%.</description>

      <description>Just a few days, other bloggers (Captain Ed)Â and I speculated on the ramifications on Democrat surrender strategies of the increasingly obvious improvements in Iraq since the surge began.Â Ever the WaPo worried about how the Dems would deal.
Now we know: propaganda.
Following the phony story that Gen. Pace would urge the President to cut troops in Iraq by half, the Red Crescent, today, released a report that a record number of Iraqis have fled their homes in fear of their lives since the surge began.</description>

But the story was a fabrication, likely designed to quell the growing support for the war.</description>

      <description>It started in July with polls showing Americans were increasingly supportive of the war in Iraq. Then, the President&amp;rsquo;s approval rating began to climb. Then Congress&amp;rsquo;s approval rating fell to an all-time low. In between, the odd Democrat Congressman or analyst returned from Iraq saying good things, not bad, about the effect of the troop surge.
With thanks to the California Conservative and Captain Ed for finding this story, we find that the Washington Post is reporting that the Democrats are forced to shift their policy on Iraq because of the undeniable success of the surge.</description>

Environmentalist Bette Midler (who, I think, is related to Barbara Streisand) faces state charges in Hawaii for illegally killing more than 200 trees on her estate.Â  The staff of the Board of Land and Natural Resources recommended $6,500 in fines for having the trees felled and for building a graded road without permits required for the land zoned for conservation use.
 Of course, she had the trees clear-cut in order to improve the environment, or so her publicist claims.</description>

The lefty claims that Thompson is violating the law by operating like a candidate without declaring his candidacy.Â Hudson plans to file similar complaints against George Washington, who spent much of the Revolutionary War traveling through critical electoral states, like Pennsylvannia and New York, without declaring himself a candidate for President.</description>

      <description>I stand for total victory in Iraq.
Background Some say that I blindly support President Bush and everything he does. I do not. Nor do I publicly lambaste his missteps the way others, like Peggy Noonan, do. This blog, I hope, will explain to my readers and friends how I can hold several seemingly incongruous positions on Bush and the War.
 * The United States, the free world, in fact, was justified in invading Iraq and overthrowing Saddam * The war in Iraq was not successful in its early days despite the perception of a rout * The administration&#39;s greatest failure was kowtowing to the left * The symptom of that kowtowing was establishing a defensive posture instead of continuing the attack * Donald Rumsfeld failed the President by refusing to return to an offensive strategy * The key to victory is ruthless aggression * Republicans should limit criticism of Bush to recommendations that will achieve victory  Justification Following 9/11, President Bush told Peggy Noonan in a private meeting that every night he goes to bed expecting to be woken and told that Saddam has unleashed a WMD in America.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re still 15 months away from the next general election.Â Remember that.Â Getting groceries and taking the kids to hockey practice are more important.Â Two World Series separate us from the election, not to mention a season and a half of football, more than a year ofÂ school.Â A child born today will be talking and walking before the election.
That said, Fred Thompson spoke to CNN yesterday, and his remarks make interesting reading.</description>

      <description>Apparently, an Iranian army special forces unit is in Iraq training Shiite militias on the more effective methods of killing Americans. You&amp;rsquo;ll be pleased to know that the US is &amp;ldquo;tracking&amp;rdquo; them.
My question is, Why aren&amp;rsquo;t we killing them? The Kurds are, according this story at Gateway Pundit.
They are enemy combatants in an American occupation zone. We need answer to no one for eliminating this problem.
This points to my whole problem with the way the Bush administration has handled Iraq.</description>

      <description>Catholic Bishop Tiny Muskens (make your own joke) says all Christians should refer to God only as &amp;ldquo;Allah.&amp;rdquo; The Dutch bishop believes that surrendering to the Muslims is in the best interest of Christianity.
Thanks, but no thanks, Your Excellency. Instead of that, how about if we call you &amp;ldquo;de-frocked&amp;rdquo; Bishop?
According to CWN:
 The Dutch bishop admitted that his suggestion was not likely to gain widespread acceptance. But he predicted that within a century or two, Dutch Catholics would be addressing prayers to &amp;ldquo;Allah.</description>

      <description>I just blogged about the bad, sad events in St. Louis, Missouri, today. A 22-year-old police officer shot to death on duty; a famous, majestic church burned.
But looking around the internet, I find bad news all over. It was one of those days when the world&amp;rsquo;s rhythms crossed into bad vibes.
Some of those vibrations shook the earth in Peru, to the tune of 8.0 on the Richter scale, killing at least 850, probably more.</description>

      <description>This morning, I heard the news of the murder of a young police officer.
  Officer Norvelle Brown, only 22 years old and a rookie cop, made St. Louis headlines for the second time in his short career&amp;ndash;his short, honorable life.Â In April, Officer Brown responded to a hostage situation during a barber shop robber, defusing the situation and apprehending the armed robbers. He and another officer received citations for that action.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know why this story depresses me so much, but it does.Â It makes me sad for a lot of people.
FoxNews.com relays a Times of London story of a company that offers to financially, socially, and otherwise ruin people&amp;rsquo;s lives for a meager $20 USD. I won&amp;rsquo;t provide a link to the dreadful site.
 A service offering a complete &amp;ldquo;revenge package&amp;rdquo; in which people can destroy the financial status and relationships of their enemies at the click of a mouse is being offered over the Internet.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the editorials on the editorial pages, but the remarkably blatant editorializing in the &amp;ldquo;news&amp;rdquo; stories covering Karl Rove&amp;rsquo;s resignation from the White House.
An AP story by Terence Hunt retrieved from news.myway.com begins by describing the whole of the Bush administration as &amp;ldquo;turbulent.&amp;rdquo; Perhaps, but the color of the paragraph indicates that the turbulence was Rove&amp;rsquo;s fault. If blaming Rove was Hunt&amp;rsquo;s intention, then Hunt must believe Rove ordered the Islamofascist hijackers to fly airplanes into buildings.</description>

      <description>A new CBS News poll of 302 Republicans shows that Rudy Giuliani has widened his lead over Fred Thompson. Captain&amp;rsquo;s Quarters breaks down the unreliability of CBS, the problems with the sample, etc, so I won&amp;rsquo;t repeat that here.
Instead, let&amp;rsquo;s say the numbers are correct and Fred Thompson is fading fast. Two questions come up: Why? and What of it?
Why: Interest in Thompson as the non-candidate peaked in late June and the first week of July.</description>

Mel at aniMel describes two of the crimes, ending with a wonderful summary of the problem of illegal immigration:
 I want to be free. I want my country to be safe. I want to stop reading these sad stories of tragedy that the alien invaders hand us every day while they laugh and say, &amp;ldquo;now give me my civil rights or I&amp;rsquo;ll sue you!</description>

      <description>The incestuous relationship between the Democrat party and the MSM may be the Dem&amp;rsquo;s weakest link.
Big media are good two things: creating celebrities and destroying them. Think of Cindy Sheehan, Michael Jackson, Howard Dean. The evening news, the New York Times and Washington Post, the entertainment columns and television shows all contributed mightily to the rise and fall of these celebrities.
When Barack Obama threw into the presidential race, the media provided millions of dollars in free advertising.</description>

      <description>A NASA Goddard scientist says that the massive thunderstorm&amp;ndash;complete with tornado&amp;ndash;that struck New York City on Wednesday was not the result of global warming.
In a FoxNews.com article, James Hansen explains that the storm cannot be blamed on climate change, but it can be attributed to human activity.
Cities, it seems, make storms worse. Tall buildings direct wind upward, intensifying the storms. City heat islands, like warm ocean water to a hurricane, fuel storms.</description>

      <description>Too much of a good thing, as my mother would say, turns bad.
When Chesterton wrote &amp;ldquo;Orthodoxy&amp;rdquo; in 1908, he looked at his modern times and pitied their unimaginative banality. He would surely weep aloud were he to observe our times.
&amp;ldquo;The modern world,&amp;rdquo; he wrote a century ago, &amp;ldquo;is full of the old Christian virtues gone mad. The virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone.</description>

      <description>The only lasting impact of the Iowa straw poll will be the removal of Sam Brownback.
Brownback bussed in supporters by the bushel at $35 a head. He bet the farm on Iowa, and he lost. Mike Huckabee scored more votes than he paid for, which, as Time magazine points out, means one of two things: some of Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s supporters paid their own fare, or Huckabee stole votes from people who entered the fair on another candidate&amp;rsquo;s dime.</description>

      <description>The White House announced yesterday that the 2008 budget deficit would be smaller than originally projected, as will the 2007 deficit. The reasons: 1) the economy is strong and 2) tax cuts stimulate taxable economic activity.
We&amp;rsquo;ve know that that tax cuts increase federal revenue (to a point) since John F. Kennedy explained it in 1961. The Laffer Curve was the final word on the subject and should have earned Arthur Laffer the Nobel Prize for economics.</description>

(I have no doubt that Murtha drank of Ho Chi Minh&amp;rsquo;s kool-aid in Viet Nam.) Murtha&amp;rsquo;s lies, smears, libels, and slanders launched an anti-American industry that just held its Yearly Kos nightmare in Chicago.
The Marines libeled by Murtha and others are free, now.</description>

      <description>The left&amp;rsquo;s foreign policy is both domestic and global.
John Hawkins, in Right Wing News&amp;rsquo;s Q&amp;amp;A, responds to a question posed by RtWingNutCase, to wit: should the US pull out of Iraq prematurely, would the left turn its activism toward influencing a withdrawal from Afghanistan?
Hawkins correctly says, &amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; but he stops short of speculating on motives. I won&amp;rsquo;t.
The left&amp;rsquo;s motive in withdrawing from the world is to weaken America and the West.</description>

Michelle Malkin does an outstanding job of breaking down the NASA Y2K error that sort of invented global warming.
In short, 1998 was NOT the hottest year of the 20th century. And half of the hottest years on record occured before WWII. Al Gore is an idiot, and now NASA scientists have proven it.
Earlier this week, the wackos got bad news from U of C San Diego and NASA who discovered that aerosols do not mask atmospheric warming but accelerate it.</description>

      <description>The Charleston terrorist story that began last Saturday has not been resolved, but the networks, dailies, and news magazines are keeping it hush-hush. Why? Are they cooperating with the feds in a larger investigation? Or did the DNC or one of the Democrat campaigns ask the media to bury the story? Or do the MSM no longer consider terrorism in the United States newsworthy?
Captain Ed asks some of the same, disturbing questions, and links to other who ask them, as well.</description>

Tonight I decided to try Apple&amp;rsquo;s Safari for Windows. It&amp;rsquo;s a beta version, but it&amp;rsquo;s about the 3rd beta.
I have to admit, it&amp;rsquo;s impressive.
The Clear Text is a little easier to read than IE7 and miles more readable than FireFox. Performance is excellent. The look, though, is fantastic. Nothing on the screeen that you don&amp;rsquo;t need&amp;ndash;unless you want it.</description>

      <description>Sean Hackbarth, the guy who runs The American Mind blog, has jumped onboard the Fred Thompson victory train as a member of the web team.
Congratulations to Sean and to Fred. Both will benefit greatly from the effort, I am sure.
If you&amp;rsquo;re not with Fred yet, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not too late.</description>

      <description>The second poll in a week&amp;ndash;this one by USAToday/Gallup&amp;ndash;shows that support for the war in Iraq is growing. The latest poll shows that public perception of America&amp;rsquo;s success has increased substantially in the past month. The numbers coincide with the increasing effectiveness of the surge.
 In the latest USA TODAY/Gallup Poll, taken Friday through Sunday, the proportion of those who said the additional troops are &amp;ldquo;making the situation better&amp;rdquo; rose to 31% from 22% a month ago.</description>

      <description>From the AP:
 Microorganisms locked in Antarctic ice for 100,000 years and more came to life and resumed growing when given warmth and nutrients in a laboratory.
 Okay, so science has reconstituted microorganisms that haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the light of day since the dinosaurs scoured the earth. And this is good news?
Here&amp;rsquo;s what the left will do with this information:
 * These microorganisms prove that human activity causes global warming, according to Al Gore.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: 6:42 p.m. CDT: MSNBC.com now reporting that the two Muslim men arrested near the Charleston Naval Weapons Station were in possession of pipe bombs. Their attorney assures us that a) they have a really good reason for possessing pipe bombs, and b) the two Middle Eastern men with pipe bombs near a Navy base are victims of racial profiling. Whatever. Profile away.
   Before details about the pipe bombs were released, the executive director of a civil rights organization for Muslims in Tampa criticized the arrest as racial profiling, an accusation South Carolina police denied.</description>

      <description>For years, global warming alarmists have claimed that aerosols have masked the effects of greenhouse gases in the past, explaining why global temperatures cooled during a period of rapid greenhouse gas production in the 20th century.
But a new study by University of California-San Diego and NASA (found on FoxNews.com) indicates that the alarmists were wrong about the aerosols: they don&amp;rsquo;t reduce temperature but raise it. In other words, the things that wackos claim to reduce global warming actually cause global warming.</description>

      <description>UPDATEÂ Michelle Malkin reports that the two suspects arrestedÂ with explosives near Charleston, SC, last night are Muslims.Â See MichelleMalkin.com for updated details. (Maybe they were on their way home from YearlyKos.)Â From the Charleston ABC News affiliate&amp;rsquo;s website:
 The Berkeley County Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s Office believes thatÂ among materials in the car&amp;rsquo;s trunk were a bomb and bomb making materials that include chemicals, fuses, and igniters.Â The men 21-year-old Yousef Megahed and 24-year-old Ahmed MohamedÂ were pulled over Saturday evening during a routine trafficÂ stop near Myers Road and Highway 176.</description>

      <description>The YearlyKos could be the last hurrah of this new hard left, the way Woodstock was the final note of the song of the Sixties.
YearlyKos is a get-together of hard left bloggers organized by DailyKos founder Markos Moulitsas. DailyKos claimed, perhaps rightly, responsibility for the Democrat Congressional victory in 2006&amp;ndash;much the way Hammas might claim victory for blowing up an Israeli schoolhouse.
The Kos and Democratic Underground people who filled attendee list are the kind of folks who giggle at Dick Cheney&amp;rsquo;s heart problems, wish al Qaeda victory in its war against the West, and popped bottles of bubbly upon hearing of Chief Justice Roberts&amp;rsquo; seizure.</description>

      <description>We nominated Bob Dole, didn&amp;rsquo;t we?
Anyway, TexasFred&amp;lsquo;s has been listening in on the Romney campaign and heard this:
 Mitt Romney has cited the social welfare network of the Lebanese Hezbollah terror group as a role model the U.S. should copy to help promote âgoodnessâ and âfreedomâ around the world.
 I know . . . out of context, read the whole thing, and all that.Â Still, a guy running for president ought to know that praising Hezbollah is a good way to become a really, really difficult trivia question about people who ran for president in 2008.</description>

      <description>Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) generates more internet press than all the other candidates combined, it seems. His name has been on Technorati&amp;rsquo;s most-searched list for a couple weeks, rivaling Paris Hilton and YouTube for search popularity endurance. Whether or not his fledgling campaign for President will so endure is another matter.
Rummaging through the odd blog with a Ron Paul theme, I found some common characteristics among his supporters:
 * Young * Typically apolitical * Technology careers * Homosexual * Educated * Atheist * Decent writing skills * No particular axe to grind  I know many who fit the type, particularly working in the software industry.</description>

      <description>Last night in the U.S. House of Representatives, a party&amp;rsquo;s leadership refused to abide by a legal vote (Volunteer Opinion Journal).
The vote was on a Republican measure to strip from a farm bill language that guaranteed welfare for illegal aliens. The vote was 215-213 in favor of stripping the guarantees.
But Nancy Pelosi wanted a different result. So, her minions essentially burned the ballots, declared there was no vote, and ordered a new one (Michelle Malkin).</description>

      <description>Democrat candidate for president Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s bizarre chess game with foreign policy took another twist today.
In remarks to a report, Obama seemed to formulate his nuclear policy as he went along:
 &amp;ldquo;I think it would be a profound mistake for us to use nuclear weapons in any circumstance,&amp;rdquo; Obama said, with a pause, &amp;ldquo;involving civilians.&amp;rdquo; Then he quickly added, &amp;ldquo;Let me scratch that. There&amp;rsquo;s been no discussion of nuclear weapons.</description>

      <description>Barack Obama proves he would be a dangerous commander-in-chief.
Two weeks ago, he told us that the United States is obliged to stay out of wars, even to prevent genocide. He would not have fought Germany in World War II unless Germany attacked the United States. He would not stop the genocide in Darfur or Congo. He would not have gone to Somalia or Bosnia.
That, again, was two weeks ago.</description>

      <description>The UN Security Council, today, finally got around to approving a 26,000-strong force to control the violence in Darfur (FoxNews.com).
I have a depressing suspicion that this means there are no Christians left for the Muslims to kill in Darfur. Expat Yank thinks the same:
 There are only two reasons a predator state engaged in fomenting widespread slaughter (the UN has not termed Darfur âgenocideâ) will voluntarily allow in a UN peacekeeping force: 1) that state has already accomplished most of its âslaughterâ goals (remember, this conflict began in February 2003), or 2) it doesnât believe the UN force will be able to accomplish much of anything anyway, so its best to let it be deployed in order to get the âinternational communityâ off its back.</description>

Schumer&amp;rsquo;s justification for effectively abolishing the Supreme Court is the so anti-historical and anti-Constitutional it&amp;rsquo;s almost funny.</description>

   The Prime Minister vowed to take Winston Churchillâs lead and make Britainâs ties with America even stronger.
  Mr Brown stunned critics by THANKING President Bush for the fight against Islamic extremism, and insisted the UK-US relationship will be his No1 foreign policy priority.</description>

Ed Morrissey had been keeping up with these events, and this story today on Captain&amp;rsquo;s Quarters may signal the end to Musharraf&amp;rsquo;s patience with the radicals.</description>

In a country like the United States where federalism has been replaced by Big Government, you probably need to get hold of your U. S. Congressman. If he&amp;rsquo;s so inclined, he&amp;rsquo;ll attach an amendment that authorizes the placement of the stop sign to some bill.</description>

Those of us whose conservative conversions occured in the late 1970s and early 1980s, I think, are particularly fascinated by the 10th Amendment to the Constitution. We also mourn over its senseless destruction by Congress, courts, and citizens.
 The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved for the States respectively, or to the people.</description>

      <description>Five kids is a lot these days.Â &amp;ldquo;You have five kids?Â Oh, my God!&amp;rdquo; people say, their eyes bugged out, mouths wide open.
Even when the oldest were babies, developmental psychologists were advising parent not to tell children &amp;ldquo;no.&amp;rdquo;Â Their theory was that &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; would teach a child limitation and destroy his curiosity.Â Instead, offer an alternative.Â Well, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.Â But the funny thing is, it&amp;rsquo;s the no &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; advice is totally out of synch with society.</description>

      <description>Matt Margolis at GOP Bloggers questions the cutting-edginess of the YouTube debate. He&amp;rsquo;s right in his various points about the ordinariness of the whole affair.
To make the presidential race more interesting, I propose a blog-off. The candidates have to start a blog using a commonly available blog app: WordPress (my fave), MoveableType, etc. The candidate with the highest TLB Ecosystem score wins his party&amp;rsquo;s nomination.
The rules
 1. Posts must be submitted by the candidate himself or herself.</description>

      <description>Michelle Malkin responds to that unnecessary race of humans known as liberals. The liberals, it seems, have gone about calling her web site, michellemalkin.com, a &amp;ldquo;hate-site.&amp;rdquo;
Other bloggers are jumping in to defend Michelle. I won&amp;rsquo;t. I think she has one of the best blogs in the business, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t need my defense.
First, liberals are evil little creatures&amp;ndash;more little than evil, in the small, petty sense. Their self-righteous slander is not really meant to hurt its target as to aggrandize the speaker or writer in his own small mind and among his own petty peers.</description>

      <description>Boston.com reports that social conservatives are &amp;ldquo;coalescing&amp;rdquo; around Fred Thompson as their choice for Republican nominee for President in 2008.
 &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a consensus developing around him that&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear and pretty profound,&amp;rdquo; said John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, an Orlando-based conservative group. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anything like it in 25 years in politics.&amp;rdquo;
 I agree. In 1979, as a high school sophomore with a National Review subscription, I became dissatisfied (for a short time) with the GOP.</description>

      <description>St. Louis, MO &amp;ndash; The Washington Post is reporting that former U. S. Senator and presumed Republican candidate (nominee?) for President, Fred Thompson, may have practiced law during a period of his life when he was out of office, according to sources inside BlogsForFredThompson.com.
The speculation is based on discoveries of Fred Thompson&amp;rsquo;s signature and name on court briefs in various Washington, DC. One of the briefs&amp;ndash;a &amp;ldquo;friend of the court&amp;rdquo; brief&amp;ndash; from August 1981 argues that citizens cannot be arrested for activities that are not against the law.</description>

      <description>Al Gore said this would be the worst year for hurricanes since hurricaning began, in 1952.
Matt Margolis, who does great research, has the answer.
 The 2007 hurricane season may be less severe than forecast due to cooler-than-expected water temperatures in the tropical Atlantic, private forecaster WSI Corp said on Tuesday.
 Just not enough global warming.Â The Gores&amp;rsquo;ll have to kick out a lot more CO2 in 2008.Â See Matt&amp;rsquo;s piece for the whole story.</description>

Huh.
Didn&amp;rsquo;t Jimmy Carter promise something like that in 1976? Except then it was China, the Soviet Union, East Germany, and the Grand Dutchy of Fenwick.
This gaff (is that how to spell &amp;ldquo;gaff?&amp;quot;) came during the YouTube debate, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch. I actually have avoided everything about it, but I stumbled onto Hugh Hewitt and had to giggle.</description>

Poll: American Support for War Inches Up The story cites an NYT/CBS Poll that showed America support for war in Iraq rose to 41% in July from 35% in May. You will not see this story on the CBS Evening News or on the front page of America&amp;rsquo;s most un-American paper, though. The results do not fit either organization&amp;rsquo;s political agenda.</description>

 Despite their general inability to prevail in Iraq, successfully detonate explosives in Britain, and do anything else in the US, AQ warned Muslims to stay away from their own government buildings on the south side of the Mediterranean
 He writes a good piece&amp;ndash;which reminded me of this humor entry I posted in 2003 and agian in 2005:</description>

  As an act of courtesy to the politics-weary American public, Fred Thompson is likely to announce his candidacy for the GOP nomination for President in September, according to columnist-reporterRobert Novak.
Thompson&amp;rsquo;s late entry may reverse a trend in recent years in which the next presidential campaign begins before the last one ends. If Thompson believes the people will be sick of Giuliani, Clinton, and Obama by the time the Super Bowl comes around, he may be right.</description>

Democrats in the House and Senate voted to encourage criminal prosecution of Americans who report suspicious activity (Gateway Pundit). Do you know how difficult it is to formulate a more dramatic representation of that fact than the fact itself (Discerning Texan)?
I hate Democrats. Yeah, I know, you&amp;rsquo;re not supposed to &amp;ldquo;hate&amp;rdquo; anyone. But Democrats are anti-American ass hats. They breed socialism.</description>

      <description>Senator Clinton asked the Pentagon to describe its plans to withdraw from Iraq. The Pentagonâspecifically, undersecretary of defense, Eric Edelmanâreplied in the most appropriate manner imaginable:
 Premature and public discussion of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq reinforces enemy propaganda that the United States will abandon its allies in Iraq, much as we are perceived to have done in Vietnam, Lebanon and Somalia
 In response, Ms. Clinton displayed the kind of hysterium one associates with under-medicated paranoid schizophrenics.</description>

      <description>Peggy Noonan is a great ally and a doubtful foe. She turned, mildly, on Reagan. She has turned on Bush. So what. Her human insights are wonderful, her writing , usually, excellent. She is setting up her pick for 2008 awkwardly.
Bush supporters and detractors, alike, have made much of Ms. Noonan&amp;rsquo;s Friday Opinion Journal column about President Bush. As a fan Peggy&amp;rsquo;s, I was disappointed. One of the hallmarks of conservatismâsomething that should distinguish us from themâis that we don&amp;rsquo;t eat our own in public.</description>

      <description>The right casual jacket sets a mood, an image, and an expectation that can make an entire year somehow better.
It&amp;rsquo;s about this time of year when I get weary of summer. I start looking ahead to cooler days of the fall, the start of football training camp and regular season. Hockey in the future.
When I was a kid, I associated this time of year with getting a new fall jacket.</description>

      <description>Maybe. Maybe not.
But the new al-Qaeda video featuring a haggard Osama bin Laden has folks speculating about his health and even his life.
Gateway Pundit compares the most recent video (in which bin Laden appears for less than a minute) with a video from 2002. The background and bin Laden&amp;rsquo;s attire are identical. And doesn&amp;rsquo;t look so hot.
If this is not a new taping, then it could be an attempt by al-Qaeda to hide the terrorist&amp;rsquo;s death.</description>

      <description>A Rasmussen poll released on Friday shows Fred Thompson, not yet declared candidate, in a virtual tie with Rudy Guiliani as McCain continues his free-fall. I know a lot of his supporters want Fred to declare soon, but I think his strategy is working. As the left and the right throw all the negatives they can find his way, his poll numbers continue to climb. Perhaps he&amp;rsquo;s letting his opponents punch themselves out .</description>

      <description>For the past 4 years, Russian dictator Putin has moved his country closer and closer to its pre-Yeltsin isolation. Today, he announced suspension of NATO inspections of nuclear missile sites.
 Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree freezing participation in the treaty that cited &amp;ldquo;extraordinary circumstances &amp;hellip; that affect the security of the Russian Federation and require immediate measures,&amp;rdquo; the Kremlin said in a statement.
 Meanwhile, Russia continues a military build-up which most Americans have ignored.</description>

The load process replaced a lot of single and double quotes with some annoying ASCII character, but I&amp;rsquo;m not in the mood to clean it up right now, if you want to know the truth.

      <description>This won&amp;rsquo;t take long, but go get a beer. I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.
Okay, here&amp;rsquo;s why Thompson will probably be the next POTUS. Personality.
We like to think we vote for intellectual reason, but we don&amp;rsquo;t. Ask any sales professional how people buy, and the answer will be, &amp;ldquo;people buy on emotion and justify on reason.&amp;rdquo; Voting is the same.
Heard of buyer&amp;rsquo;s remorse? It happens when the (emotional) rush of buying fades and you&amp;rsquo;re left with only your intellect to defend the purchase.</description>

      <description>The Democrat Party released its official agendum for the 2008 party convention today. Mark Noonan, journalist extraordinaire, obtained an advance copy.
From the opening flag-burning to the end-of-evening driving arrangements, the party of defeat has thought of everything.
Mark has formatted the schedule for convenient printing and laminating. Be sure to share it with your friends.

      <description>I will be uploading my archives&amp;ndash;going back to 1999&amp;ndash;over the weekend. If you think this is a new blog, you&amp;rsquo;re mistaken. It&amp;rsquo;s been around since before the term &amp;ldquo;web log&amp;rdquo; was coined. But I moved my hosting earlier in the year, and loading posts dating back to the Clinton administration ain&amp;rsquo;t no easy task for a man my age.
Thanks for reading, and Dominus vobiscum</description>

With a quote that perfectly demonstrates the liberal idea of freedom (thanks to Michelle Malkin) Cindy &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s about me&amp;rdquo; Sheehan has declared she intends to take Nancy Pelosi&amp;rsquo;s seat in Congress in 2008.
 I have a dream of the detention centers that George has builtâ¦filled with Orange Clad neo-cons and neo-connettes

      <description>Congressional Democrats are finding leadership isn&amp;rsquo;t as fun as they thought it would be. With pressure for radical action mounting on the left, this fall could get ugly for Pelosi and Reid.
The Democrats of 2006 ran against Bush in contrast to the Republics of 1994 who ran on the Pledge with America. The result is that the current Congress sees only one duty: damage the President. That duty, unfortunately, appears nowhere in Article I of the Constitution.</description>

In 1996, I quit writing my Town Hall column because I was sick of party politics. Specifically, I was sick of the GOP running losers because it was their turn.

      <description>If you want to move your companyâand your careerâforward, concentrate on moving your product forward. Obvious, perhaps, but the concept gets little more than lip service in many organizations.
Most of my career in software development has involved web-based products that my companies sell or license to client businesses who, in turn, provide the applications for their clientsâ use. For instance, at Abiliti Solutions (now FTS), we produced telecommunications billing and analysis software, a part of which included electronic bill (or invoice) presentment and payment.</description>

      <description>After Ameren wiped out Johnson Shut-Ins State Park in southeastern Missouri, some of felt a little sorry for the company. Six months after that tragedy, a powerful thunderstorm knocked down power lines and transformers, leaving more than 100,000 Ameren customers without electricity â some for more than week. Still, Ameren had viable defenses. Among them:
Â·*Property owners blocked the company from trimming trees that threatened power lines

In the late 1990s and early 2000sâeven after 9/11âthe people I worked with were friends. We socialized after work, attended each otherâs weddings, and held heart-felt happy hours for our friends who left the company, voluntarily or not, to pursue âother opportunities,â as the official e-mail usually read.
Those were happy times. The telecommunications sector of technology where I worked at the time was shedding jobs like a German Shepherd drops hair in Spring.</description>

They donât take my story well. After all, the whole idea of many web applications is configurability. By that I mean that a non-programmer can change, add, or remove values that cause either business rules, workflows, navigation flows, or content of a web site to change.</description>

Go back to 1993, when I wrote _The Conservative Manifesto:_ï¿½ my goal was to carry on in the tradition of William F. Buckley Jr.ï¿½ After the book, I wrote for the fledgeling Town Hall Forum on CompuServe three times a week from August 1993 to about July 1995.</description>

 We are fully aware that implementing the plan will lead to some harassment for all beloved Baghdad residents, but we are confident they fully understand the brutal terrorist assault we all face,&amp;rdquo; he said.</description>

      <description>Most of my life, Democrats ran Congress . . . the way Hitler ran Germany.Ã Then in 1995, Newt Gingrich took the gavel.Ã I had to learn a whole new perspective.Ã I had to pick and choose what I was for and against, and I had to cut back on the Congress jokes.
The only good thing about the current balance of power, in my book, is that we can safely oppose everything Congress does or tries to do with absolute confidence that our position is the correct one.</description>

      <description>**UPDATE Mark Noonan posits several critical questions for Pelosi and Reid.
 Last September, a group of St. Louis Cardinals fans would call local sports talk shows and say they hoped the team wouldnât make the playoffs. They commented similar sentiments on various Cardinals forums and blogs. When the Cardinals lost a game, theyâd gloat, making fun of the âkool-aid guzzlersâ who wanted the team to make the playoffs. Claiming that losing was in the teamâs best interest, they cheered for any team the Cardinals played, including the Chicago Cubs.</description>

      <description>After the Cardinalsâ collapse at the end of the regular season, I expected my âbirds to go out in 3 or 4 to begin the long winter recovery from season of injuries and missed opportunitiesâon the field and in the front office.
Somehow, though, the team that lost something like 114 games in their last 12 rallied in the bottom of the first and the bottom of the sixth to wash their wealthy hands of the San Diego Padres.</description>

      <description>I know from my hit map that I have several regular readers in Israel.Â I have written a fair amount on my view of the current, and I continue to pray for Israelâs victory.
On a personal note, though, I must share with you the words of Our Lady, Mother of Israelâs savior and of mine, when, in her Canticle to her kinswoman, Elizabeth, she said:
 He has come to the aid of his servant Israel for he has remembered his promise of mercy, the promise he made to our fathers, to Abraham and his children for ever.</description>

      <description>Itâs hard to understandÂ whyÂ the United Nations in the late 1940s worked so hard to establish the Jewish state of Israel.Â Sadism?Â Since Israelâs declaration of independence, the UN has, more or less, condemned everything the country has done.Â Were Israel to play by the United Nationsâ rules, the worldâs only Jewish state would have ceased to exist several decades ago.
Still, it persists.Â TheyÂ persist, I should say.Â The government, the land, does not persist.</description>

      <description>We were all sitting in the living room, tonight, when my wife told me that my son had already chipped the veneer on his tooth. Sheâd taken him to the dentist just this afternoon.
I stormed into the kitchen where the 13-year-old boy was getting himself a glass of water.
âWhat the hell is wrong with you?â I shouted. âDo you think Iâm stupid enough to pay for orthodontics? You canât even keep your five hundred dollar teeth for four hours.</description>

      <description>The December 15 Parliamentary election in Iraq was so overwhelmingly successful that it took the New York Times editorial writers two full days to find something nasty to say about it. Not wanting to hold the bad news for the story, the headline writer did his best to explain that the recent election was a non-story, proclaiming:
Iraq Votes for a Third Time

Today, Jason on Countercolumn notices that the media are, once again, surprised&amp;ndash;this time because of the success of Iraqi parliamentary elections.
Obviously, the press is reading its own press. We on the right like claim the liberal media intentionally distorts the news to conform to its world view.</description>

      <description>Interesting story on Foxnews.com.
We all learned in grade school that the &amp;ldquo;original&amp;rdquo; Americans were those who came across the Bering Straights about 3,000 years ago. They migrated from present day Alaska to Canada, the US, Central and South America. Then the white man came from Europe, spread disease and pestilence, herded them into corrals known as reservations, raped the women and cattle, killed all the bison, cut down the pristine forests, and placed onerous taxes on all that was left standing.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s hope Ted Kennedy&amp;rsquo;s theological insights make to the Vatican before the Pope writes his homily for Midnight Mass. We&amp;rsquo;d hate to mis-catechize the Christian world by talking about Jesus when Christmas is really about hourly wages, health insurance, and campaign contributions from unions.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;We knew,&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re thinking.
Well, I didn&amp;rsquo;t. Not until tonight. I just read through half a dozen blogs, scanned or read 20 articles on MyWay.com news, and checked out all of the major network news websites.
I considered writing about thesilliness coming from Tookie Williams supporters. None of the stories I read quoted anyone who is unswervingly pro-life. No, the stories quoted people who think murderers are cool, but state laws that punish murderers with a taste of their own medicine are evil.</description>

      <description>Stanley &amp;ldquo;Tookie&amp;rdquo; Williams lived a wasted life. He chose, at an early age, to kill for money, to sell drugs, to destroy families (including his own), and to make life for others as miserable as he&amp;rsquo;d made his own. He founded a street gang and supervised its stretch from Los Angeles to almost every major city in the US. With the help of a fawning press and Hollywood, murdering for kicks in the Tookie Williams style became as glamorous as murdering for politics did with the Black Panthers.</description>

It must have pained the ABC News editors to write such a glowing headline:
Poll: Broad Optimism in Iraq
So pained, in fact, that they felt compelled to immediately qualify that statement:

      <description>Anti-Religion Religion professor, Paul Mirecki, has retained a lawyer to investigate the possibility of suing the University of Kansas for denying him rights under the First Amendment. A Law Professor reviews the possiblities for Mirecki and KU. Paul M. Secunda, an associate professor of law at University of Mississippi says Mirecki might have a difficult time building a case against KU.
 From a public employment standpoint, Mirecki would not seem to have a procedural due process claim against Kansas, as public employees are not seen as having a property interest in administrative positions such as the chairmanship of the department as opposed to having such interests in their professorial positions.</description>

      <description>The Topeka Capital-Journal  (free registration required) online has a piece that exposes Professor Paul Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s anti-religion intolerance. While I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to say his &amp;ldquo;beating&amp;rdquo; was a hoax, after reading more about the case since getting home from work, one could make the case that Mirecki used some injury as an opportunity to strike back at those he perceived to be attacking him: Christians and the media.
Consider the depth of Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s intolerance and the leading university response to Mirecki:</description>

      <description>Michelle Malkin has done great digging and found more holes in Prof. Paul Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s (see this and this) beating story than in Howard Dean&amp;rsquo;s brain.
For instance, Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s description of injuries do not match the hospitals. The police report gives very little evidence. Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s claim, that he got out of his truck to confront two yahoos who were crowding him makes little sense UNLESS Mirecki is the kind of guy who likes to settle things with his fists (which would greatly increase my respect for the guy).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a blessing that one should experience these moments. The blessing&amp;rsquo;s doubled or quadrupled when the feeling lingers with for a time, striking you like an erotic tickle at unpredictable moments throughout the days.
I was sitting on the couch watching a movie. My eyes wandered right. There, not more than five feet from me, sitting on the hearth, talking to the dog was the most beautiful, most lovable, most desirable girl-women I&amp;rsquo;ve ever laid eyes on.</description>

      <description>Amy Ridenour points a UK Guardian article explaining why Global Warming is responsible for Global Cooling. But Amy, unlike the Guardian, goes on to point out that the sun has more to do with global temperature than man does.
But, hey, she&amp;rsquo;s smarter than I am. Go read her blog.
UPDATE: I&amp;rsquo;ve added Amy&amp;rsquo;s blog to my blog roll. Therefore, you are all obliged to read it at least once a week.</description>

      <title>Prof. Paul Mirecki:  Anti-Religious Bigot</title>

      <description>Okay, I can&amp;rsquo;t claim credit for this research. Jack Cashill earns the kudos for his December 1 commentary on WorldNetDaily. As with pro-terrorist professor Ward Churchill, Mirecki has a long paper trail of opposing those with faith, particularly Catholics and Jews. Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt from Cashill&amp;rsquo;s outstanding piece.
  In response to a SOMA communicant outraged that students were distributing free Bibles on campus, Mirecki told of how he had conceived an &amp;ldquo;anti-Bible tract&amp;rdquo; to counter the Christian presence.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Hi. I&amp;rsquo;m Paul Mirecki. I hate God and everyone who prays to Him.&amp;rdquo;
According to Fox News, a University of Kansas professor who created a class designed to attack Christianity and Intelligent Design theories was beaten by a couple of thugs yesterday.
 Last week, Mirecki asked the university to cancel the class after he created a furor by sending an e-mail to a student organization mocking Christian fundamentalists.
 Mirecki had referred to religious conservatives as &amp;ldquo;fundies,&amp;rdquo; and said a course describing intelligent design as mythology would be a &amp;ldquo;nice slap in their big fat face.</description>

      <description>When your dream team defense includes the pro-Soviet, anti-American Ramsey Clark, you&amp;rsquo;re in deep trouble. Yesterday, Clark stormed out of the court room in an effort to undermine the trial, US foreign policy, and God Almighty, whom Clark seems to consider an underling. Today, he apparently advised his Hitleresque client to refuse to return to court. Saddam also told the judge to &amp;ldquo;go to hell,&amp;rdquo; according to FoxNews.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where the Constitution and case law stand on this, but it seems fitting that Clark be denied reentry into the United States.</description>

In other Dean news, Howard Dean announced thathe is betting on the terrorists and against the US Military.
&amp;ldquo;As an American, I&amp;rsquo;d love to see the Army win. As a betting man, though, I have go with my gut. I&amp;rsquo;m putting all my bets on Al Qaeda in Iraq to win and the Sunnis to place.</description>

      <description>Today I saw two Veterans for Kerry bumperstickers on my way to work. I wonder if the people who emblazoned their cars with those stickers are really veterans. If so, do they consider themselves terrorists? Their choice for CINC &amp;lsquo;04 does.
Yesterday on CBS&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Face the Nation,&amp;rdquo; Senator Kerry said
 And there is no reason, Bob, that young American soldiers need to be going into the homes of Iraqis in the dead of night, terrorizing kids and children, you know, women, breaking sort of the customs of the&amp;ndash;of&amp;ndash;the historical customs, religious customs.</description>

 In principio erat Verbum et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum. Hoc erat in principio apud Deum.

      <description>Yes, there are many other things to write about. My move to Ballwin, Missouri has interrupted both my observations of the world at large and my commenting on them. Still, a singularly inspiring photo caught my eye: The evil, hate-mongering Benedict XVI plays nice with the new Palestinian leader. When I was a cynical young man, I&amp;rsquo;d have made good humor about this. Today, though, and only by God&amp;rsquo;s beneficence, I see nothing but hope.</description>

      <description>One thing I like to do at work is to give my team members a bit of my perspective on things around holidays or significant events. Here&amp;rsquo;s my Thanksgiving message to the troops.
A wise man I once worked for, Tom Merta, had a simple yet profound view of life and work: ÂYou can get anything you want in life by helping enough other people get what they want.Â
When others demands seem overwhelming and pointless, when deadlines seem arbitrary, when commitments seem only burdens with no reward, I have to remind myself of the obvious simplicity of TomÂs motto.</description>

After all, this is the same Mahoney to bullied Mother Angelica of EWTN nearly to her grave with a false charge of Falsehood. Time has come, though, that the church militant stand up against this anti-Catholic fraud of a priest and bishop who seems bent on destroying Catholicism in Los Angeles, California.</description>

      <title>Modern Liberalism is Satanic</title>

      <description>The recent attacks onMichelle Malkin are mere evidence of the theologically unassailable fact that Satan is to modern liberalism what the KGB was to SANE/Freeze. Of course, liberals don&amp;rsquo;t believe in Satan or God or Hell or Heaven. (If the road to hell be paved with good intentions, then hell&amp;rsquo;s bowels gurgle and belch with the dyspeptic cosmic waste of those who disbelieved in eternal punishment.)
And while those calling themselves &amp;ldquo;conservatives&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;of the right&amp;rdquo; resort to base name-calling and mudslinging, it is far worse, far more self-damning, when a liberal does it.</description>

      <description>The correlation between liberalism and selfishness is too easy to make. Atheistic liberalism gives selfishness a whole new dimension. But liberals, who in their selfishness consider themselves the epitome of compassion, say you can&amp;rsquo;t measure compassion.
I utterly refute that idiot sentiment. And it is nothing more than mere sentiment.
Via FoxNews.com, we learn that folks in liberal states spend their money almost exclusively on themselves, while &amp;ldquo;Bible belt&amp;rdquo; people spend money on those who need help.</description>

      <description>In the end, the things we have amount to nothing; that which we&amp;rsquo;re left with when all our things are gone constitute everything. And our burdens are our greatest blessings.
Regular readers and friends might know that we&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling mightily for the past three years against the forces of financial destruction. In order to keep a roof over our heads and wheels in our driveway, I took advantage of every protection the law allows.</description>

      <description>Anne Rice, the occult writer who left Catholicism for vampirism (literarily) at the age of 18, has returned to the Mother Church.
In an interview with Newsweek (on MSNBC.com), Rice says that her reconversion will be the sole focus of her future writing.
 In two weeks, Anne Rice, the chronicler of vampires, witches andÂunder the pseudonym A. N. RoquelaureÂof soft-core S&amp;amp;M encounters, will publish &amp;ldquo;Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt,&amp;rdquo; a novel about the 7-year-old Jesus, narrated by Christ himself.</description>

Go to Confession.
Learn Latin.
No, these are not only my preferences, these changes are coming soon to a Mass near you.
In the 4th General Congregation of the 11th General Synod of Catholic Bishops, today, the centrality of the Eucharist, the purpose of the Synod, was central to the discussion:
  Archbishop Jan Pawel Lenga M.I.C., from Karaganda, Kazakhstan, who was persecuted for his faith during the years of soviet communism, recalled the days when the Eucharist was forced to be celebrated in secret by the faithful.</description>

      <description>WASHINGTON, D.C., SEPT. 22, 2005 (Zenit.org).- The United States and the international community must do more to bring an end to the ongoing crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan, says a U.S. bishop. Bishop John Ricard, the chairman of the U.S. episcopate&amp;rsquo;s International Policy Committee, made that statement in urging support for a &amp;ldquo;National Day of Action for the People of Darfur.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;The crisis in Darfur must be ended,&amp;rdquo; said Bishop Ricard, of Pensacola-Tallahassee, in a statement.</description>

      <description>Based on nothing more than pure hunch, I hereby leave myself open to whatever insults anyone might hurl my way by announcing my prediction for Hurricane Rita&amp;rsquo;s impact on the Gulf. In a word, anti-climax.
Before making landfall 6 hours earlier than currently projected, the hurricane will pick up speed to &amp;gt; 20 mph, weaken to &amp;lt; cat. 3 and make landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border as a mid-category 2.</description>

      <description>When I was a runner, I took part in many runs to support various charities. One I never joined was the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. Not because I oppose breast cancer research, but because something about that particular organization rubbed me the wrong way. For one thing, it seemed too big, too intrusive. It was like a charity version of the AFL-CIO, before it collapsed.

      <description>How timely was Tom&amp;rsquo;s blog on the Latin Mass?
I just received this holy news from Karl Keating&amp;rsquo;s newsletter:
 Last Thursday Catholic World News transmitted this story, filed out of Dublin, regarding what might happen to what is commonly called the Tridentine Mass:
 &amp;ldquo;Pope Benedict XVI will take action soon to allow all Catholic priests to celebrate the Latin Mass, a Cambridge historian has predicted.
&amp;ldquo;Speaking to a conference of priests in Ireland earlier this week, Eamonn Duffy said that it was &amp;lsquo;extremely likely that Pope Benedict will lift the restrictions on the celebration of the Tridentine liturgy,&amp;rsquo; the Irish Independent reported.</description>

      <description>TheNew York Times Online, today, is drumming up sympathy for abortion.
 Venetia Grunder, 21, viewed an ultrasound image of the fetus in her womb. She was 12 weeks pregnant, though she had taken birth control pills as directed. &amp;ldquo;I feel pretty messed up,&amp;rdquo; she said after seeing the image. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s different, just knowing. My husband told me not to look. This changes my feelings, but I&amp;rsquo;m sticking by it. Damn it, $650, I&amp;rsquo;m sticking by it.</description>

      <description>Listening to Fr. Frank Pavone&amp;rsquo;s homily on EWTN&amp;rsquo;s daily Mass today, my mind wandered to the Roberts confirmation hearing. Well, not to Roberts&amp;rsquo;s, but to another Supreme Court nonimee&amp;rsquo;s: a nominee whose public statements on Roe vs. Wade tow the liberal line.
Chairman: The chair yields to the senior Senator from Missouri for ten minutes. Senator Bond.
Bond: Thank you Mr. Chairman, colleagues, Judge Smeal. (Sifting through notes) Judge Smeal, have you ever seen photos or diagrams of an abortion in progress?</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, men and women separated themselves from society in order to pray. Often, their piety attracted like-minded individuals to join them. Among early Christians, the practice became fairly common, and continued through the middle ages and even after the Reformation. While that may not be an official definition of monasticism, it fits.
One can only imagine that forming a new religious order was easier in the days of the great kings of Europe than it would be today.</description>

      <description>You see them. They&amp;rsquo;re knocking each other down to blame Katrina and its aftermath on Bush. They&amp;rsquo;re lying, of course. They&amp;rsquo;re Democrats; they can&amp;rsquo;t help themselves.
Genius isn&amp;rsquo;t required to see that the relief efforts in Republican-conrolled Mississippi, with far more storm damage than Louisiana, is relatively smooth. Like Florida&amp;rsquo;s Jeb Bush, Haley Barbour seems to know what he&amp;rsquo;s doing.
Next door in Louisiana, there&amp;rsquo;s another story. Democrat run, Democrat destroyed Louisiana is a shambles.</description>

      <description>The people at Planned Parenthood are the kinds of cowards who give cowardice a bad name.
Dawn Eden demonstrated, today, how Planned Parenthood tried to divert money for Katrina Relief into their own abortion mills. Now, if you&amp;rsquo;re eugenicist, racist, baby-killer like those who run and support and profit from Planned Parenthood, then the their logic will make sense:
 a) Most of the really, really brutalized victims of Katrina we saw on television were poor blacks; b) if there weren&amp;rsquo;t so darn many poor blacks, the hurricane&amp;rsquo;s effect would have been far less catastrophic; therefore, c) if we prevent poor blacks from breeding, we will avoid future Katrinas.</description>

      <description>A week ago yesterday, anticipating KatrinaÂs arrival on the Gulf Coast, I penned the following paragraph on this blog:
 Perhaps we fortunate souls in the rest of the country should begin a ring of volunteers willing to put up a displaced person or family until they can get back on their feet. IÂm sure the government will help relocate folks. While St. Louis isnÂt exactly LouisiannaÂs backyard, our door is open to such a family in need.</description>

      <description>With perhaps 10,000 dead in the Gulf Coast, it seems almost silly to talk about one man&amp;rsquo;s death. But the man who died first came to our attention with bushy sideburns, thick glasses, and wide lapels.
William Rehnquist was never a politician. He was just a judge. His devotion to the Constitution was amazing. He never deviated from his path of original understanding and legislsative intent. When Rehnquist authored an opinion, it was right in the eyes of the law, in the eyes of democracy, and in the eyes of God.</description>

      <description>Police looting for food. People starving to death. The first of the Red Cross aid arrived in Biloxi, Mississippi only tonight, four days after the hurricane. Scarborough says he&amp;rsquo;s been involved in many hurricane relief efforts, and he&amp;rsquo;s never seen one this unresponsive.
In New Orleans, there are very few Guardsmen, police, doctors visible. Several doctors left the Super Dome, unable to treat people because of the violence. One doctor reported the problem of the bodies of murder victims: four Wednesday night, four Tuesday, maybe more.</description>

      <description>I know many will disagree with me, but must agree with Ron Fournier of the AP:
 At every turn, political leaders failed Katrina&amp;rsquo;s victims. They didn&amp;rsquo;t strengthen the levees. They ceded the streets to marauding looters. They left dead bodies to rot or bloat. Thousands suffered or died for lack of water, food and hope. Who&amp;rsquo;s at fault?
 There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of blame to go around - the White House, Congress, federal agencies, local governments, police and even residents of the Gulf Coast who refused orders to evacuate.</description>

      <description>The Department of Homeland Security just faced its first major test in New Orleans. It failed miserably.
No one is in charge. Looters, gangs, thugs, and murders rule the streets. (See Michelle Malkin: Can Law and Order Be Restored?) Police and other supposed officials have no instructions on what to do with refugees, who are herded from one street gang war to another. Days-old-babies are boiling in the sun while police yell at their helpless mothers to keep moving toward the danger zones.</description>

As a Christian, I believe that all love, charity, and kindness comes from God. But we have free will to pass it along or to use it all on ourselves. For that matter, we can reject it completely. Today&amp;rsquo;s response demonstrates the American people, at least many of them, are passing along God&amp;rsquo;s graces in buckets.</description>

I have been running Firefox on both Linux (SuSE&amp;rsquo;s latest) and Windows (XP Pro SP2) since beta days. With each release and each patch, I expect the uncountable list of problems to abate. Instead, the list grows only longer.
On Windows, Firefox has plenty of plug-ins, though not enough. It freezes constantly.</description>

      <description>In the continuing story of the resurgence of Roman Catholicism, Newsweek online reports on an orthodox Catholic frat at Franciscan University: Knights of the Holy Queen.
Many on the Catholic right have long argued the church&amp;rsquo;s decline began with Pope Paul&amp;rsquo;s misguided reform of the Holy Mass in 1968. During the 1970s, Catholic dioceses and parishes in the Western world purged their sanctuaries of Christ, the Crucifix, the Blessed Mother, God, prayer, reverence, and holiness, replacing these &amp;ldquo;relics&amp;rdquo; with worship of the profane, the creature, the created.</description>

      <description>I have a child who suffers from many neurological infirmities. He attends a prestigious school district in St. Louis County, Missouri. Several times, I have expressed my disappointment in the way some administrators in his former middle school, from which he has since matriculated, handled his problems.
For his privacy, I never referred to the child in question as my son. I never used his name. And for their privacy, I never named the administrators with whom I disagreed.</description>

      <description>Jay Anderson illuminates a blood-boiler involving Viacom and Mother Teresa. (The fact that so many anti-theists so despise a woman who did nothing but good her entire life should tell us a lot about these people.)
Penn and Teller aired a show in which they called Mother Teresa a &amp;ldquo;f*ing ct.&amp;rdquo; The Catholic League protested. Viacom promised to never air the episode again.
But Viacom&amp;rsquo;s president, Sumner Redstone, wanted the last word.</description>

      <description>C. S. Lewis makes a compelling argument that perfect love is perfect wisdom&amp;ndash;or knowledge or understanding. You&amp;rsquo;d have to read his whole thing, which I encourage you to do. (I think it&amp;rsquo;s from The Four Loves.) I firmly believe that, and have since I read it&amp;ndash;not that I doubt much of what Lewis wrote.
Futher, since God is love, then in God, and only in God, can we find love. Or is it Love?</description>

      <description>As readers know, my family treks almost 40 miles most Sundays to attend the Tridentine indult Mass at St. Francis de Sales Oratory in South St. Louis. I have personally expressed my thanks to his Excellency, Archbishop Raymond Burke, for allowing us this beautiful and holy Mass in such a splendid work of art. The blessings of Archbishop Burke continue to flow. In addition to St. Francis de Sales, West St.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, I craved Holy Communion. Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind being the ONLY PERSON IN THE CHURCH who doesn&amp;rsquo;t go up to receive the true Body and Blood of our savior each mass. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m kind of proud of that. While there&amp;rsquo;s nothing honorable about being the only person in the church in a state of mortal sin (there&amp;rsquo;s hell to pay), but there is some honor, I think, in being the only one, at least at Daily Mass, to admit it.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s not that I&amp;rsquo;m terribly old, it&amp;rsquo;s just that I have no friends. I used to. But I&amp;rsquo;ve lost them all. Not all through death, but through life. Well, some through death, for sure.</description>

      <description>Safety.
Women want to feel safe. They seek out men who can protect them. Sorry, but it&amp;rsquo;s true.
When a woman feels that her man can no longer protect her or their children, she has no use for him. Humor, cooking, intellect, whatever other qualities he might have become meaningless. They were only perquisites stacked atop his primary attraction: safety.
Want to know why young, beautiful women are atrracted to wealthy old men?</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that I was only two when Peter Jennings became the anchor of ABC&amp;rsquo;s Nightly News. It was 1965, before the 60s began. Timothy Leary was still at Harvard, and Viet Nam was still an opportunity to thwart communism&amp;rsquo;s uholy advance.
Jennings didn&amp;rsquo;t last long. Berated by critics as a pretty face, ABC demoted him to foreign correspondent in 1968. In London, Munich, Brussels, and other foreign capitals, Jennings paid his dues.</description>

      <description>The only liberator of women in history was Jesus Christ. Catholics are accused, falsely, of worshiping His mother, Mary. We venerate Mary. We ask His mother to pray for us, to intercede with Him on our behalf. We try to imitate her faith and obedience&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;Be it done unto me according to thy word.&amp;rdquo; And most of us usually fall way, way short.
When I read a poll showing that 2/3 of the adults in a Catholic church on any given Sunday are women, I was struck by the ratio.</description>

      <description>The Roman Catholic Episcopate is set to introduce sweeping changes to the Latin Rite liturgy during its General Synod, October 2 through October 23, 2005.
According to the agendum for the synod, which Catholics should read here, the following points will be addressed:
* Intensive catechesis on the importance of keeping the Holy Days of Obligation, particularly the Sunday requirement. * Dignity, due preparation, and faith in the mystery of the Eucharist * The secularization of salvation and religious relativism * Understanding that &amp;quot;participation&amp;quot; in the Mass centers on receiving the Body and Blood of Christ the Redeemer, not standing in the sanctuary with your hands in the air in imitation of a priest.</description>

First, I want to publicly thank Our Lady for her gracious intercession. I know that if my request is not opposed to God&amp;rsquo;s holy Will, it will be done.
Second, just in case, if you happen to be praying for things, please drop my name with the Almighty.</description>

Paul Krugman decided to maliciously call Alabama a state full of illiterates who needed pictures to understand a story. Thus, claims Krugman, Toyota had to build a new car plant in Canada&amp;ndash;Alabama lacked a literate workforce.</description>

Israeli intelligence reports that the large network of al-Qaeda web sites, the organizations primary means of international communication, have been taken out of service. The Israelis believe UK intelligence did the Lord&amp;rsquo;s work on this case, reports the Times of London.
 Over the past fortnight Israeli intelligence agents have noticed something distinctly odd happening on the internet. One by one, Al-QaedaÂs affiliated websites have vanished until only a handful remain, write Uzi Mahnaimi and Alex Pell.</description>

 BALLYMENA, NORTHERN IRELAND, Ireland, July 27 (CNA) - Tuesday saw what police have called a wave of intimidation attacks against Catholics in and around Ballymena, a mostly Protestant town northwest of Belfast.
 The Associated Press reported that Protestant extremists planted a homemade grenade outside a Catholic family&amp;rsquo;s home in Ballymena. The bomb detonated, causing minor damage. Arsonists badly damaged one Catholic-run pub in the village of Martinstown, and caused minor fire damage to the outside of another pub in nearby Rasharkin with two gasoline-filled bottles.</description>

Michelle Malkin has done a great job on this story, finding the loopholes in Franken&amp;rsquo;s loopholes.
Those of us who always assume the worst motives of limosine liberals are alway right. There&amp;rsquo;s a satisfying justice in that, like when we learned that Barbara Streisand believes people like her are exempt from the need to protect the environment, or when theDave Matthews Band illegally dumps human feces all over boaters in Chicago.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday, Pope Benedict XVI spoke to Italian clergy, and his statements seem, at first blush, rather sad. He told the assembled that Christian churches in the West appear to be dying. In particular, the so-called mainline Protestant churches have been losing members for nearly a century.
Jay Anderson at Pro Ecclesia conjectures:
 &amp;ldquo;Mainstream churches&amp;rdquo; appear to be dying. Well, then, they aren&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo;, are they? Just like the dying &amp;ldquo;mainstream media&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo;.</description>

How retired Royal Military College professor Bob Ferguson reached the exhaulted heights of stupidity from which he now pontificates is uncertain, but chances are education helped.
Mr. Ferguson has called upon the Canadian government to regulate religion in that country, especially the Roman Catholic Church. Succumbing to the whispers of the dark one, Ferguson let loose this commentary on CBC radio:</description>

      <description>So it appears. According to Michelle Malkin, Ed Morrissey, Brian Maloney, The Bronx News, and other sources, several federally supported relief agencies in New York have been illegally funelling hundreds of thousands of dollars to Al Franken&amp;rsquo;s anti-American radio network Air America.
The agencies in question, Gloria Wise Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club and Pathways for Youth Boys &amp;amp; Girls clubs.
 One source told the News that $480,000 in funds from the Gloria Wise Club is involved in the cityÂs investigation of illegal transfer of funds from the local club.</description>

      <description>I wish I could give the details, but that would cause problems. Suffice it to say that two weeks ago, something my wife and I had been praying hard for seemed to have been placed out of reach. If that was God&amp;rsquo;s answer to our prayers, it was a resounding &amp;ldquo;Get lost.&amp;rdquo;
Thankfully, though, we didn&amp;rsquo;t stop. I went straight to the perpetual adoration chapel and knelt before the exposed Body of Christ for an hour and a half.</description>

      <description>No, really, of course. RomanCatholicBlog tells us at the the next time the Bishops get together, they might, just might, address the problem of horrible, rancid, loud, profane music at Mass.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure all those who have complained about the music weren&amp;rsquo;t inspired by my blog. More likely, they were inspired by the same Holy Ghost that inspired me.</description>

      <description>Since the beginning of the labor union movement, the greatest threat it felt&amp;ndash;often paranoically&amp;ndash;was management (or the Republicans) &amp;ldquo;breaking&amp;rdquo; the union. The external threat was seen to come from anti-union laws, movement of jobs overseas, and negotiating tactics that left union strikes powerless. Now, it seems, that the union movement may, like communism, collapse from its own weight.
After a steady 20+ year decline in union membership, the flagship of organized labor, the AFL-CIO, fractured this week, losing more than 1/3 of its membership.</description>

      <description>We know that Dick Durbin hates members of the US Armed Forces. We know that he hates personal property and freedom. Now we learn how much he hates unborn children. From Jay Anderson, via NewsMax, via NBC, we learn Durbin considers being pro-life as a disqualifying defect for any judge.
I wonder how many abortions his wife and children account for? After all, if abortions are such wonderful things, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t he want the women he loves have a few?</description>

      <description>My weekly attack on Catholic liturgical abuse needs some caveats:
* I accept the teaching of the Second Vatican Council as bound in heaven as on earth. * I accept the validity of the New Mass based on the church&#39;s Magisterium and the indefectability of the church. * I do not believe that people who attend (by choice) New Mass are living outside the faith.  A wedding this weekend left us no choice but to attend the 5:30 PM &amp;ldquo;LIFETeen&amp;rdquo; mass at our local parish.</description>

Does anyone know what the deal is? Is she famous for anything besides blogging?</description>

      <description>In the Museum of Left-Wing Lunacy we find a blood-boiling story of typical Democrat callous hatefulness.
Pennsylvania Lt. Governor Catherine Baker Knoll is the sort of thing one scrapes from the bottom of a shoe. She crashed the funeral mass of fallen Marine Sgt. Joseph Goodrich to campaign for office and to chastise the family of the fallen hero, saying &amp;ldquo;our government opposes this war.&amp;rdquo;
 She sat down next to a Goodrich family member and, during the distribution of communion, said, &amp;ldquo;Who are you?</description>

      <description>The National Cancer Institute funded a Chinese study that links induced abortion to a signficantly increased risk of breast cancer. But the results were politically incorrect, so the NCI buried the study, according to Purposeful Dreamer.
It appears, now, the NCI is removing all copies of the study from the internet in a Soviet-style attempt to whitewash history. Still, pdf copies remain, and here is a link to one.

      <description>The Canadian Conference of Bishops bravely demanded that Catholics continue to resist Canada&amp;rsquo;s attempt to redifine marriage.
 Catholics are to continue to oppose it, and to ensure that all provincial and territorial regulations on the solemnization of marriages provide full protection for freedom of conscience and religion, as guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
 Meanwhile, in Spain, a judge, Laura Alabau, has refused to marry a lesbian couple and is appealing to that country&amp;rsquo;s high court to overturn the law.</description>

      <description>TheUnited Nations Population Fund as declared that abstinence and contraception do not work in reducing poverty. Therefore, it declares, a massive increase in abortions is the only way to curb economic privation.
Folks, the United Nations is the largest, most powerful force for evil in the world. Pressure your political leaders to withdraw from this cancerous legion of death.
UPDATE: Dovetailing perfectly into this story, The Dawn Patrol, with the help of commenters, points out that sex education is proven to cause an increase in unplanned pregnancies.</description>

      <description>My first foray into editing Wikipedia happened when I found some really bad etymology of St. Peter&amp;rsquo;s name. Following the misteaching of some Protestant theology, a well-meaning soul had written that Christ Jesus gave Symon the name &amp;ldquo;Petros,&amp;rdquo; then turned to a rocky cliff and said, &amp;ldquo;And upon this petra I will build my church.&amp;rdquo; (Since my edits, though, the entry has been radically altered.)
Petros, in Greek, is a little rock.</description>

      <description>Now that Canada has made homosexual &amp;ldquo;marriage&amp;rdquo; the law of the land, it won&amp;rsquo;t be long before Catholic priests are imprisoned for refusing to preside over such blasphemy. Though Canadian Liberals assure us that the law applies specifically to &amp;ldquo;civil&amp;rdquo; marriages, there is no protection against civil suits against priests who refuse to conduct homosexual marriage ceremonies. And we all know how much liberals enjoy suing.
The good news is that the situation may provide an opportunity for Canadian martyrs, of which there are few.</description>

      <description>Another cowardly attack on our closest ally&amp;rsquo;s capital city.
MSNBC reports that Tony Blair has appealed for calm. That seems superfluous in England where the good people showed such commendable fortitude after the last bombs.
Thanks to God, the human toll was much lower this time:
 Only one person was reported wounded in Thursday&amp;rsquo;s blasts, but Blair said the intention of the attacks must have been to kill.
 And one of the bombers, this time, may have survived the attack.</description>

Last week, Michelle Malkin and Captain Ed jumped all over Senator Rick Santorum for his 2002 editorial about the moral depravity of Boston, Massachusetts. At the risk of accusations of laying it on, I have concluded that Michelle and Ed were miles far off base in their knee-jerk defenses of Boston.

Today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel helped me understand. Jesus wept for Jerusalem. They were so wrapped up in themselves that they could not recognize their Messiah when he stood before them. They turned God&amp;rsquo;s temple into a &amp;ldquo;den of thieves.&amp;rdquo; American Catholics have turned the New Jerusalem, the church Christ built with his blood and tears, into a den of thieves.</description>

Specifically, he has fought a losing battle against a pair of Extraordinary Eucharistic Ministers who distribute Holy Communion in his parish. The pair is a &amp;ldquo;married&amp;rdquo; gay male couple. They are openly gay, they carry on public displays of affection in during Mass.</description>

I hope Pope Benedict&amp;rsquo;s roadmap will drive the likes of Fr. Richard McBrien to some church where he belongs. His snotty attack on conservatives deserves scorn from all corners of the Catholic church.
McBrien considers liberal Catholics mentally healthy, well-adjusted, and intelligent.</description>

In 2002, at the peak of the Cardinal Law Boston priest sex abuse scandal, Santorum passed at least some of the blame for the Boston church&amp;rsquo;s licentiousness on the prevailing &amp;ldquo;anything goes&amp;rdquo; attitude of Boston, its people, and its environs.</description>

      <description>St. Rita&amp;rsquo;s parents picked a husband for her when she as 15. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good choice, though. He beat her, gambled away their money, and carried on open affairs with other women. They had two children. Rita had wanted to enter the convent until her parents told her to marry this man. Her sons, despite Rita&amp;rsquo;s Christian teachings, followed the ways of their father.
Rita&amp;rsquo;s husband was mortally stabbed. He converted on his death bed, as did her two wayward sons who died shortly thereafter.</description>

      <description>The Satanic National Abortion Rights Action League (SNARAL) is now picketing crisis pregnancy centers to try to intimidate pregnant Christians into committing murder. No, I&amp;rsquo;m not kidding, and neither is the Dawn Patrol where my wife found this sickening story. Please read the entire blog and follow the excellent links. They will help contribute to pro-life organizations trying to counter SNARAL&amp;rsquo;s murderous designs.
One of these demons enjoins us to &amp;ldquo;See how beautiful we looked.</description>

      <description>Regular readers might expect me to rant against the AARP, as I at least monthly. But this time, their altruism is commendable.
By endorsing euthenasia for the elderly, the AARP has admitted that it serves no worthwhile purpose and must be put to sleep.
Certainly, just disbanding would be the moral thing to do. But if the AARP insists on disbanding by suicide, who am I to get their way?</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s one of Hitch&amp;rsquo;s reactions to the London Bombing:
 We know very well what the &amp;ldquo;grievances&amp;rdquo; of the jihadists are.
 The grievance of seeing unveiled women. The grievance of the existence, not of the State of Israel, but of the Jewish people. The grievance of the heresy of democracy, which impedes the imposition of sharia law. The grievance of a work of fiction written by an Indian living in London.</description>

      <description>This quote from Neal Pollack is two years old, but I just found it. I like it so much, I&amp;rsquo;m blogging it in hopes that no one will ever forget what an idiot Howard Dean is.
 It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why people are seduced by Howard Dean. He&amp;rsquo;s well-spoken, handsome, and sensible. He appears to have a strong grasp on most major issues, a willingness to compromise with his opponents, and the gift of not getting flustered by minor annoyances.</description>

This afternoon I joined ProLifeBlogs.org and tonight, on that blog, I found the thrust of a theory the theological side of my brain has been pondering for some time (though it&amp;rsquo;s not time to expose it just yet):

Everyone who likes Michael Moore is an idiot. Okay, everyone except the anti-Americans who pretend to be idiots.
This week thanks to Moore&amp;rsquo;s al-Qaida heroes, he looked like a compete moron. Why? Because Moore claims terrorism is a red-herring, an invention. The Twin Towers? Computer graphics. If your husband disappeared on 9/11, it&amp;rsquo;s because he ran off with his secretary.</description>

      <description>According to Religious News Service and Christian News, Jewish satirical rapper, 50 Shekel, after viewing Mel Gibson&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Passion of the Christ&amp;rdquo; has accepted Christ Jesus as the Messiah.
 Messianic Jews, like Christians, believe that Jesus (or as they refer to him, Y&amp;rsquo;Shua) was the expected Messiah. Though they claim to be following the true Judaism, mainstream Jews are nearly unanimous in rejecting the idea that Messianic Jews are Jewish, and many believe them to be Christians intentionally targeting Jews for conversion.</description>

      <description>London Bombing Watching the news of the miserable murders in London, I am reminded, oddly, of the other Bombing of Britain. After weeks of torturous air raids on London and its suburbs, Nazi Germany surely thought that English stood on the brink of collapse.
But in the midst of the carnage, terror, and mayhem, Prime Minister Winston Churchill found the time to address the people of the United States. He encouraged us to keep a stiff upper lip.</description>

They worship lies, evil, disintegration, and ugliness. Sulfur is their perfume. Cancer is their aphrodesiac. Excrement is their fine art. And merciless murder of children is their unholy sacrament. Compared to members of NARAL, hardcore Nazis were alter boys.
Their latest attack on truth, beauty, good, and unity is their Screw Abstinence campaign.</description>

But they aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid of spening eternity burning in the fires of hell.
I pray the Holy spirit descends upon these pitiful souls. They are truly worthy of our most profound prayers. I pray for those United Church of Christ leaders who prefer the praise of Satan over the promises of Christ.</description>

      <description>Yeah, I know. But when a major news network (NBC) equates America&amp;rsquo;s Founders with Usama bin Laden and the only people to react are conservatives, maybe this great experiment in self-governance has failed.
It seems to me that the only remaining battle is The God Fearing vs. Everyone Else. If I have to die for something I believe in, better God than the people who watch NBC news.

According to UCC Rules Committee member, Nancy Ballabeuster, &amp;ldquo;God could not have foreseen such changes in human relationships as we&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed in the past 30 years. We know that God is love, and as such She would want us to have a Bible that makes everyone feel good about herself, regardless of sexual orientation, race, or criminal activity.</description>

      <description>Your Excellency:
Thank you for giving us the Tridentine Mass at the beautiful St. Francis de Sales church.
I grew up, mostly, in the Novus Ordo Missae. Over the past 30 years, I have seen the Mass go from a reverent, prayerful worship of God, to a social gathering, to, now, something that seems more like a baseball game. I use Perpetual Adoration, the daily Rosary, and novenas to pray, because prayer during Mass has become almost impossible.</description>

The vestibule is dark and reverent, not grand at all. It might be the foyer of an old, downtown office building except for the small stained-glass windows. Then to the inner doors, smaller, but heavy and wooden.</description>

Sadly, there was really a Roman Catholic Cardinal, Jaime L. Cardinal Sin, who passed away.
He must have been very holy man. Imagine the Holy spirit&amp;rsquo;s work at convincing a Pope to promote someone named Sin to Cardinal.</description>

Until very recently, the Church of England was more closely united with the Roman Catholic church than any mainstream Protestant church.
It is because of the Anglican church&amp;rsquo;s proximity to Rome that I desire its internal reformation.

Is it possible that the most dangerous thing on earth is the believer who doesn&amp;rsquo;t trust God?
Someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in God is capable of doing great harm to himself, his family, and his community.</description>

      <description>Thanks toRomanCatholicBlog, I found this essay on abused liturgy by one of my heroes, Fr. James Schall, author of &amp;ldquo;Another Sort of Learning.&amp;rdquo;
Father&amp;rsquo;s Day, we attended Mass with my in-laws, including my wife&amp;rsquo;s grandfather, in Illinois. Instead of a homily, the priest decided to (ab)use that portion of the Holy Sacrifice to conduct a survey. Ushers passed out forms like baseball All-Star ballots. Those of us who were not members of the parish were left to sit and pray amongst ourselves while the parishioners applied their number 2 pencils to the little dots.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a certified apologist or anything, but after 15 years of Catholic education I have a pretty good headful of catechetics. I think the reason I never actually asked my wife to become Catholic was that I enjoyed my position as household expert on the church. My wife is a lot smarter than I am, much better educated, and much dedicated to the things she finds important.
A month and a half ago, she began &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo; about becoming Catholic.</description>

      <description>Last night, I was lucky enough to have my second hour before the exposed Eucharist in one week. My wife was out of town with the kids, so I took her place.
My usual hour is in the morning, before work. The sun is up, the room is bright. It&amp;rsquo;s like Easter morning.
But in the evening, it&amp;rsquo;s different. It&amp;rsquo;s more like the Agony in the Garden. The room seems larger and darker.</description>

      <description>Hey, I realize that my readership has dropped from about 1,000 a day to a handful a day since I left the world of politics to concentrate on God. I don&amp;rsquo;t care. Well, I do. It&amp;rsquo;s symptomatic of the reason I turned toward God: this world loves sin, lies, and death. It hates goodness, truth, and life.
In my return to the Holy Mother church, I am so fortunate that my parish has a Perpetual Adoration chapel.</description>

      <description>Tonight in Guatamala, in a place lush with plants and beauty such that one from the comfortable but dry Midwestern United States might think &amp;ldquo;paradise&amp;rdquo; on first glance, lies a little girl. Her family has so little. The floor of their tin-roofed house is dirt. She has a matress, I understand. She like to sing and dance. She&amp;rsquo;s four and beautiful.
Dearest Lord Jesus, you love little ones so dearly. They are our spiritual mentors.</description>

Father, I can see beauty in your heart. I have read the testimony of your parishoners, and I can see that you bring people to Jesus. How gratifying that must be, Father. I wish I could touch so many souls.</description>

And yet, You forgive. In the abyss of Your fathomless mercy, You find a way to forgive me for my transgressions&amp;ndash;my creative, evil, flesh-thrilling transgressions.
How do I repay You? An eternity of homage would be too little.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get on a rant against Episcopalians, here, but RomanCatholicBlog and Ex-Pagan bring us links to a travesty in an Episcopal church that I must point out.
I know some took offence at my original swipe at the Anglican church last week. I even felt a little writer&amp;rsquo;s remorse, thinking, maybe, I&amp;rsquo;d been over the top. But God works, sometimes, in obvious ways. Aside from tacking a list of 95 Antitheses to their own heads and declaring God dead, I cannot think of surer way than The Clown Eurcharist to demonstrate to the world that one considers his own religion a joke.</description>

Reading his letter to the parish, I felt the hair on the back of my neck rise to attention. Some months ago, I nearly joined the very church Rev. Kimel is leaving. Thank you, God, for sparing me that humiliation, though I fully deserve the humiliation I would have felt.

      <description>The Friday before John Paul II died, EWTN aired a documentary about Polish saints. For me, the most fascinating was St. Maria Faustina Kowalska, canonized by Pope John Paul II in 2000.
Her diary, at 700 pages, is the most powerful testimony of faith I have ever read. Those who do not understand the joy of suffering for God must read this work of pure faith. Before I picked up the text last month, I was familiar with the phrase &amp;ldquo;offer it up.</description>

      <description>While reading the links from the Nunsense story on RomanCatholicBlog, I found this. I have only skimmed it so far, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good story, well written, timely, and encouraging.
Conversion stories are among the most importat to reinforcing faith. All of the Epistles, really, were testimony to conversions of Jews, pagans, Greeks, Romans, and others. We learn so much about our faith from those who came to faith as adults or who returned after being adrift in secular confusion.</description>

Closer, though, she&amp;rsquo;s not as young as I thought. But even more beautiful. Pushing her cart through the supermarket, studying various reliefs for indigestion, her back to the world, to me, I wanted to catch her eye and just say &amp;ldquo;hello.&amp;rdquo; But I chickened out.</description>

      <description>Tear a banana from a bunch and show it to someone. Ask them to identify it.
ÂThatÂs a banana,Â theyÂll say.
Now, peel the banana, hold up the fruit, and ask them what it is.
ÂA banana,Â theyÂll say, probably somewhat confused at your obvious questions.
Set aside the fruit and hold up the peel. Once again, ask them to identify what you hold.
ÂA banana peel.Â
The banana is a banana without its peel, but the peel is not a banana without its fruit.</description>

      <description>Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska adored silence. Only through her special relationship with Jesus Christ could she find the inner strength to pray, to contemplate, worship, and hear God, amid the ÂdinÂ of her convent. I can only imagine the cacophony of that house of nuns.
With MotherÂs Day commitments abound, I was reduced to attending 5:30 Mass tonight. I lasted 10 minutesÂ18 if you count the time before the Mass started.</description>

Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve felt a pang of guilt for leaving the Blessed Mother out dry. She would never do that to me&amp;ndash;and that explains much about her role.</description>

Now is the time to send pig skins to Iraq with the promise that any terrorist&amp;ndash;captured or killed&amp;ndash;will be sewn into the animal&amp;rsquo;s skin and buried. This will go for the remains of suicide bombers as well as those killed in combat or captured and executed.</description>

      <description>Chesterton, comparing and contrasting Sts. Francis of Assisi with St. Thomas Aquinas, said, &amp;ldquo;[I]t is the paradox of history that each generation is converted by the saint who contradicts it most.&amp;rdquo;
Chesterton was not a prophet, but a genius. As such, his observations of history serve as predictions of the future. Pope John Paul II became pope when detente was still in the air, when Jimmy Carter was urging the world to accept the perpetualism of Soviet communism, when Americans were told that our best days were behind us.</description>

      <description>Recently, a very good man, a Bishop in the Old Catholic church, wrote to me about his concern that I live in fear of God rather than in the light of God&amp;rsquo;s infinite love and mercy. His message made me realize that I had been, up to that point, too vague about how to fear God. I wrote him:
 Thank you. Your words are comforting, though I don&amp;rsquo;t have much fear of God, except the kind of fear one naturally has toward something of incomprehensible greatness.</description>

Oh Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love; for it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life.</description>

      <description>When liberals, or those they like, perform some public act in order garner temporary respect from particular group, the press calls it &amp;ldquo;a profound symbolic gesture.&amp;rdquo; When a conservative does the same thing, it&amp;rsquo;s called a &amp;ldquo;callous act of hypocritical pandering.&amp;rdquo; We can&amp;rsquo;t win on the symbolic gesture front.
Today on EWTN Radio (that&amp;rsquo;s a Catholic national radio network), a caller recommended that Pope Benedict take the lead in singing popular songs at televised Masses.</description>

      <description>Liberal Catholics in America want a church that promotes contraception, abortion, homosexuality, promiscuity, greed, lust, dishonesty, sloth, and the rest of the mortal sins.
So, why have a church?
How indicative of our selfishness, our vainglory, to ask our churches to read the Bible then teach the opposite. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that what the devil is for?

Already theleft media in the USA (J. Rob)is denouncing the selection of Joseph Ratzinger as new pope. CBS News called him &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rsquo;s Rottweiler,&amp;rdquo; an obvious play on his German nationality. That term was echoed by other networks and news agency, indicating that the term is part of talking points distributed by anti-Catholic liberals in the United States.
A couple of weeks ago, people argued with me about who the Cardinals would choose.</description>

      <description>Undoubtedly, high fuel costs in their 3rd year (and 4th of 5) will drive up costs overall. But the Fed is promising to attack inflation aggressively. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise, then, that wages are falling (against cost of living).
The reduced disposable income numbers has hurt sale of snack foods, candy, soft drinks. The Dow is about to dip below 10,000.
Perhaps the Fed needs to allow cash to rise to levels consistent with the real cost of fuel.</description>

      <description>Several St. Louis area gas stations are selling high-ethanol gasoline for $0.85 a gallon. That&amp;rsquo;s eighty-five cents a gallon. How can they sell this alternative to Saudi Arabian oil so cheaply? According to the AP
 Ethanol prices have declined sharply in recent months, largely because of the rapid growth in supply and few new markets. Shaw maintains that refiners are ignoring ethanol and keeping the additive out of some markets where it is readily available.</description>

      <description>In Illinois, quickly becoming the most leftist state in the union, Planned Parenthood and other infanticide supporters, are pushing a bill through the state&amp;rsquo;s legislature that will make it more difficult for pregnant women to obtain ultrasounds, according to the _Illinois Leader _via Jack Lewis.
Why?
Because seeing a picture of an unborn child tends to turn women against whimsical murder&amp;ndash;the chief form of amusement for Planned Parenthood.

      <description>A seemingly drunk Ward Churchill is spewing bizarre conspiracy theories on C-SPAN, taped March 25, 2005. He claims that 6 in 10 New Yorkers believe that September 11 was perpetrated by the US Government. He went on to say that he won&amp;rsquo;t give &amp;ldquo;white guys&amp;rdquo; credit for the attacks until he has proof.
He&amp;rsquo;s having a very difficult time reading the questions.

      <description>Most people who dabble in politics and political writing can point to one defining moment, one event, one story that crystallized some nebulous thoughts into a clear, palatable drive to do something. If you were born in 1963, the youngest of four, and you watched the excesses of the 1960s rip your older sisters from your parents, you share a lot with me.

      <description>Politics used to end at the water&amp;rsquo;s edge. Now it ends at the treatment room.
Peter Jennings announced today that he has lung cancer&amp;ndash;the deadliest cancer of them all.
Many who read this blog detest Jennings&amp;rsquo;s politics, as do I. But Peter Jennings&amp;rsquo;s life hasn&amp;rsquo;t been all roses. When Don Imus made fun of his marital situation a few years ago, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t laugh. Perhaps Imus had never loved. Or perhaps he&amp;rsquo;d been spared the pain of a love that blinded him to the treachery of the object of his affection.</description>

Then the Pope died.
I sat here for a couple of hours trying to think of something to write. I thought of much. Unfortunately, none of the things would interest readers.
There&amp;rsquo;s been too much death lately. Minnesota, Terri Schiavo, little girls in Nebraska and Florida, the Pope, even Johnnie Cochran.</description>

      <description>The Vatican just announced that the Pope suffered heart failure earlier this evening. Dr. Arthur St. Andre says that he may . . . may . . . be surviving only on his IV to keep his blood pressure up. The Vatican describes the pontiff as seriously ill but lucid and comfortable. There are reports that doctors recommended he return to the hospital, but he personally declined. Obviously, he wants to die at what has been his home for the past quarter century.</description>

Ms. Derse was kind enough to respond to my e-mail to the Board of Education in which I commented on past published reports that Ms. Derse, while principal at another school, reduced military recuriting presence. My contention was that Ms. Derse had established a pattern of anti-military behavior, to which she responds:
 Mr. Hennessey, however it was reported, the truth of what took place was that if military recruiters were to have remained in the student activity center as they had done, then Mr.</description>

      <description>Police barred Terri Schiavo from receiving the sacrament of communion today. For Easter, I wanted to express some thoughts on the Catholic church&amp;ndash;the community that Judge Greer has isolated Terri from.
 Nine out of ten of what we call new ideas are simply old mistakes. The Catholic Church has for one of her chief duties that of preventing people from making those old mistakes; from making them over and over again forever, as people always do if they are left to themselves.</description>

      <description>FoxNews reports that the Schindlers are filing a final appeal to the Supreme Court.
Developing . . .
 Pinellas Circuit Judge George Greer (search) rejected their argument that Schiavo tried to say &amp;ldquo;I want to live&amp;rdquo; hours before her tube was removed March 18. They argued that she said &amp;ldquo;AHHHHH&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;WAAAAAAA&amp;rdquo; when asked to repeat the phrase.

      <description>Judge George Greer rejected the Schindler&amp;rsquo;s last appeal to save Terri.
From Fox News:
 A state judge on Saturday rejected another attempt by Terri Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s parents to reconnect her feeding tube, rejecting what the couple&amp;rsquo;s lawyer described as their last chance to keep their severely brain-damaged daughter alive.
 The Schindlers said they will not appeal again.
Those who have sacrificed, prayed, e-mailed, blogged, hoped, and cried for Terri may feel defeated.</description>

 Hours after a judge ordered that Terri Schiavo was not to be removed from her hospice, a team of state agents were en route to seize her and have her feeding tube reinserted &amp;ndash; but they stopped short when local police told them they would enforce the judge&amp;rsquo;s order, The Herald has learned.</description>

      <description>At the behest of BlogsForTerri, here&amp;rsquo;s my e-mail to major media outlets informing them that the story of Terri&amp;rsquo;s plea to live is not new&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s been reported for a week.
The media are claiming that the Schindlers&amp;rsquo; lawyer first came up with the story of Terri&amp;rsquo;s words, &amp;ldquo;Aaah&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Waaahn&amp;rdquo; tonight. In fact, that story has been reported for a week. Please make sure your readers, listeners, and viewers understand this is an old story that the MSM ignored.</description>

      <description>(Sorry&amp;ndash; left out the NYC when I originally posted.)
From the &amp;ldquo;you can&amp;rsquo;t this stuff up&amp;rdquo; pile:
 A Bronx teacher who repeatedly flunked his state certification exam paid a formerly homeless man with a developmental disorder $2 to take the test for him, authorities said yesterday.
 But it gets better. What made authorities suspicious was that the homeless guy scored so much higher than the teacher ever scored they knew something was amiss.</description>

      <description>Robert of Hip-Hop Politics shares a sick but touching experience.
 But, when I saw these guys carried away on a strecher and saw his peoples crying, that just stuck. When I got home, I just broke down. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit it. I cried.
 With little girls dying, Terri Schiavo dying, people in Iraq dying, can&amp;rsquo;t we stop killing each other for Easter weekend?</description>

      <description>FoxNews just played audio of the David Gibbs&amp;rsquo;s phone call to Judge Greer in which Gibbs read the affidavit of the woman who soliticited a plea for life from Terri Schiavo on the day her feeding tube was removed.
The affidavit is stunning. There were numerous witnesses who heard Terri say &amp;ldquo;Aaah&amp;rdquo; and then yell &amp;ldquo;Waahn.&amp;rdquo; Among the witnesses was a female police officer.
Why in the name of God are just hearing about this now?</description>

Mrs. Schindler: Governor Bush, you can save our daughter.
Mr. Schindler: This is judicial tyranny. They are determined to kill my daughter. Governor Bush can stop this with the stroke of a pen. They put Terri through a week of hell. I implore him to put a stop to this. This is judicial homocide, and he has to stop he. He kind hide behind a political agenda.</description>

      <description>My daughter died of complications from childhood diabetes more than 10 years ago. At the time, I was warned that diabetes research charities are not very interested in finding a cure. That would put them out of business. Moreover, JDRF seems to prefer people dying to giving up its political bent on stem-cells:

      <description>Perhaps the UN&amp;rsquo;s goal in Sudan is to wait until all of the victims are dead. That would make &amp;ldquo;peace keeping&amp;rdquo; a heck of a lot easier, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it? For that matter, why don&amp;rsquo;t they take a page from the Terri Schiavo story and supply arms and ammo to the team that&amp;rsquo;s winning?
Instead, the UN Security Council, yesterday, took the baby step of approving a peace keeping force for the country.</description>

      <description>I have to agree withEd Morrissey on this: Governor Bush has done all he can do, and he must not violate the law to save Terri Schiavo.
That might sound callous, but staying within the law is now our last refuge. As Thomas More told Will Roper in Robert Bolt&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;A Man for All Seasons&amp;quot;:
 This country&amp;rsquo;s planted thick with laws from coast to coast &amp;ndash; man&amp;rsquo;s laws, not God&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash; and if you cut them down &amp;ndash; and you&amp;rsquo;re just the man to do it &amp;ndash; d&amp;rsquo;you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then?</description>

      <description>Today is the day we celebrate Christ&amp;rsquo;s conviction, scourging, and execution. Celebrate is the correct word. Two thousand years of Hebrew prophecies indicated that the messiah would would be put to death for speaking the truth.
I finally watched Mel Gibson&amp;rsquo;s The Passion of the Christ&amp;rdquo; this week. I had to laugh. It is not a funny movie, but the year&amp;rsquo;s separation from the ignorant blather leading up to its release seems so funny in retrospect.</description>

 SUBJECT: CHANCELLOR&amp;rsquo;S EMAIL TO PREVIOUS WRITERS
 FROM: Office of the Chancellor
SENDER: Collect@Colorado.edu
DATE: March 24, 2005
Dear Friend:
You were one of many citizens who wrote or called the University of Colorado at Boulder concerning the controversial essay about 9/11 written by Professor Ward Churchill. Because of your interest, I am writing to share with you the outcome of our review of allegations concerning Professor Churchill&amp;rsquo;s conduct and scholarship.</description>

Think I&amp;rsquo;m joking? I&amp;rsquo;m not. (See PoliPundit and LGF) If the FEC&amp;rsquo;s proposed rules are adopted, Americans will have to clear their e-mails and blogs with the KGB&amp;ndash;that is, the FEC&amp;ndash;prior to sending.</description>

We have been active indemanding action from the Seattle School Board over a disgusting political ambush of American service members last week.
Upon further review of theletters and e-mails issued by the Seattle School Board and Susan Derse, principal of West Seattle High School, I am determined to garner a more substantive response. Specifically, I expect every adult involved to apologize directly to the ambushed service member and to all members, veterans, and their families.</description>

Also LGF has printed the letters from the Principal, but not the one I received from the school board.

      <description>Judge Greer having denied Governor Jeb Bush&amp;rsquo;s petition to make Terri Schiavo a ward of the state, the Schindlers seem to be out of legal and political options.
Terri&amp;rsquo;s life is in God&amp;rsquo;s hands. In truth, it always has been.
Those who have fought valiently to save Ms. Schiavo must take pride in having fought a good fight. Whatever Michael Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s motives may have been, and whatever the motives of those who took his side, we are best to assume their intentions noble absent evidence to the contrary.</description>

      <description>Winter has been warmer and wetter
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch tried to alarm readers with its headline. Unfortunately, the story didn&amp;rsquo;t fit the bold print.
It turns out that St. Louis had its 17th warmest winter on record. Meteorological winter in St. Louis runs from December 1 through February 28, so the exceptionally cool March won&amp;rsquo;t change the fact. Still, 17th out of 130 does not seem dramatic at all.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago, I blogged about Lee Siegel&amp;rsquo;s anti-religious diatribe in the current The New Republic on-line (registration required). I just re-read his piece, and found something I missed.
I figured Siegel an atheist. He&amp;rsquo;s not. He believes in God, but he&amp;rsquo;s angry at Him. Very angry.
I wonder if a lot of atheists are actually just believers angry that they&amp;rsquo;re not God.
In Luigi Pirandello&amp;rsquo;s Six Characters in Search of an Author, we learn the absurdity of anger at one&amp;rsquo;s creator.</description>

The Corner on National Review Online
   it is worth remembering that the excruciating slowness of the execution here, the incremental-ness of death, is designed by its champions to inure us to it. After the first hour, the second passes with far less fanfare, and the third less still. I&amp;rsquo;ve been following this closely, and I needed to remind myself today how many hours Terri Schiavo has actually been without sustenance by counting the days since Friday afternoon and multiplying by 24.</description>

 The guy on the street is often wrong about general principles of his environment. In other words, when a non-expert pontificates about the weather, the human brain, or the government, he&amp;rsquo;s very likely to come off as Cliff Clavin.
Experts, on the other hand, are usually expert only about general nature of a specific study.</description>

      <description>In Minnesota, a wierd kid who (supposedly) got picked on a lot decided to avenge himself by killing lots of people, including his grandparents.
I think, not so much of the killer, but of the other kids, even the bullies. Yesterday, they had plans. Today, they have wings.
 Hegstrom described the shooter grinning and waving at a student his gun was pointed at, then swiveling to shoot someone else. &amp;ldquo;I looked him in the eye and ran in the room, and that&amp;rsquo;s when I hid,&amp;rdquo; she told The Pioneer.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s not much to say. Judges have determined, in logical order, the following:
A. Michael Schiavo is Terri Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s husband; therefore, B. Michael Schiavo is Terri&amp;rsquo;s legal guardian; therefore, C. Michael Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s desires trump laws of the state and of morality.
Florida law does not permit the execution of a person in Terri Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s condition. The judges (like Glenn Reynolds and James Joyner and others) are too cowardly to come out and say, &amp;ldquo;Look, people, the mentally ill make us kind of sick.</description>

Feel the contempt&amp;ndash;the smug, liberal superiority&amp;ndash;dripping from Siegel&amp;rsquo;s pen as he describes the advanced state of insanity that causes us to have faith in something other than the press, government, and academia: The New Republic Online: Preaching to the Choir

      <description>For the best late news and commentary, see Michelle Malkin&amp;rsquo;s early morning update. Please follow the links. Perhaps you don&amp;rsquo;t want the feds involved because you, like I, support federalism. In this case, a state judge has ordered health care workers to murder an innocent woman. Hiding behind political ideology, in this case, won&amp;rsquo;t keep you from being as complicit in murder as the good Germans living a mile from a death camp who said nothing, did nothing, saw nothing, heard nothing.</description>

      <description>Many people, including many conservative bloggers, believe that justice has been served in Florida. Terri Schiavo should be starved to death as ordered by Judge Greer. (And, please, don&amp;rsquo;t insult my integrity or intelligence by claiming he ordered otherwise. His order prohibits anyone from giving the woman food, water, or any other nutrients. He ordered her starved to death, not denied artificial support.) Well, I think that most of the people who support her murder must be ignorant of what they wish for.</description>

Why?
I am a Microsoft Kool-Aid guzzler. As such, I have tried to keep my blog 100% .Net. I worked through the betas and release candidates for CommunityServer. I really wanted to make it work.
Unfortunately, the current version of .Text is not ready for prime time.</description>

      <description>Outside The Beltway : Bush Returning to Washington Over Schiavo
   So, now, we&amp;rsquo;re going to spend hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to subvert the legal process and the wishes of both Michael and Terri Schiavo in this matter?
 Yesterday, I pointed out that, as individuals, we need to look on the Terri Schiavo ordeal from God&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint. But that&amp;rsquo;s the individual issue. Beyond that, we have to contend with the political/judicial aspects of this case.</description>

      <description>In the battle over Terri Schiavo, I have found but one pertinent argument
OpinionJournal - Peggy Noonan
   There is a passionate, highly motivated and sincere group of voters and activists who care deeply about whether Terri Schiavo is allowed to live. Their reasoning, ultimately, is this: _Be on the side of life. They remind me of what Winston Churchill said once when he became home secretary in charge of England&amp;rsquo;s prisons.</description>

   McGwire was such a disappointment. He showed no guts. If he isnÂt going to take a stand and defend himself against steroids accusations in such a highly publicized and open setting, then I no longer feel compelled to give him the benefit of the doubt on this issue. And Tony La Russa and others who have defended McGwire with such vigor are being made to look like fools.</description>

      <description>CNN.com - Reports: Car bomb explodes in Beirut - Mar 18, 2005
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) &amp;ndash; A car bomb has ripped through a predominantly Christian area of Beirut early Saturday, sheering off part of a multi-story office building and raising concerns about more violence in the volatile Lebanese capital.
 Some people hate peace. Tonight, some of them detonated a car bomb in Beirut. Likely, the goal is to divide Christians from Muslims.</description>

 Authorities said that John Evander Couey (search) admitted that he abducted Jessica from her bedroom more than three weeks ago. He also told them the general area where the young girl&amp;rsquo;s body could be found, according to police.
 What could sound more trite than to say, &amp;ldquo;At least they know?&amp;rdquo; As with Laci Peterson&amp;rsquo;s parents and Ron Goldman&amp;rsquo;s father, it&amp;rsquo;s now up to this sweet little girl&amp;rsquo;s daddy and grandparents whether evil prevails.</description>

      <description>Today before the United States House of Representatives, former major league baseball player and one-time single season home run champion Mark McGwire disgraced himself, his profession, and his career.
Under friendly questioning from William Clay Jr., (D-MO), McGwire repeatedly refused to say if he&amp;rsquo;d ever taken even andro, which he more or less bragged about using when he was a Cardinal.
Clearly, McGwire was a heavy steroid user. I didn&amp;rsquo;t believe so just two weeks ago, but he looked as guilty as OJ today.</description>

      <description>Being Catholic, I&amp;rsquo;m not big on deistic revelations. (Ironic that the parish I grew up in was The Epiphany, huh?) Still, I admit that the story of the Atlanta courthouse shooter has touched me.
Until today, I was more interested in the Wisconsin church shooting.
Then something happened.
About 11:30 I went out to smoke. I walked to my car, where I leave my cigarettes, and turned on the aux to listen to Rush.</description>

   Still, many conservatives are setting aside their dislike of liberal inconsistencies in hopes of allying against potential regulation. &amp;ldquo;Currently, the limits would hurt conservatives more than it would hurt liberals,&amp;rdquo; said conservative blogger Bill Hennessy, noting that more conservative blogs exist. &amp;ldquo;Ultimately, though, the pain is already even; stifling political speech hurts everyone.</description>

      <description>My hockey jones finally crested, today, so I took the boys to a Missouri River Otters game. The Otters play in the UHL. With the NHL lockout in its 438th week, four Blues player&amp;ndash;Bryce Salvador, Jamal Mayers, Ryan Johnson, and former NHL Rookie of the Year Barrett Jackman&amp;ndash;now play for the local minor league team. (Yes, seeing some of my favorite Bluenotes made my decision to see a game easier.) We saw an excellent game, as theOtters defeated the Port Huron Beacons 5-2.</description>

   The man who fatally shot seven people during a quiet church service before turning the gun on himself was on the verge of losing his job and upset over a sermon he heard two weeks ago, investigators said Sunday.
 Let me get this straight: this guyÂs having a tough time personally, then a sermon ticks him off. He gets his gun, goes to church, and kills a bunch of people, then himself.</description>

      <description>Michelle Malkin points to a story of a released terrorist killed by the US Army in Afghanistan. With the EU, the Red Cross, the UN, and the Democrat Party so concerned about the treatment of people who wish to kill and eat their children, maybe we have a win-win opportunity here.
Why not put the detainees on a plane and fly them to Baghdad. Oh, while we&amp;rsquo;re at it, let&amp;rsquo;s implant tracking devices so we know where they are.</description>

      <description>European Union investigators are trying to pin the disappearance of Muslim terrorists on the CIA., according to this story on MSNBC.
What of it? Suppose the CIA is abducting terrorists like Abu Omar and secreting them off to Kuwait or Egypt or Saudi Arabia? So what? Would Italy prefer to harbor these monsters indefinitely?
This is a war against the kinds people who consider mere torture sport. If the abduction and aggressive interrogation of one sicko Muslim radical reveals enough information to thwart a future attack, the practice justifies itself.</description>

      <description>The left dismissed Michael Crichton&amp;rsquo;s book, State of Fear, attributing it to the rants of right-wing extremist. Crichton is actually an environmentalist and liberal, but once one strays off of the liberal plantation, he is no-good runner with rabbit in his blood who must be destroyed.
Dismissing Nicholas Kristof&amp;rsquo;s NYT Op-Ed column on the subject, though, may prove troublesome for tree huggers. Kristof&amp;rsquo;s environmentalist credentials are even more solid than Crichton&amp;rsquo;s, and his life includes the kind of humanitarian missions leftists talk about but rarely perform.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a thread worth reading.
Blind Mind&amp;rsquo;s Eye: A challenge to social conservatives who are upset by the Supreme Court ruling on executing minors
   As a more moderate libertarian, I have no particular problem with the death penalty, but do find in many ways the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s ruling to be consistent with how many want to view teenagers in this society.
 Mike makes some interesting assumptions about social conservatives&amp;rsquo; views of teens.</description>

      <description>In 1992, I started a little company to produce and sell political t-shirts, sweatshirts, and bumperstickers. It remained at break even too long, so I folded. (Some of you might have our best-seller: I Got Wet When Clinton Soaked the Rich.) I never bought anyone else&amp;rsquo;s stuff because I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought my ideas were better.

One of the topics of the day was Generation X. People like Rush Limbaugh and others got a kick out of making fun of Xers. They were slackers who wanted to make $45.00 an hour flipping burgers. Or, better, they wanted to graduate from college and step into an eighty grand a year job with a company car.</description>

Captain Ed sums up McCain&amp;rsquo;s chicanery quite well:
   Here we have a man who has done more harm to the First Amendment as anyone in the past generation, all the while scolding us on coordination of electoral efforts, and he&amp;rsquo;s playing a shell game with Cablevision in order to gin up indirect payments to his staff.</description>

Senator John McCain, the Keating Five escapee who put his name on a bill intended to destroy the First Amendment, has been caught with his hand in the till.
According to theAssociated Press, one of the few organizations that stands to gain politically under McCain-Feingold, the Senator and former POW pressed for pricing changes on behalf of Cablevision while soliciting $200,000 from Cablevision for one of McCain&amp;rsquo;s tax-exempt political action committees, The Reform Institute.</description>

      <description>This week, the blogosphere buzzed with reaction to Senator Robert &amp;ldquo;Grand Wizard&amp;rdquo; Byrd&amp;rsquo;s comparison of the Republican Senate leaders to Nazis. His Washington Post op-ed contains some of the most partisan and hate-inspiring language penned by a sitting Senator in modern times.
Some of the shock over Byrd&amp;rsquo;s incendiary comments may arise from the carefully managed but false image of Byrd. The mainstream press, liberal academicians, and historians have, for decades, portrayed Byrd as a kindly, intellectual defender of the Senate&amp;rsquo;s history.</description>

In the best acting, the more &amp;ldquo;make believe&amp;rdquo; the presentation, the more real. A great play demands that you strip the stage of technology and present truth in angry, cold, black and white, two-dimensional reality. Truth shines through, unencumbered by sets and lights.</description>

      <description>A couple weeks ago, I asked CU&amp;rsquo;s board of regents to explain how Mr. Churchill received tenure and a chair despite numerous warnings about his credentials and behavior. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect a response, but I got one, and quite a long one Here it is:
   SUBJECT: Response Concerning Professor Churchill

      <description>Former Clinton White House aide Nancy Soderberg admitted on The Daily Show that she and other Democrats want Bush&amp;rsquo;s war against terrorism to fail.
NewsMax.com: Inside Cover Story
_After noting that the U.S.&amp;lsquo;s stunning foreign policy success followed the toppling of one of the three members of the axis of evil, Soderberg suggested again that the more success America has in defeating global terrorism, the worse it is for her party.</description>

      <title>Big Unions = Liberal Activism</title>

      <description>The union workers I grew up around weren&amp;rsquo;t liberals by any stretch. They were Archie Bunker (and I mean that in a good way). Since the early 1980s, though, their unions have abandoned putting workers first in favor of putting leftwing ideology first. The result has been a massive exodus from the union shops into non-union companies.
But the unions have also done a disservice to the entire middle class. By concentrating on politics instead of labor issues, the AFL-CIO and other big unions have favored policies that destroy middle class jobs.</description>

      <description>For $3.5 billion, it could be yours.
The Wall Street Journal reports that he NHL is considering selling itself to a group in Boston:
   The audacious move to buy the NHL is the first of its kind involving a major U.S. sports league. If successful, a sale would convert the NHL from a collection of 30 individual franchises to what&amp;rsquo;s known in the sports industry as a single entity.</description>

      <description>According to Saddam Hussein&amp;rsquo;s personal MSM reporter, Peter Arnett, Uday Hussein was only days away from toppling his father when the US invaded the country.
Given Uday&amp;rsquo;s history of masochism, murder, rape, and mayhem, the Iraqi people are damn lucky the US showed up when it did. Here&amp;rsquo;s Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s brief rundown of some of Uday&amp;rsquo;s more famous attrocities against humanity:
 As head of the Iraqi Olympic Committee, Uday oversaw the imprisonment and torture of Iraqi athletes who were deemed not to have performed to expectations.</description>

      <description>Michelle on Right in Texas wonders why some want to ban cities from providing free internet access in Texas. Could it be McCain-Feingold?
UPDATE: Looks like I was way, way off base with this explanation. According to theHouston Chronicle, the Texas legislator sponsoring the bill is Republican Phil King. King&amp;rsquo;s says that when municipalities provide free internet access they screw up the free market.
   King&amp;rsquo;s basic objection, Trainor said, stands Â in a free-market system it&amp;rsquo;s not acceptable to let public government compete with private businesses</description>

      <description>_Today the consequences of your un-American and anti-Constitutional Campaign Finance Reform bill reached their totalitarian zenith as the FEC made clear that the people no longer have the right to voice their political beliefs on web logs. _
Since 2000, Senator, you have worked overtime at binding the spirit and body of the American people. You deny us, the people, free speech. You deny us, the people, free movement. You deny us, the people, the freedom other men died to give you in Vietnam.</description>

      <description>Way too much to catalog here, but one big thing is&amp;ndash;dying.
According to the World Tribune, atheism is in decline around the world.
   John Updike&amp;rsquo;s observation, &amp;ldquo;Among the repulsions of atheism for me has been is drastic uninterestingness as an intellectual position,&amp;rdquo; appears to become common currency throughout much of the West. The Rev. Paul M. Zulehner, dean of Vienna University&amp;rsquo;s divinity school and one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most distinguished sociologists of religion, told UPI Tuesday: &amp;ldquo;True atheists in Europe have become an infinitesimally small group.</description>

I am so moved by Senator Byrd&amp;rsquo;s undying respect for the Senate&amp;rsquo;s traditions that I must ask him to go further to make his point. If he wants the American people to really understand how serious a threat to democracy is the invokation of cloture, he should demand time to speak, kneel down in the middle of the aisle, and set himself ablaze with gasoline.</description>

He sees a permanent, structural shift word democracy in the Middle East. &amp;ldquo;So, say the despots, this wave of rising expectations about freedom and democracy will pass. TheyÂve seen it all before,&amp;rdquo; writes Dickey. But this time, he senses something different.
        Well, not this time. The whole political environment has changed in the Middle East.</description>

      <description>So, theSupremes peered into the US Constitution and found an entry regarding the age of criminal defendants and what punishments states may imposed thereon. I wish they would release the version of the Constitution which they read so we citizens, subject to the document as we are, may read it. Clearly, the one published in text books isn&amp;rsquo;t the one given the Supreme Court. Either that, or it reads differently under the magnification of their crystal ball.</description>

      <description>Okay, I know I&amp;rsquo;m not a genius like the mad doctor from Vermont, but could someone explain the logic of Dean&amp;rsquo;s latest idiotic blusterfest?
On the one hand, he extolls (kind of) the virtues of &amp;ldquo;tolerance&amp;rdquo;:
          &amp;ldquo;Moderate Republicans can&amp;rsquo;t stand these people (conservatives), because they&amp;rsquo;re intolerant. They don&amp;rsquo;t think tolerance is a virtue,&amp;rdquo; Dean said, adding: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to have these right-wingers throw away our right to be tolerant.</description>

      <description>Well, we know that the left opposes the death penalty for the likes of Dennis Rader, the BTK killer, but some do support capital punishment for political speech and activity. Stephen Crockett wants murder Katherine Harris and Ken Blackwell because they&amp;rsquo;re Republicans. Combine this with the DUer who wants to beat the crap out of the 9-year-old for Social Security reform, and you have the makings of a leftwing lynch mob.</description>

      <description>The disturbing case of Ward Churchill has me asking a question I ought not ask, but somehow feel compelled. The NCAA has an arcane, complicated, often brainless set of rules regarding recruitment and pampering of college athletes. The rules require major universities to hire folks just to deal with compliance. I hate bureaucracies like that.
But the system effectively reduces the ability of a college to buy great sports teams. Moreover, the system demands that members require minimum (though way too minimal) education standards for student athletes.</description>

        1. exploiting children&amp;hellip;yup, that&amp;rsquo;s family values, alright&amp;hellip;.
    Why, pray tell is the mother allowing this? It is one thing to encourage your child to read and develop their own opinions, but to allow others to exploit those earliest opinions of childhood (which most of us may recall, DO change over time)&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>The BTK killer&amp;rsquo;s name is Dennis Rader. He is the poison that grows on the bottom of a cesspool. He is the stuff that Hell considers too vile to abide. He is sin incarnate.
A brave, good neighbor of his called him out two days after another neighbor died. She was a good woman dying of cancer with a little dog. She would let the dog out to go potty, and Dennis Rader, Animal Control Officer, would give her a citation.</description>

Bill Clinton made a political career of putting off everything that could be put off. Call it leadership by procrastination. He succeeded because thatÂs the way people are. We put things off. Even the most anal, scheduled, organized worry-wart puts things off, particularly things he feels he can do nothing about.</description>

      <description>is a day without rain.
Steven Taylor beat me to this story that the people who provided Churchill a podium from which to spew hatred, terrorism, venom, and lies is considering buying out his contract, as they would with a failing football coach. (But one whose players like to rape girls.) Read the rest on Poliblog.

      <description>About a year ago, I fired off a letter writing campaign to Missouri legistors urging them to fight a movement, sponsored by then-governor Bob Holden, to require Chick Pox vaccines for all Missouri children entering school. Michelle Malkin points out that Ohio has passed such a law with a link to the chicken pox vaccine money trail. (There&amp;rsquo;s always a money trail.)
Mandatory chicken pox vaccines will kill people. According to Dr.</description>

      <description>Michelle Malkin has dug up some artwork claimed to be the original work of Terrorist Advocate Ward Churchill. But, clearly, the works are not original, unless Mr. Churchill channels 19th century western artists and photographers.
To those who say Churchill speaks for the American Indian better than anyone else, I say that his words that have so enchanted you most likely were plagiarized.
Since Churchill&amp;rsquo;s rabid defenders will not expend the energy to click Michelle&amp;rsquo;s link, here&amp;rsquo;s the pertinent part of a CBS4 in Denver story Michelle reprinted in whole:</description>

Basically, Corn says what we already know: Howard Dean is his own worst enemy, and, as DNC chairman, is turning into his party&amp;rsquo;s worst enemy. Specifially, Corn responds to Dean&amp;rsquo;s recent announcement that people are afraid to call themselves Democrats because &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not socially acceptable to be a Democrat.</description>

      <description>The Chris Rock quote that got so many conservatives so up in arms about abortion appears to be more pro-life than pro-choice, according to John Swansburg writing on Slate.
The controversy involves this line from Rock: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s beautiful that abortion is legal&amp;rdquo; and says that he likes to pick up women at abortion rallies. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Cause you know they&amp;rsquo;re [expletive].&amp;rdquo;
But that isolated sentiment is part of a larger theme in Rock&amp;rsquo;s routine, and, in reasonable context, constitutes a slap at the frivolity of &amp;ldquo;choice.</description>

Do we really care?&amp;rdquo; he said, quoting those he called his &amp;ldquo;white Republican&amp;rdquo; critics.     &amp;quot;Let&amp;rsquo;s cut to the chase; I am not,&amp;rdquo; he said.     His pedigree is &amp;ldquo;not important,&amp;rdquo; Churchill said: &amp;ldquo;The issue is the substance of what is said.</description>

      <description>Dean Esmay hooked us up tothis fine column. As I commented on Dean&amp;rsquo;s blog, it reminds me of reading James Burnham&amp;rsquo;s masterpiece, Suicide of the West, in 1980. In the prologue, Burnham writes about looking over political maps of the world from ancient Egypt to the 20th century. He paints stark images of the West&amp;rsquo;s advances, eventually engulfing more than half the world. (Please don&amp;rsquo;t lecture me on the math.)</description>

While I&amp;rsquo;m not quite ready to jump on the Condi 08 bandwagon just yet, this is a very encouraging story for those who have. For obvious reasons, I think it most likely that our first female president and our first black president will come from the party viewed as the more conservative.

      <description>Steven Taylor rightly predicts that today&amp;rsquo;s top story will be the Washington Post report that the White House redacted the whole of the report on Iraq&amp;rsquo;s economy from last week&amp;rsquo;s economic report.
The story claims that the good news about Iraq&amp;rsquo;s economy would be inappropriate at a time when so many security problems exist. That rings hollow. The President could use some good news in his European trip, and the whole world could use some good news about Iraq.</description>

   Iraq under Saddam supported international terrorist organizations to bolster Iraq&amp;rsquo;s revolutionary credentials, ensure his own role as Great Arab leader, and intimidate rival governments. In examining the history, methods, and patterns of behavior of Saddam Husayn in supporting international terrorism, some &amp;ldquo;truths&amp;rdquo; stand out.</description>

Hiring Kerry hacks demonstrates the UN&amp;rsquo;s tone-deafness to American politics. I&amp;rsquo;m still waiting for some ex-official to open the books on the Kofi Annan and his family money laundry.

   The Rocky Mountain News today claims that Mr. Ward Churchill received tenure as a result of Colorado University&amp;rsquo;s failure to explore an alleged offer of tenure from the University of California system.
  I am interested in knowing whether or not Mr. Churchill implied such offer was made, or if someone at Colorado merely assumed such.</description>

Taylor also noted that UofC waived some normal requirements in the process, namely demanding a PhD. Now we know that the left&amp;rsquo;s favorite nut case obtained both tenure and chair of Ethnic Studies at University of Colorado by lying. He convinced UofC that the University of California system had offered him professorship in American Indian studies, causing Colorado to rush his tenure through.</description>

The aim was to define a strategy to get the US out of Iraq before it turns into a success. Among the &amp;ldquo;luminaries&amp;rdquo; present: Danny Glover and Tom Hayden.
Fortunately for the causes of freedom, liberty, justice, and common sense, the assembled lefties spend so much time decrying the vote count in Ohio and Michael Crichton&amp;rsquo;s book, they ran out of time to produce a strategy.</description>

In his first European trip since re-election, President Bush displays remarkable statemanship.
Balancing between firmness and friendliness, the President places American interest first, yet he undeniably wins friends on every stop.
Sometimes, timing is everything, and the President dares to admit such:
_&amp;ldquo;This is the first dinner since I&amp;rsquo;ve been re-elected on European soil, and it&amp;rsquo;s with Jacques Chirac. And that ought to say something.</description>

      <description>ItÂs about time. Joe Gandelman points out that the people who brought you the Swift Vets are taking aim on the AARPÂa corrupt, leftist organization committed to stealing from the young and giving to the old whilst limiting freedom for everyone and outlawing cell phones.
I despise the AARP and everything it stands for, particularly its blogroll. (Find it yourselfÂIÂm not providing a link to the wealthy old bastards.)

      <description>A Little More To The Right: Humor AND Opinion
https://www.alittlemoretotheright.com/journal/00002143.html
Anti-War lefties hang American Soldier in effigy. Good job, folks. That convinced me: IÂm wrong. LetÂs pull all of the troops out of Afghanistan and Iraq. South Korea, too. Life was so much better for those people without us. Except for the South Koreans, who would be so much better off with Kim Jong ILL as their slavemaster.

      <description>The American Thinker
   I am as pleased as anyone with Condoleezza RiceÂs initial performance as Secretary of State. SheÂs a smart, articulate, passionate defender of America and George W. BushÂs foreign policy vision. But all the excited talk about ÂCondi for PresidentÂ is wildly premature, and even dangerous to the conservative cause.
 writes Steven M. Warshawsky on The American Thinker, February 15. Mr. Warshawsky goes on to list some pretty predictable problems with Condoleezza RiceÂs White House credentials:</description>

      <description>My Way News
Usually, these stories garner only a &amp;ldquo;whatever&amp;rdquo; from me. Not sure why this one has me thinking about my kids and parents and wife. It does. Avian flu outbreaks in Vietnam bird populations threaten to spread across the world. This could be the worst pandemic since 1918. Worse than that even, since 72% of those diagnosed with this nasty virus &amp;ndash; die.
 The H5N1 avian flu, which first appeared in Hong Kong in 1997 and has since popped up twice, is evolving and can jump directly from birds to people, killing an estimated 72 percent of diagnosed victims, Gerberding said.</description>

      <description>You might have caught myrunning, er, conversation  (expand comments) with someone calling himself SoupMan. After a few shots at him (some unfair, I admit), he disclosed the link to his blog, Hip-Hop Politics. I took a look around. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t surprised by anything. Obviously, I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with anything, but nothing was shocking.
Mr. SoupMan was reluctant to share his link with me. He didn&amp;rsquo;t want hassles he&amp;rsquo;d experienced before.</description>

      <description>Windows is more secure than Linux for operating a web site, so concludes an independent study. And in more than ten years of helping companies embrace the internet and new technology, I can assure you that a front-to-back Microsoft solution is the least expensive possible. Sun hardware/Oracle DB is the most expensive and has the longest time to market. Linux lands in the middle of everything.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;We were somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of the dessert, when the drugs began to take hold.&amp;rdquo;
 That&amp;rsquo;s how begins the book that drove me to misspend a significant portion of my youth. I first read Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas in 1982 after graduating from high school. If marijuana is a gateway drug, it&amp;rsquo;s literary equivalent is Catcher in the Rye. Fear and Loathing is literary adrenichrome.</description>

      <description>Movies that mimic documentaries often fall short in both emotional impact and believability. The September Tapes, by First Look Pictures, breaks that trend.
A man lost his young wife on Sepember 11, 2001, a passenger on one of the planes. In desparation and dissatisfied with the US military&amp;rsquo;s progress in finding and killing bin Laden, Don Larson sells all of his worldly possessions to finance a trip to Afghanistan to get answers on the hunt for bin Laden from the ground.</description>

Yesterday,I blogged on a New York Times story that Lubbers would not resign, calling the numerous sexual harassment changes against him &amp;ldquo;lies.&amp;rdquo; That story also reported that Kofi Annan planned to seek legal advice on the matter over the weekend. Apparently, Lubbers felt the heat.
It looks like the UN&amp;rsquo;s closet door is open, and the skeletons are shaking out.</description>

      <description>Steven Taylor wonders how long it will take the left to claim the Wead tapes were manufactured by Karl Rove.
The answer: Not Long.
I strolled the DemocraticUnderground forum today. (Strolled? No. Jogged. Churchill said, &amp;ldquo;when you&amp;rsquo;re going through hell, keep going.&amp;quot;) Here&amp;rsquo;s what I found:
From OETKB:
        Given the author and its less than revealing information and a veiled attempt to portray this dangerous man(*) as &amp;ldquo;one of us,&amp;rdquo; this is one of those stories that has probably emenated from the bowels of the Heritage Foundation with the heavy guidance of Karl Rove.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, St. Louis had two major dailies: the St. Louis Globe-Democrat and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The Globe was the conservative newspaper. It&amp;rsquo;s where Pat Buchanan got his start. The Post was the liberal paper. Then the Globe folded, leaving St. Louis with only the lefty paper.
Since then, the quality of the Post has dropped precipitously. It is now a very bad paper with lousy writing, absent-minded editing, and incomplete coverage.</description>

      <description>The New York Times print edition has a delightful story about the new friendship between George Bush 41 and Bill Clinton.
Some of was pretty harsh on Clinton during his presidency, and IÂm certainly in that group. But a friendship between the presidentÂs father and predecessor is good for everyone.
George H. W. Bush, a terrible politician and so-so leader, is a wonderful human being. Bill Clinton is a man of no real political convictions, endless charm, and endearing wit.</description>

      <description>From the AP:
   &amp;ldquo;In view of the special conditions faced by Syria, Iran will transfer its experience, especially concerning sanctions, to Syria,&amp;rdquo; Mohammad Reza Aref, Iran&amp;rsquo;s first vice president, was quoted as saying after meeting Syrian Prime Minister Mohammad Naji Otari.
 How surprising. Iraq&amp;rsquo;s neighbors joining forces to oppose the US, though they don&amp;rsquo;t mention us by name. It makes me wonder what their relationhip has been up until now.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve had my disagreements with Senator Specter, but so has the left. Feminists still seeth over his valient defense of Clarence Thomas.

      <description>Provided by the Heritage Foundation. (Gotta have something for the Beltway Traffic Jam)
 The current Social Security system is a very poor investment. A 25-year-old man is predicted to receive a Â0.82 percent rate of return on his Social Security taxes.2 Low-income workers have extremely poor rates of return, and many low-income men will receive less in benefits than they paid in Social Security payroll taxes. A 25-year-old man living in Harlem would have a Â4.</description>

 Good heavens. Is it really that big of a deal, Michael? Leave it alone. Don&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;under God&amp;rdquo; when reciting the pledge. Instruct your children not to say it. But some of us growing weary of hearing what offends you.</description>

      <description>Le Moyne College has expelled a grad student for writing a paper (which recieved a grade of A) that advocates stricter discipline in schools. According to the dismissal letter, Le Moyne beleives that all students must strictly adhere to the administration&amp;rsquo;s philosophy of education. There is no room at Le Moyne for individual thinking, according to Cathy Leogrande, who signed the letter:
   Leogrande wrote, ÂI have grave concerns regarding the mismatch between your personal beliefs regarding teaching and learning and the Le Moyne College program goals.</description>

      <description>A week or so ago, I warned that the MSM would launch a fierce counterattack against blogs in the face of Eason Jordan&amp;rsquo;s resignation. Michelle Malkin posted this story today about a blogger in Oklahoma who has been treatened by a Tulsa newspaper.
My guess is that The Tulsa World&amp;lsquo;s tactic of denying bloggers the privilege of linking to stories will become widespread. Unfortunately for the MSM, there are Fair Use principles in the United States that permit bloggers and anyone else to use copyright material without explicit permission.</description>

      <description>Some staggering statistics release yesterday show that, dollar for dollar, Google may be the most pro-Democrat company in the United States.
   Google employees gave $207,650 to federal candidates for last year&amp;rsquo;s elections, up from just $250 in 2000 when it was still a start-up. And 98% went to Democrats, the biggest share among top tech donors, a new USA TODAY campaign finance analysis shows.

But wait . . . liberals don&amp;rsquo;t lose in courts in Europe. So the wackjobs&amp;ndash;Helen Steel and David Morris&amp;ndash;appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in, where else, France.

      <description>John Kerry tried to make a campaign issue out of the flu vaccine shortage. It didn&amp;rsquo;t work, but he tried. So did other senior Democrats.
Today we learn that flu shots may not prolong lives among the elderly.
   Led by National Institutes of Health researchers, the study challenges standard government dogma and is bound to confuse senior citizens. During last fall&amp;rsquo;s flu vaccine shortage, thousands of older Americans, heeding the government&amp;rsquo;s public health message, stood in long lines to get their shots.</description>

Some stories hit me harder than others, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been anti-UN for about 20 years. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post a few lines that wrote in my 1993 book, The Conservative Manifesto:
   Since there is little evidence to defend the United Nations as anything but a hindrance to the cause of democracy and the advance of American foreign policy, we will withdraw from the United Nations and expel it from our borders.</description>

The district covers far west St. Louis County, Missouri, and touts itself as one of the best school districts in the nation. Based on standardized scores, they have every right.
But Rockwood has some problems, too, and some of those problems have or will become societal problems.
Rockwood, it seems, prefers dealing with the highly intelligent, well-behaved children of very rich Wildwood folks.</description>

      <description>Want to know how Howard Dean thinks?
   I support allotting a certain percentage of seats in these elections for the Sunnis.
 Ponder that a moment.
The man who wanted to be chief executive of the modern world&amp;rsquo;s first democratic republic wrote on January 10, 2005, that he believes Iraqis deserve some sort of managed democracy in which votes are only marginally important.
Instead of letting the people, who can&amp;rsquo;t be trusted in Dean&amp;rsquo;s view, to decide affairs, Dean would have a team of fairness experts decide how to apportion seats in the Iraqi legislature.</description>

      <description>Over at Left2Right, Don Herzog claims that conservatives worship at the alter of &amp;ldquo;strict construction&amp;rdquo; of Constitutional matters.
   Strict construction means applying the language of the Constitution to what it straightforwardly refers to, not Â here&amp;rsquo;s the connection Â using it as a springboard to make stuff up.
 You&amp;rsquo;re wrong from the get-go, Don. Conservatives don&amp;rsquo;t honor strict constructionalism. We insist on original understanding.
Put simply, the framers of laws have one chance to get their meaning across in writing.</description>

Well, little girl who was too shy to pen her name, if you sawABC&amp;rsquo;s 20/20 tonight, you learned a little about that wonderful institution.</description>

      <description>I missed the Eason Jordan affair.
I heard about it, followed the stories, and read the blogs. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like commenting here. The reason was that the story was obvious. Senior executives in the mainstream media believe that conservatives are Bible-beating idiots, Republicans raped poor black women so they can later eat the off-spring, and soldiers are murderers who enlist so they can kill without repercusion. Sorry, folks, but that&amp;rsquo;s how MSM, most college professors, a good major of the population of New York City, and Eason Jordan view us.</description>

His writing is as enjoyable as his conversation&amp;ndash;and it&amp;rsquo;s conversation he has on talk shows, not interviews.

      <description>In an interview with USA Today, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the once and future president of Iran, said the US and Iran have more common ground than differences. Running for a return to the Iranian presidency, Rafsanjani was clearly speaking to the White House through the press.
If he&amp;rsquo;s sincere and he returns to power, this could be a major victory for Bush&amp;rsquo;s foreign policy in the Middle East. Bringing a moderate or liberal government to Iran is not Rafsanjani&amp;rsquo;s goal, for sure, but, like Gorbechev found in the Soviet Union, any reform could spin out of control.</description>

Woohoo!!!!!

      <description>Boy, something evil crawled up the wrong end of The Simpsons&amp;rsquo; writers and died. You get the feeling that they&amp;rsquo;re pulling for Al Qaeda. The entire post game episode, promoted heavily for two weeks, was a mockery of everything good and decent. Anyone with mild religiosity advocates beating and killing.
Ah, well. They lost the biggest election of their putrid lives. I guess I should remember them in my prayers tonight.</description>

      <description>If there&amp;rsquo;s anyone on this planet whose presence depresses the hell out of me, it&amp;rsquo;s that brainless windbag Janeane Garofalo. Not that I needed more reasons to despise her, but A Little More to the Right found one. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen this anywhere else, so take a read. Money quote:
   &amp;ldquo;The inked fingers and the position of them, which is gonna be a &amp;lsquo;Daily Show&amp;rsquo; photo already, of them signaling in this manner [Nazi salute], as if they have solidarity with the Iraqis who braved physical threats against their lives to vote as if somehow these inked-fingered Republicans have something to do with that.</description>

      <description>of the DNC Chair.
   (CNN) &amp;ndash; Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean appears to have virtually locked up the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, after his last major challenger dropped out of the race and endorsed him Friday night.
  Veteran party activist Donnie Fowler, who had been positioning himself as the alternative candidate to Dean, said it was &amp;ldquo;clear&amp;rdquo; Dean had the votes to become the new chairman when DNC members vote next week.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not objective because of my soft spot for the military, in part because I served in the Navy for 10 years, and in part because all of my male relatives in my parents&amp;rsquo; generation fought in World War II, Korea, or both.</description>

   The Manhattan district attorney has launched a criminal probe into Benon Sevan , the U.N. Oil-for-Food chief who investigators said had &amp;ldquo;serious conflict of interest&amp;rdquo; while overseeing the program.
 I must say this is good news. An indictment by a US grand jury is one of only two ways to get to the bottom of the scam, and the only hope for putting the criminals behind bars.</description>

      <description>Washington, DC&amp;ndash;Degraded by 18 months of America&amp;rsquo;s continued war on terror, and many of its most senior leaders killed or captured, Usama bin Laden&amp;rsquo;s international terrorists group al Qaeda has resorted to new tactics in its relentless attempt to collapse Western Civilization.
According to administration sources speaking on condition of anonymity, the new tactics include ordering expensive pizzas for delivery to senior Bush administration officials&amp;rsquo; homes, making crank phone calls to American military high command at all hours of the night, and sending spam e-mails to American troops promising millions of dollars working from home&amp;ndash;all attempts to degrade morale.</description>

   You can expect to pay $383,219 in Social Security taxes over your working life for retirement and survivors benefits. For those taxes, you can expect to receive $2,525 a month in Social Security retirement benefits. Your rate of return under today&amp;rsquo;s Social Security is 0.</description>

      <description>Looks like Paul Volcker&amp;rsquo;s investigation of the UN Oil-for-Terrorism scam is closing in on Kofi Annan.
   Investigators probing alleged corruption at the United Nations oil-for-food program are scrutinizing thousands of pages of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan&amp;rsquo;s documents, including e-mail and phone records, to determine whether he exerted influence in securing a contract for a Swiss company that employed his son.
 Previously, Volcker&amp;rsquo;s team had cleared the elder Annan of wrong-doing in connection with the scam which diverted billlions of dollars intended to releive the suffering of poor Iraqis into the pockets of Saddam Hussein and his sons.</description>

UPDATE: Vote in the Ward Churchill Poll
Joe Gandelman, blogging on Dean&amp;rsquo;s World, has an observation about the recalcitrant and intellectually bereft Ward Churchill.
   All kinds of books came out post-911 that clearly laid out the fact that terrorists seek high body counts. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the bodies are you, your wife, your newborn kid, your grandmother, Jews, Christians, atheists or Muslims who are unlucky enough to be in the target area.</description>

      <description>Two years ago this coming Tuesday, I met a girl for a drink at the Fox and Hounds at Cheshire Inn in St. Louis. She&amp;rsquo;d contacted me through Match.com about two weeks earlier. I watched her cross Clayton Road. She moved like a dream&amp;ndash;beautiful, graceful, certain. We talked for over 3 hours. I sang all the way home&amp;ndash;40 minutes. I sang Sinatra and Lenny Kravitz.
We went out on Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, one week later.</description>

        &amp;ldquo;I think what we&amp;rsquo;re hearing from Europe is a desire to move on to the next chapter in this great alliance,&amp;rdquo; Rice said after meeting with Poland&amp;rsquo;s foreign minister, Adam Rotfeld.
  Of course. While Poland was on our side,Rice was likely referring to the French and Germans&amp;ndash;and possibly the wimpering new Spanish government.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: Steven Taylor favors us with an extensive examination of the Churchill debate with links to pertinent blogs and articles. I understand his points about the protections Churchill has built up over time: tenure, government employee, etc. As an originalist, I don&amp;rsquo;t buy the government employee protection because I don&amp;rsquo;t buy the conduit of the 14th Amendment argument. Further, firing him is not the same as incarcerating him. The state of Colorado is under no Constitutional or moral obligation to continue the employment of any person it deems detrimental to the state&amp;rsquo;s welfare.</description>

      <description>Before I ever heard the term blogging, I published three 500-750 word columns a week on my old website. That started in 1999. Work and other things became too demanding, so I let it lapse in 2001. This blog began about two years ago, but I got serious on December 15, 2003. I&amp;rsquo;ll mark that as my anniversary. It was the Monday after Saddam fell (crawled) into US custody.

I didn&amp;rsquo;t think he&amp;rsquo;d run, then I didn&amp;rsquo;t think he&amp;rsquo;d win, then I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how well he&amp;rsquo;d do. But I have to admit, this guy seems to have been born to run the state of California. He&amp;rsquo;s been on top of the polls for over a year now&amp;ndash;probably the most popular governor of any state in the country over that period.</description>

      <description>Besides instantly becoming the most despised college professor in America&amp;ndash;not an easy thing to achieve, by the way&amp;ndash;Ward Churchill recieved two doses of bad news today:
First, though he claims 1/16 Cherokee, the tribe he claims to belong to says &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rsquo;s not one of us.&amp;rdquo; His name is nowhere in their database, so he&amp;rsquo;s not a member.
Next, the University of Colorado might fire him.

 First, Condi and Gonzalez have been confirmed. The stock market continues to improve. The State of the Union address was the best he&amp;rsquo;s given so far. The Iraqi elections were an overwhelming success.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s keep this brainless, hate-spreading, son-of-a-bitch around awhile. I like kicking stupid bastards around, and Ward Churchill is my top candidate for Stupid Bastard of the 21st Century.

While many Republicans canÂt wait for Dr. Dean to take his seat at the head of the opposition table, I am a little cautious.</description>

      <description>Yes, folks, the end is obviously near for the terrorists in Iraq as evidenced bythis story of a video on a web site that frequently shows hostage tapes. Close inspection . . . what am I saying? . . . a casual glance reveals that the subject of photo is a GI Joe doll or some knock-off. The gun is obviously plastic.

Well, they didn&amp;rsquo;t claim that, exactly, but if the BBC can irresponsibly hyperbolize facts in order to promoted its twisted, anti-Western, pro-terrorist viewpoints, why can&amp;rsquo;t we?

      <description>Terrorists used a disabled child as a suicide bomber on election day, Iraqi interior minister Falah al-Naqib said today.
    In all, 44 people were killed in a total of 38 bomb attacks on polling stations. Police at the scene of one the Baghdad blasts said the bomber appeared to have Down&amp;rsquo;s syndrome.
    Mr Al-Naqib praised an Iraqi citizen who was killed while preventing one suicide bomber from reaching a crowd of people outside a polling station.</description>

      <description>I removed a blog from my roll. The blog posts excellent material, but they have some sort of daemon running that constantly reports that their site has been updated when, in fact, it has not. Good marketing to keep your name at the top of the Recently Updated lists, but, in my opinion, poor sportsmanship.   </description>

      <description>The headline of Iraq&amp;rsquo;s first free elections. Better than expected. Less violence than feared. Higher turnout than anticipated&amp;ndash;over 60% nationwide.
Ah, lovers of freedom and self-determination, savor the moment. When the statues of Saddam fell, the world laughed. But when the people voted today, the gods smiled. This, like our own election in 1788, the election today is the first true exercise of freedom in Iraq.
Sure, John Kerry can only decry the lack of &amp;ldquo;international community&amp;rdquo; participation.</description>

Dean stopped reading too soon. Here is the entire list of NYT&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo; coverage of Iraq. Complete my Irish-white rear-end. Negative stories are in bold. (12 of 17)

      <description>I just saw the tape of Condoleezza Rice&amp;rsquo;s swearing-in as Secretary of State. Behind her stood her mother and father.
Rice came into the world during segregation in a segregated Alabama. Unlike Madelaine Albright, who discovered she was Jewish when a Jew in the cabinet migh help her president, Secretary Rice has known her life that she&amp;rsquo;s black. In Alabama as a girl, society didn&amp;rsquo;t let you forget.
Ms. Rice follows another African-American in the highest cabinet post of the most powerful country in the world.</description>

      <description>MyDD blog has a very good analysis of his party&amp;rsquo;s relationship to labor vis a vis other liberal causes. I like to think of labor unions as applied liberalism, and academic liberalism (causes) as theoretical or pure liberalism. Having grown up in very pro-labor neighborhood of South St. Louis, I have soft spot for guys like this.

      <description>I watched TVLand&amp;rsquo;s tribute to Johnny Carson tonight. Following that was an old episode of All in the Family. Archie wanted to watch football highlights, but Meathead wanted to watch a special with Jack Lemon about polution. Then Little Girl came home from the grocery store with organic food&amp;ndash;depriving Archie of his crunchy cereal with the animal cutouts on the box. The conversation moved to argument about a) the environment, b) race relations, c) drinking water, d) the war in Vietnam.</description>

      <description>Senator Mark Dayton, a Democrat from Minnesota, called Condoleezza Rice and President George Bush liars on the Senate floor today.
While Senators have used the word liar occasionally, those occasions have been rare. At one time, the word demanded censure or a duel. These days, coming from members of Bill Clinton&amp;rsquo;s party, one must assume &amp;ldquo;liar&amp;rdquo; is some sort of underhanded praise.
Condoleezza Rice&amp;rsquo;s confirmation is already in the books. She will receive more than 2/3 of the Senate&amp;rsquo;s endorsement.</description>

Johnny Carson was a giant of Americana from the 1960s through 1992. He dominated the late night airwaves in a way no one else ever will.</description>

Armstrong says his brother is a good conservative who could not hope to win running as a Republican in that district. Good for Kent and for the people of his district. Party affiliation isn&amp;rsquo;t as important as core beliefs, and Kent Williams&amp;rsquo;s core seems as solid as a rock.</description>

      <description>Suppose you have three sets of data: Customers, Orders, Products.
You want to present three dropdownlists&amp;ndash;one for each set of data. When I select a Customer from list A, list is rebuilt with Orders for that customer, the first order is selected, and list C is updated with the Products for that order, the first Product selected.
Using ASP.NET postbacks is pretty straightforward, but it&amp;rsquo;s also pretty ugly. Al Alberto got us most of the way to a solution with this article on CodeProject.</description>

      <description>I forgive Michael Crichton for the lack of details I criticized in part one. He had an important story to tell, and the color of Peter EvansÂs walls were irrelevant.
Irrelevant.
That word comes up again and again, but in CrichtonÂs text and in the readerÂs mind. While reading State of Fear, I found myself using that term, boldly, even rudely, in numerous conversations and arguments. So much of what the left says is irrelevant.</description>

      <description>Thanks to a scientist at MIT.
Everyone needs to read this article to understand how environmental scientists lie and how the media and well-meaning idiots throughout the land fall prey.
UPDATE: Dean Esmay examines a WSJ story on the hockey stick.

      <description>Thanks to St. Louis Post-Dispatch columnist Bernie Miklasz for giving me some categories to score. More New Year&amp;rsquo;s posts at OTB
Biggest Bust: Howard Dean fell from coronated Democrat nominee to historical hiccough by screaming like a WWF nut after getting trounced in Iowa. Is there a more embarrassing position than Deaniac?
Honorable mention to John Kerry.
Biggest Boom: The United States economy. While EU countries trudge along with 10% unemployment and flat growth, the United States has begun a fundamentally solid and sustainable rally that will continue for another 4 years.</description>

      <description>Last year, I hit about .500 on my predictions using my own, friendly measures. This year, though, is a bit tougher without an election to predict.
Tsunami
The disease outbreak won&amp;rsquo;t be as bad as the fearmongers at the UN hope. Still, the total human damage from the quakes will reach 200,000&amp;ndash;a massive loss of life.
The UN and the Bush Administration will have their final, irreparable falling-out over Bush&amp;rsquo;s coalition of aid.</description>

      <description>The United Nations serves no worthwhile purpose. The United States should immediately withdraw from the UN and banish it&amp;rsquo;s buildlings from our shores. We should begin by refusing to participate in any UN emergency aid for countries victimized by the Christmas tsunami.
Why? Because America provides 40% of the total world charity while comprising less than 5% of the population, but the smug bastards at the UN call us stingy.</description>

Dear Mr. Muscara:
I just read the story in the Hampton Union about your misguided decision to bar a student from a dance because he wore a Santa costume.
You, Mr. Muscara, are a small, weak man.
Contrary to your statement that &amp;ldquo;we have a separation of church and state,&amp;rdquo; what we have is a protection of religious practice. Congress shall make no law .</description>

      <description>People who hated Christmas used to bother me. I hated hearing their diatribes about commercialism and expense and depression.
Over the years, though, my dreamy view of Christmas tarnished.
I can&amp;rsquo;t remember many Christmas presents from childhood, but I do remember so many other wonderful things. I think it was 1975 when Uncle Bob and Aunt Carol came over on Christmas Eve. They sat in the dining room with my Mom and Dad drinking and laughing.</description>

      <description>Did you know that no study has ever shown a correlation between quality of education and per-pupil spending among public schools?
Did you know that in New York City, only 55% of education budget goes to instruction?
Did you know that the higher the administrators to students ratio, the worse the education?
Did you know that teacher to pupil ratio is a lousy predictor of education quality?
Did you know that three of the worst school districts in the country are in the top five in spending per pupil?</description>

      <description>Time Magazine&amp;rsquo;s Man of the Year title often makes a mockery of the honor. Remember the PC?
This year, though, Time&amp;rsquo;s editors got it right. Tempted, no doubt, to embarrass their political enemy, the editors took the high road by selecting George W. Bush, the most remarkable President in half a century, as its Man of the Year, 2004.
   For sticking to his guns (literally and figuratively), for reshaping the rules of politics to fit his ten-gallon-hat leadership style and for persuading a majority of voters that he deserved to be in the White House for another four years, George W.</description>

      <description>Last week, I came across the news story about 12 homes under construction set ablaze in Maryland and used it to discuss eco-terrorism. Yesterday, authorities arrested a man named Aaron Speed. He is not known as an eco-terrorist, and apparently had no motive. Speeds works as a security guard protecting the home allegedly torched.
Something seems wrong here. While Speed has a history of mental illness, he reminds me of the guy they arrested in Atlanta for detonating a bomb during the Olympics.</description>

      <description>The DUers are really torn over Michael Crichton&amp;rsquo;s book, &amp;ldquo;State of Fear.&amp;rdquo; Many of them clearly don&amp;rsquo;t want you or anyone else to read the book. (&amp;ldquo;Once I put it down, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t pick it up!&amp;quot;)
Others try to arm readers with information to counter Crichton&amp;rsquo;s charges in the book. The counter-arguments are miserably lame and usually non-responsive to the charge. In other words, &amp;ldquo;we know we&amp;rsquo;re wrong, so change the subject.</description>

      <description>I live in Wildwood, Missouri, where traffic light cameras are popping up at all the intersections where new traffic signals are installed. It seems a new traffic signal is installed every week, too.
I heard Walter Williams talking last year about these devices increasing the number of accidents and the number fatal accidents at intersections where they&amp;rsquo;re installed.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the reason:
  The cameras aren&amp;rsquo;t cheap, but the manufacturers sell the city council on the ROI.</description>

I still haven&amp;rsquo;t reached a new decision on the death penalty. I&amp;rsquo;m in a no-man&amp;rsquo;s land where I want the death penalty to be available to juries, but I don&amp;rsquo;t that I could ever condemn a stranger.</description>

      <description>Ron Bilancia has a long post on DemocraticUnderground.org that attempts to use the movie &amp;ldquo;Miracle,&amp;rdquo; about the 1980 US Olympic Hockey Team, as roadmap for the Democrat party.
I agree with much of what Ron writes, but why are Democrats so godawful afraid to say &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re Americans?&amp;rdquo;
Bilancia catches most of the keys to the 1980 team&amp;rsquo;s success: brilliant coach, team play, focus, creativity, hard work, working for something outside yourself, and staying on the offensive.</description>

      <description>Mahmoud Abbas, the likeliest successor to Yassir Arafat, has called on Palestinians to lay down their arms.
When Arafat&amp;rsquo;s death proves sufficient to reduce tensions in the Middle East and maybe give some Israelis and Palestinians a chance to live out their lives without daily terror, the United Nations and its amen corner in America and France will look like idiots for fawning over Arafat so many years.
Arafat was a terrorist, self-serving hate-monger.</description>

I have vacillated on the death penalty for several years, beginning with witnessing the implosion of the old St. Louis Arena. (Long story.) But let&amp;rsquo;s give credit where it&amp;rsquo;s due: the death penalty itself.
Never having been a proponent of the deterrent of the death penalty, I have maintained that capital punishment can be defended on two grounds:</description>

Whether or not exhaustion gets the credit, US and Afghan military have captured two high value targets, including Mullah Omar&amp;rsquo;s personal security chief.
With these arrests, perhaps we&amp;rsquo;ll finally nab Omar. My guess is that, if he knows anything about Bin Laden&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts, he&amp;rsquo;ll sing.</description>

      <description>Surprise!  Unable to even maintain their numbers in Congress through the ballot box, the Democrat leadership in the Senate will spend time &amp;ldquo;investigating&amp;rdquo; the Bush administration&amp;ndash;without subpoena power.
They could do everyone a favor by hiring Michael Moore to conduct the investigations, and meet at Teddy&amp;rsquo;s house the 3rd Friday of every month for popcorn and videos. And lots of scotch.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finished the first 100 or so pages of Michael Crichton&amp;rsquo;s new book, State of Fear. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging about the book for a week, I owe some thoughts.
First, the story has grabbed me. The action begins quickly. While some reviewers have crticized the number of characters and the variety of venues, I find the pace excellent.
Second, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for massive debunking of wacko global warming theories, the book will start slowly.</description>

Few leftist utterings irritate me more than the environmental nonsense that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard since about 1990. It all started with my knowledge of freon, particularly R-12 and R-114. I spent 10 years in the submarine force. Freon is a very dangerous gas on submarines because of its weight and its tendancy to turn into phosgene gas upon heating.</description>

      <description>What in God&amp;rsquo;s holy name does the Microsoft search engine do?
I can type the exact same entry into three or four separate engines and get back, more or less, the same results. Then, I enter the same search&amp;ndash;langa cleanxp&amp;ndash;into MSN&amp;rsquo;s search and get back goofy results. I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed this for a couple of years, but since launching their &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; search engine in November, the problem seems to be getting worse.</description>

      <description>Catholic parishes in St. Louis, Boston, and other US cities are closing for financial reasons. The church, you see, lost income and paid millions in judgements and settlements to victims of its child-molester priests.
Parishoners are rebelling, though. In St. Louis, the archdioces ordered St. Stanislaus Polish parish to turn over its assets to the archdioces. The parish said &amp;ldquo;no,&amp;rdquo; appealed to the Vatican, and lost. The parishoners continue to fight the turnover.</description>

He has, though, picked up the rhetoric bulls**t where he dropped off when the loser, Kerry, kicked his lilly-white rearend out of the DNC primaries. He demanded that aGOP state chairman resign for making a rather innocuous observation, to wit:
   ÂThe Democrats simply have refused to learn the lessons of the past two election cycles, and now they can be accurately called the party of Barbara Boxer, Lynne Stewart and Howard Dean.</description>

Today, playing with a 3rd string running back, Arlen Harris, and a delapidated quarter, Chris Chandler, the Rams threw six&amp;ndash;count &amp;lsquo;em, six&amp;ndash;interceptions to the Carolina Panthers, all but forcing the Panthers to win.
The Rams gave up 3 opportunities to kick field goals, which would have made the score 20-16 late in the 4th quarter. As usual, they managed the clock poorly.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Joe Gandelman writing on Dean&amp;rsquo;s World, I just read George Will&amp;rsquo;s attempt at restoring sanity to liberalism and its party, the DNC. In this analysis, Will blames the stockpiling losses on liberalsm&amp;rsquo;s condescension, disrespect, and distrust of most Americans.
Will uses as an example a quote from Robert Kuttner writing in the leftist American Prospect:
        &amp;ldquo;Bill Clinton won election by declaring, as a matter of values, that people who work hard and play by the rules should not be poor.</description>

The report was promised on Tuesday of this week, then on Wednesday. Now, insiders say maybe January. My bet would be &amp;ndash; never.

      <description>Professor Bainbridge quotes at length an essay by Andrew Bacevich in today&amp;rsquo;s Wall Street Journal which concludes a) we are over-extended in Iraq and Afghanistan, and b) Bush&amp;rsquo;s choices are &amp;ldquo;stark&amp;rdquo;. Those choice are: bring the troops home and use &amp;ldquo;other means&amp;rdquo; to battle terrorism, or grow the Army. Professor Bainbridge would be willing to raise taxes to build an 18 division Army.
If we are over-extended, and we might not be yet, I think there is a third option.</description>

I wonder why? The news is definitely good. Sex taints things. For all the glory of sex, it changes relationships, lives, feelings. Innocence is such a wonderful thing. If you&amp;rsquo;re young, preserve it, defend it, treasure it. Losing belief in Santa is no one&amp;rsquo;s happiest memory.

Anyway, his sabbatical didn&amp;rsquo;t last long. He published two op-ed pieces in the New York Times this week, both railing against partial privatization of Social Security.
His argument? There is no Social Security crisis.</description>

I hope this kid matures enough to feel the shame he brought upon himself by taking a cowardly way out of hard work. I&amp;rsquo;d like to see his just war theory as written prior to 9/11.

      <description>Not since college in the early 1980s have I spent as much time reading what liberals have to write as I have since the election. Much of what I&amp;rsquo;ve read demanded an immediate response. Some, though, stewed in my mind until it has, just now, reached a consistency worth serving to my readers.
I know that the liberals didn&amp;rsquo;t really care for Kerry. He isn&amp;rsquo;t their hero or idol. They don&amp;rsquo;t respect him, really.</description>

 Having lost a significant portion of its armaments in our attack on Fallujah and the corollary fight in Mosul, the terrorists sense an end game. They are going down in a blaze of glory. From the[ Associate Press via MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6577206/):       Brazen gunmen firing automatic weapons roamed BaghdadÂs streets Monday within blocks of the countryÂs most fortified facilities, including the U.</description>

      <description>The FBI believes that dozens of home fires in Maryland may be the work of eco-terrorists. Apparently, carbon dioxide produced from intentionally set house fires doesn&amp;rsquo;t contribute to global warming.
UPDATE: Michelle Malkin has a thorough list of Ecoterrorism&amp;rsquo;s recent history.

      <description>According to CNN, Ohio has certified the election.
I feel sorry for the folks at DemocraticUnderground who convinced themselves that Ohio would end up in the Kerry camp and thousands of GOP voters would end up in jail.
Blogs for Bush has some interesting polling data.

      <description>I donÂt know what gets the blameÂpolitical correctness, pop culture, declining understanding of the subtleties of language, or just timeÂbut I miss some words. I wish people used them more often.
SpatÂand the past of other verbs that end with Â-it.Â Instead of Âspat,Â I hear only ÂspitÂ used for any tense. ÂHe spat on me,Â lends an air of dignity that Âhe spit on meÂ lacks.
SpittleÂanother victim of the ubiquitous verb.</description>

      <description>Outside the Beltway examines Michael Scheuer&amp;rsquo;s column in Los Angeles Times.
One point I&amp;rsquo;d add: The reason American people are outraged over Clinton&amp;rsquo;s failure to take out Bin Laden in 1998 and 1999 is that they don&amp;rsquo;t know. The press did a fine job of filtering out any criticism of the Clinton admin.
Remember Howard Fineman&amp;rsquo;s admission in October? That the MSM would report only bad news about Iraq until the end of the campaign?</description>

      <description>Back in December 2003, I blogged my predictions for 2004, Part I and Part II. Later, I added my 2004 resolutions. LetÂs see how I did. (My 20/20 hindsight is** in bold**.)
PREDICTIONS:
Economy
The US economy will continue to expand at the fast pace since the Reagan administration through the second quarter. While new home construction will slow, service and other sectors will more than take its place. Unemployment will improve in fits and starts, but it will be more than half a percentage point lower by the end of the second quarter as the economy creates 100,000 more jobs than existed at the peak in April 2000.</description>

      <description>The Wall Street Journal is out with its top ten trends. (You may need to subscribe to WSJonline. I do, so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.) According to my favorite daily, here&amp;rsquo;s what to expect in ten industries:
Fashion: Plain is out; vibrant is in.
Autos: Uncertainty. The SUV craze is waning, but nothing seems to fill the void. In my opinion, hybrids, especially big ones, may become de rigeur.
Publishing: Fewer reads, more material will lead publishers to jump on some craze, like the spiritualism of the 90s or journaling/letters of last year.</description>

      <description>This is from a peace rally somewhere. Does this Nancyboy Junior Lefty really look he needs someone to tell him not to bully weaker kids? And do his teachers ask him whether Saddam bullied people? Perhaps he should learn about the brides Saddam&amp;rsquo;s sons routinely raped on their wedding nights. Perhaps he should learn about the mass graves in Kurdish north. Perhaps he should be lifting weights instead of holding idiotic signs that make him look like a pansy.</description>

We believe that governments exist at the will of and to serve the governed.
We believe that a government&amp;rsquo;s only powers are those surrendered to it by those it governs, and that the governed may, at any time, reclaim their powers or deny the government of them.
We believe that the individual is free to do as he wishes within the rules set forth by the majority of his fellow citizens and their elected representatives.</description>

      <description>Kofi Annan&amp;rsquo;s tenure as UN Secretary-General ranks as one of the most massive failings in modern leadership. Two American presidents and hundreds of thousands of American troops filled the void left by Annan&amp;rsquo;s abrogation of responsibility. In case you&amp;rsquo;ve missed the headlines, Kofi Annan presided over the slaughter of nearly one million people in Rwanda, the enslavement and systematic murders of millions in Sudan, the rise to emminence of Islamic terrorists, Saddam Hussein&amp;rsquo;s theft of billions, and the orchestrated attempt to eliminate Israel.</description>

Let me repeat: The President of the United States rescued one of his body guards from a fight with other body guards.
George W. Bush is the coolest president since Teddy Roosevelt. These are the moments that define men at the pinnacle.
The president is supposed to walk away, seek the safety of other leaders and security agents.</description>

My point: Âthere may be rational moral arguments against corporations, but they are as pointless as moral arguments against thinking bad thoughts. Without the security of a stock or bond and the protection of arms-length ownership, few intelligent people would invest in individuals who have what might be a good idea.</description>

      <description>According to MSNBC, Secretary of State Colin Powell has submitted his resignation.
Having served as SoS during the most critical time since World War II, Powell must be exhausted. I am not Powell&amp;rsquo;s biggest fan, having learned much about him from several of his lieutenants when he was still a general in the Army. But he did a remarkable job under very tough circumstances. He deserves our sincerest thanks for a life of service to his country.</description>

      <description>Not since college in the early 1980s have I spent as much time reading what liberals have to write as I have since the election. Much of what I&amp;rsquo;ve read demanded an immediate response. Some, though, stewed in my mind until it has, just now, reached a consistency worth serving to my readers.
I know that the liberals didn&amp;rsquo;t really care for Kerry. He isn&amp;rsquo;t their hero or idol. They don&amp;rsquo;t respect him, really.</description>

Read their minds, which they merrily open to the world the way a dirty old man reveals his naked body to school children.</description>

      <description>American military policy as most of us know it evolved in response to the Cold War. The Soviet Union represented a military commanderÂs worst nightmare: equal or superior strength in numbers, technology, and intelligence, combined with a desire to conquer the world.
But, as we found in the 1990s, the Soviet Union was also a military commanderÂs dream: a formidable adversary requiring American and NATO vigilance in the forms of large, new weapons systems, enormous training budgets, and hands-off intelligence programs.</description>

      <description>Jimmy Carter will probably attend Yassir Arafat&amp;rsquo;s funeral service in Cairo, Egypt. How typical of the man who considers the American Revolution a low point in world history.
Yassir Arafat was a tyrant, a murderer, a thief, a shameless self-promoter, a liar, a welcher whose ego killed more Palestinians than all of Israel&amp;rsquo;s weapons. While the UN and its amen chorus denounced Israel&amp;rsquo;s terrorism fence and the poverty Israel supposedly forced upon the Palestinians, Arafat moved hundreds of million of dollars to France&amp;ndash;money that might have alleviated Palestinian suffering.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that the liberal MSM would smear John Ashcroft in his retirement as they&amp;rsquo;ve smeared him throughout his career. But Newsweek&amp;rsquo;s coverage of Ashcroft is over the top. Their lead story, Ashcroft&amp;rsquo;s legacy, is an interview with a single person, David Cole, who has a toolshedfull of axes to grind with the outgoing Attorney General.
While liberals always have and always will hate Ashcroft, make up stories about him, accuse him of everything from fascism to the Johnstown Flood, this treatment is beyond the pale.</description>

      <description>According to posters to liberal forums, conservatives have a monopoly on violence. But some young Democrats, it seems, have learned their lessons from the union thugs who destroyed numerous Bush-Cheney and Republican offices prior to the election.
Three high school seniors who supported Kerry beat a Bush supporter with baseball bat and chains after school yesterday.
The SAINT PAUL PIONEER PRESS reported in morning editions: The argument began earlier in the day Thursday with a discussion about candidates the minors had supported for president, Backstrom said.</description>

At the time, John Ashcroft was Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Attorney-General who was seeking to replace Kit Bond as Governor.
As we slithered between preppily dressed bodies in the once glamorous hotel, a shout came from up ahead, repeated in various voices of shock and amazement.</description>

      <description>Sorry. I know I should let them have their hissy fits in private, but when people who publicly claim to be intellectually, educationally, and morally superior to me spew nonsense, I have to point it out.
Please read this post on today&amp;rsquo;s du.org. This girl says that we conservatives can&amp;rsquo;t be reasoned with, then goes on to say she has cut ties with all of her friends who support Bush, because, like our troops in Iraq, all conservatives are evil (emphases mine):</description>

      <description>This Jonah Goldberg piece in The Corner is a classic&amp;ndash;one to print on acid-free paper and keep in a safe place.
Nod to INDC Journal.
Goldberg makes a point that I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to make since Phil Collins was just Genesis&amp;rsquo;s drummer:
   What Maher, Raines, and Smiley fail to grasp is that all morality is based upon transcendence &amp;ndash; or it is merely based on utilitarianism of one kind or another, and therefore it is not morality so much as, at best, an enlightened expediency or will-to-power.</description>

      <title>Will Liberals Stop Supporting Troops?</title>

      <description>Arguing with Sign Posts reminds me that liberals continue to say things that seem, well, silly. But some liberals are teetering frightening close to the truth.
Someone posting to the democraticunderground.org forum ponders whether it&amp;rsquo;s time for liberals to stop supporting Âour troops.Â Her reasoning goes thusly: George Bush is a known evil; those who support Bush support evil; 72% of American service members in Iraq supported George Bush; therefore; 72% of American service member in Iraq are evil.</description>

      <description>The assault on Fallujah has begun. 10,000 of the bravest Americans and Iraqis are about test their mettle. God bless them all. May each return to his family with all of his faculties.
How dare we forget the struggles of the few for the many. May those who must fall in fighting find fast, safe passage to eternal salvation, and may they one day welcome us, the beneficiaries of the their sacrifice, into God&amp;rsquo;s waiting arms.</description>

      <description>Listening to Mr. Gould&amp;rsquo;s presentation on Thursday, I was struck by the fact that I have a lot to do. We have a gold mine of information available in the database. We can use technology in many ways to enhance our outreach to the top tier contributors.
I hope, in the coming weeks, to find ways to help this effort. We will need some custom programming to maximize the value of the database.</description>

      <description>The Canadian government reports a six-fold increase in page accesses of its immigration site. The increase came from the United States on Wednesday and Thursday as un-American liberal sore losers considered renouncing their American citizenship for Canada.
Go. Please.
On election night, PBS commentator and anti-American Bill Moyers conjectured that, should Kerry win, there would be right-wing coup d&amp;rsquo;etat to overthrow the government. As is almost always the case when a liberal opens his mouth to speak, Bill Moyers was 180 degrees out.</description>

      <description>Liberals (and you should check out CaptainNormal.com, democraticunderground.com, or Jane Smiley&amp;rsquo;s vituperations in Slate.com) want us to believe that a few ignorant, hate-filled yahoos in a handful of places like Macon, Georgia and Waco, Texas gave this election to President Bush. They think they, not the 58 million who voted for Bush, are the majority.
USA Today has given us a county-by-county map of the election. If I were a Blue American, I&amp;rsquo;d be worried.</description>

      <description>George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s achievement in the election of 2004 ranks as one of the greatest political achievements of a century.
Elected without a popular vote mandate in a contested election that was unsettled for six weeks, Bush began his first term at a sharp disadvantage. Liberals hated him, lambasting him as a buffoon, an idiot, a redneck moron from West Texas who was too stupid to tie shoes, much less run a country.</description>

      <description>Just took a quick trip through DemocraticUnderground. Hehehehehe. Oh, there&amp;rsquo;s such joy in Mudville.
My favorite posts, summarized:
 Everyone who voted for Bush is a toothless, SUV-driving, NASCAR-watching, illiterate who doesn&amp;rsquo;t deserve to vote America will become a 3rd world country Calling for boycotts of all American products by both Americans and everyone else in the world Begging Canada to annex the blue states. (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d stand in the way) Virtually hugs to liberals in red states who have to live amongst brain-dead idiots Hopes that radical Islamists will kill all American soldiers in the Middle East  Folks, these are the sentiments of the people we just defeated.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not buying the story that yesterday&amp;rsquo;s leaked, mid-day exit poll results were innocently in err. No way. They were intentionally skewed toward Kerry to discourage Bush votes in the afternoon and evening.
This was shameful. Again and again in this election, the MSM have used their power to influence the vote. Again and again, they were thwarted by the will of the people. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s have the will of the people dismantle the MSM.</description>

      <description>The networks and newspapers are not calling states they know Bush has won in order to not force Kerry to concede. As Jay Cost points out, this is disgraceful.
I will call it. Bush has now won Nevada, New Mexico, Iowa, and Ohio. He has won the popular vote. George W. Bush has been re-elected to a second term as President of the United States by the will of its free citizens.</description>

 The American people have re-elected President Bush The American people have given his party a stronger hand in the US Senate The American people have given his party a stronger hand in the US House of Representatives The American people have given his party a stronger hand in state governorships  Taken together, Election 2004 can be seen as nothing short of an endorsement of President Bush&amp;rsquo;s policies and the Republic view of our country and its place in the world.</description>

      <description>John Kerry has apparently decided to contest the presidential election in the courts by forcing Ohio, to count its 150,000 provisional ballots. Should that fail, perhaps he&amp;rsquo;ll sue everyone who voted for Bush. If John Kerry forces a prolonged fight in Ohio, he will have assured himself an ignoble, despised place in American history.
In 2000, Al Gore had several factors on his side that somewhat supported his challenges:

      <description>On most of the East Coast and Midwest. At the top of the hour, projections have Kerry up 77 to 66. South Carolina, Virginia, and North Carolina&amp;ndash;all states where Bush is almost certain to win&amp;ndash;are still not called.
Bush is leading among the votes counted in Ohio and Florida.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think it will be a long night. We should know something by 10:00 PM CST&amp;ndash;11:00 in the east.   </description>

      <description>For what it&amp;rsquo;s worth&amp;ndash;this is my most optimistic guess:
Beginning with WSJ&amp;rsquo;s 216-203 Bush, I see the Toss Ups falling like this:
Bush 216 + 63 = 279 (winner)
Kerry 203 + 52 = 255 (loser)
Popular vote: Bush 50-Kerry 48-Nader/others &amp;lt;1.
Senate: GOP + 4
House: GOP + 4
Likely alternatiaves (in order of probability):
 Bush wins Florida Kerry wins Ohio Bush wins Pennsylvannia Kerry wins Minnesota Kerry wins Wisconsin Bush wins Michigan Kerry wins New Mexico Bush wins Hawaii    </description>

Then I carried on inside.
They won&amp;rsquo;t be there when I go out.

What could be more demonstrative of the Democrat intellectualism than these stories.Â They send sub-human union neanderthals to smash up Republican campaign offices because they&amp;rsquo;re afraid of losing on merit.Â Then again, isn&amp;rsquo;t the purpose of unionism to eliminate merit-based rewards?</description>

      <description>Read for yourself. My headline is my judgement. (Thanks to Drudge)
Coupled with Howard Fineman&amp;rsquo;s assessment that the press has moral reasons to bury news that might help Bush, the conspiracy of the MSM against the president is more or less conceded by the conspirators themselves. Does anyone care?

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t see or hear the debate. Instead, I read bloggers&amp;rsquo; reactions this morning. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I found:
Instapundit&amp;rsquo;s concensus reading is the Bush won by fighting to a draw. After the president&amp;rsquo;s miserable performance in debate one, this makes some sense.
Andrew Sullivan called it a draw.
Dean&amp;rsquo;s World reviewers took the president.
The Corner, though, is the interesting one. Based on the times of the posts, I&amp;rsquo;d say that Bush was miserable for first 40 minutes or so.</description>

      <description>You and the rest of the main stream have timed things well. Let the President rise a bit, then flood the airwaves and papers with bad news. Leave anything positive about the war on terrorism on deep, inside pages in 2-point print. Let Kerry make a great comeback.
No, Mr. Fineman, the President doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound desperate. He sounds like a candidate. He sounds full-throated and eager. His pathetic performance in debate one&amp;ndash;so reminiscent of his dad&amp;rsquo;s in debate 2 in 1992&amp;ndash;woke him.</description>

      <description>If Kerry has his way, the price of an abortion will increase dramatically, because Kerry wants the government to pay for them.
For years I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained that the ridiculous cost of a college class is the fault of the government&amp;rsquo;s insane college assistance program. Providing funding for the difference between what a student can afford and what a college charges is a salesman&amp;rsquo;s dream come true.
Imagine if the government did the same for homes.</description>

I trained my focus on lighter things and happier sounds.
I let myself laugh at things that I wouldnÂt have before.
I let myself cry when babies laughed or someone, with
Just the right inflection and sincerity, said, ÂGod Bless
AmericaÂ or ÂLook at that rainbowÂthere.Â
But the darkness didnÂt turn its back on me, for sure.

      <description>Dick Cheney is really, really good. He should be on more often. He instills confidence.
John Edwards on Global Test: Yes, there is a global veto, but Senator Kerry said we will never give anyone a veto on American use of force. Another waffle.
ÂJohn Kerry will never give control of the security of the United States of America to another country.Â What about the UN? ItÂs not a country.</description>

      <description>Only the blindness of emotional loyalty would allow someone to watch the first of 3 presidential debates and conclude that President Bush demonstrated he was fit to run the country. As a partisan, I was embarrassed. It was as bad as Nixon&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;well, I&amp;rsquo;m not a crook&amp;rdquo; press conference. Bush didn&amp;rsquo;t look guilty of anything; he just didn&amp;rsquo;t look particularly interested. Like his father in 1992, Bush 43 had better things to do.</description>

      <description>I think that most of our allies&amp;ndash;meaning more than 50% of the populations of the several countrie&amp;ndash;are Nancy boys. The Germans, the French, as individual human beings, are inferior to Americans in most ways. They are inferior athletes, inferior writers, inferior scientists, inferior fighters. Except for whining, crying, and cowaring behind Uncle Sam&amp;rsquo;s red, white, and blue pants, I can&amp;rsquo;t think of anything the people in these two countries, and most of Europe, do better than Americans.</description>

      <description>In this front page NYTimes.com story, the paper argues that Democrats are pummelling Republicans in registering new voters in swing states, specifically, Florida and Ohio. Looking at the headline, one might conclude that Kerry is gaining momentum. If you read more, then do a little independent work, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to reach a different conclusion.
Okay, so the Democrats are better at getting people to register. No doubt. In St. Louis, Missouri, the Democrat machine is canvassing cemetaries all weekend.</description>

      <description>While only 8% of Republics are ashamed of their jobs. What other conclusion can we draw from the fact that, according to OpenSecrets.org, 1 in 4 donors to John Kerry&amp;rsquo;s campaign refuses to disclose his employer or occupation while 92% of Bush contributors proudly disclose theirs.
Under federal law, candidates and parties are required to make reasonable efforts to determine the occupation and employer of all contributors. While Republicans are frequently fined by the FEC for failing to identify the occupuations of 5-10% of donors, Democrats generally skate by with 15% non-disclosure with no fines.</description>

      <description>National Review Online has a link to a story about soldiers in Iraq who&amp;rsquo;ve created a website that allows us back home to buy a beer for a soldier over the internet. What a great idea. I&amp;rsquo;ve added their site to my blogroll, or you can click this. I&amp;rsquo;ve already donated $20.00, because soldiers need beer.
On another front, I&amp;rsquo;ve removed Andrew Sullivan&amp;rsquo;s blog from the blogroll. I&amp;rsquo;m not happy about this, because Andrew offers superior writing and, until recently, superior thinking.</description>

      <description>Looking back through some old entries, I came across this one: Al Qaeda Threatens Europe. from July 1. Almost 3 months later, the threatened 9/11-caliber attacks haven&amp;rsquo;t taken place.
About the same time, some liberal mags were speculating that al Qaeda&amp;rsquo;s capacity to carry out spectacular acts of terrorism has been so greatly diminished that the Bush administration is being disingenuous by even mentioning the terrorism threat as a real risk.</description>

There is something chilling in reading this article top to bottom, perhaps more so because 1972 is the beginning of my political awakening.
My parents were naturally Democrats, and I grew up in the very Democrat, blue-collar neighborhood of Southwest St. Louis where Scullin Steel once cast a sulfur cloud shadow over the old frame houses built in the declining days of the Jazz Age.</description>

      <description>In the crassest act of political desparation since Richard Nixon waved the list of communist contributors in Helen Gehagen Douglas&amp;rsquo;s face, John Kerry today told the heroic interim PM of Iraq that the PM doesn&amp;rsquo;t know Iraq as well as Kerry does.
Well, consider the source. John Kerry believes that the world was a better place when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan. John Kerry believes that Iraq was a better place when Saddam was presiding over the murders of 300,000 people and the tortures of 5,000,000 and the enslavement of the nation.</description>

      <description>The Bush administration violated several of my rules of war in Iraq:
 Do not let politicians make military decisions; do not let generals make political decisions.  Tommy Franks has admitted that the declaration of the end of major combat operations was his idea. He hoped that by convincing President Bush to make that public declaration, our former &amp;ldquo;allies&amp;rdquo; would jump in to help rebuild Iraq. As a result, we stopped aggressive fighting before we had killed enough enemy.</description>

      <description>One thing we&amp;rsquo;ve learned from the CBS Memogate unraveling: if you need to get in touch with the Kerry Campaign, call CBS News.
CBS has admitted that its producer, Mary Mapes, arranged for a telephone conversation between Bill Burkett, source of the infamous memos, and Joe Lockhart, senior advisor to Senator Kerry and former Clinton press secretary.
According to USA Today new ethics experts, the contacts raise serious ethics questions, pointing to the possibility that CBS is using its power as a major television news network to influence the outcome of the Presidential election according to its liberal bias.</description>

 One year suspension of credentials to all federal government offices and events. Ban CBS from the presidential debates this fall.  These steps will ensure that the reorganized CBS News staff place objectivity and ethics before party politics and sensationalism.</description>

      <description>Ed Gillespie on CBS&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities:
&amp;ldquo;In an effort to regain the trust of the American people CBS should not only investigate the process that led to the use of these documents but they should identify immediately those engaged in possible criminal activity who attempted to use a news organization to affect the outcome of a Presidential election in its closing days.&amp;rdquo;

Senator will reinstate Saddam as president of the Middle East country, provided the Iraqis haven&amp;rsquo;t already executed the former despot.
&amp;ldquo;Democracy has gone too far,&amp;rdquo; Kerry told an audience of students in New York. &amp;ldquo;Some people, like most of the Middle East, do better under dictatorships and monarchies than under anything like a democratic-republic.</description>

      <description>Professional Bush-hater and admitted liar, Bill Burkett, has hastened the departures of Dan Rather and John Kerry from the national scene.
On Saturday, Burkett says he provided &amp;ldquo;information&amp;rdquo; on Bush&amp;rsquo;s National Guard record to the Kerry campaign via former Sentator Max Cleland.  While Burkett did not specify what that information was, it is clear that it included the forged memos that, eventually, found their way to CBS and Dan Rather.</description>

      <description>The Gallup organization shows the President has a commanding 13-point lead in its latest poll of likely voters conducted in the past week. A Pew Research Group poll conducted during roughly the same period finds the race a dead heat at 46% to 46%.
The Gallup poll was conducted normally. The Pew people tried something new, by conducting the poll in two phases. Whether that accounts for the difference, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but somebody is wrong here.</description>

When your friends tell you it&amp;rsquo;s over, it&amp;rsquo;s over. Dan Rather is, right now, Richard Nixon being told he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the votes in the Senate to acquit.
What bothers me is how the MSM will treat Rather after he confesses. Instead of riding him out on a rail, he will be honored for his &amp;ldquo;remarkable courage.</description>

  A retired Major General whom CBS News claimed corroborated the Killian memos says that CBS lied to him. According to ABC News, Maj.

      <description>For many reasons, I decided that I would not actively work for the Bush campaign this year as I did in 2000. Those reasons are personal, so I won&amp;rsquo;t explain here.
However, after CBS collaborated with the Democrats to cheat by creating and airing fraudulant documents, I have no choice but to join the fight. I will be spending a lot of my spare time working for the campaign here on out, so my blog might go empty for a day here and there.</description>

      <title>Dan Rather Suicide Watch:  Day 1</title>

      <description>Senator John Kerry, when asked about Admirla Boorda&amp;rsquo;s suicide a few years back, commented that suicide is probably the appropriate response to disclosure that one knowingly wore military decorations not officially awarded.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure, then, that the Senator would agree that intentionally passing fraudulent documents as real in order to influence a presidential election is also grounds for suicide. Therefore, I am herewith launching the Dan Rather Suicide Watch.
Shortly, we&amp;rsquo;ll introduce contests for Pick the Time and Date, Pick the Method, and Write Dan&amp;rsquo;s Suicide Note which we&amp;rsquo;ll have certified as authentic by CBS&amp;rsquo;s own Marcel Matley.</description>

      <description>I watched the CBS Evening News tonight, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the competition. NBC and ABC were unable to find a single forensic document specialist who believe the documents on CBS News were legitimate. These included former FBI document experts now teaching forensics at universities.
Apparently, the only expert who thinks Jerry Killian typed and signed the CBS papers is the CBS employee featured on their broadcast tonight.
Funny&amp;ndash;the liberal press isn&amp;rsquo;t rallying to CBS&amp;rsquo;s side.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I conjectured that Dan Rather fabricated the Bush ANG documents as a vendetta against the Bushes for 41&amp;rsquo;s undressing of Rather on the CBS Evening News in 1988&amp;ndash;the interview that turned the election in Bush&amp;rsquo;s favor. Apparently, I&amp;rsquo;m not alone. Here&amp;rsquo;s an interesting quote from Powerline:
 Last night, it was reported that senior executives at CBS News were promising an investigation. Today, Dan Rather is personally vouching for the documents&amp;rsquo; authenticity.</description>

      <description>Something on TimeIsAFactor.com caught my attention.
One of the 4 CBS memos about George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s National Guard service contains the following memo supposedly authored by his commanding officer:
&amp;ldquo;Bush wasn&amp;rsquo;t here during rating period and I don&amp;rsquo;t have any feedback from 187th in Alabama. I will not rate.&amp;rdquo;
Having spent 9 years as an enlisted Personnel Officer in the Navy, the marks on Bush&amp;rsquo;s fitness report for the period he was in Alabama are the only ones that could be entered.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that two of the document CBS aired were fraudulent. Assuming that CBS News retracts them on tonight&amp;rsquo;s Evening News (and there are indications that Dan Rather will make and on-air apology), George Bush will win the election in November with an 8% to 12% popular vote margin and at least 100 vote margin in the Electoral College.
Why? The law of increasing returns, also known a piling on.</description>

      <description>On the CBS Evening News tonight, Dan Rather lied about the reasons for questioning the authenticity of the National Guard documents he likely typed at home before cutting and pasting a dead man&amp;rsquo;s signature.
He claimed that doubters asserted that the CGTimes font &amp;ldquo;was not available&amp;rdquo; in the 1970s. No, Dan, no one&amp;rsquo;s claiming that. Typography experts are claiming, though, that the proportional font was not available on common typewriters in 1972.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: ArguingWithSignposts has some quotes from Democrat and CBS insiders indicating that both the Kerry campaign, which gave the memos to 60 Minutes, and CBS had doubts about their validity. Good analysis . . . take a read.
CBS News has launched an internal investigation into the validity of documents related to George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s National Guard service that it aired on 60 Minutes, according to Drudge. Other developments overnight seem to make it more likely than not that at least two of the documents were forgeries&amp;ndash;with Killian&amp;rsquo;s signature electronically placed on a memo fabricated by Democrat operatives, then fed to CBS News.</description>

      <description>CNSNew.com is reporting that typography experts are fairly confident that documents exposed on CBS&amp;rsquo;s 60 Minutes II were fake. The documents, allegedly authored in 1972, used proportional fonts and superscript lettering, not widely available in 1972.
I am very familiar with the typewriter the Navy used in the 1980s: IBM Selectric III. It had changable font golfballs, one of which was proportional (CGTimes). But it looked awful. The proportional spacing was in consistent.</description>

      <description>250 private citizens &amp;ndash; Vietnam veterans all &amp;ndash; attacked John Kerry&amp;rsquo;s previously unscrutinized service record. It made news because Kerry is running for president.
CBS News and the Democrat National Party, now, are re-examining Bush&amp;rsquo;s National Guard service and spewing lies that were already answered and resolved in 2000.
I honestly do not remember a presidential campaign in which the media so forcefully and openly worked to elect one candidate over another.</description>

&amp;ldquo;By now, there are many of us loyal Democrats who feel uncomfortable in seeing that you have chosen the rich over the poor, unilateral pre-emptive war over a strong nation united with others for peace, lies and obfuscation over the truth and the political technique of character assassination as a way to win elections or to garner a few moments of applause,&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>In 16 months of war, 1,000 brave Americans have given their lives so that filthy, vile creatures could travel to New York to spit, bleed, and deficate on Republicans. During that same period it is estimated by the Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and other organizations, that
 1,250 college-age men and women between 18 and 24 years of age died by suicide. 53,000 Americans were killed in highway accidents.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you have a meeting with bin Laden? Invite him to the White House? Can you imagine if people who shoot children in the head ever came to power anywhere in the world?</description>

      <description>The National Review Online has this excellent, anonymous piece by a self-described disgruntled Democrat who attempts to explain why Zell Miller is so angry. It&amp;rsquo;s great reading, because I remember my dad, a lifelong Democrat, becoming angry in 1972 and voting for Nixon. He went back (I think) the Democrats in 1976, but four years of Jimmy Carter has made him a permament Republican.
Bottom line is this: Democrats will sell out their country to win an election.</description>

In West Virginia, Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America, gave Kerry a rifle as a gift. Kerry, a self-described gun-owner and hunter, quipped: **&amp;ldquo;I thank you for the gift, but I can&amp;rsquo;t take it to the debate with me.</description>

      <description>Turns out the President was a pretty good pilot, particularly in the classroom. This is from MSNBC:
   The records also indicate that Bush made good grades, scoring an 88 on total airmanship and earning perfect 100s for flying without navigational instruments, operating a T-38 System and studying applied aerodynamics. Other scores ranged from 89 in flight planning to 98 in aviation physiology.
 The new records are consistent with the President&amp;rsquo;s long-standing assertion that he trained regularly until 1972 when transfered to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign.</description>

CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC, New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times, AP, Reuters and the BBC are jointly sponsoring the program, which will pay $1,000,000 (US) to the Iraqi or foreign terrorist who kills the 1,000th American.
&amp;ldquo;This will be such a windfall for both news circulation [or viewership] and for the Kerry campaign that we all thought the person who delivers the story, so to speak, should share in the reward,&amp;rdquo; said a CNN spokesman on condition of anonymity.</description>

TWO PERCENT!!!!
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, George Bush&amp;rsquo;s convention earned him a smaller bounce than Kerry&amp;rsquo;s.
Interestingly, the 2 point bounce, according to the article on CNN.com, puts Bush at 52% to 45% for Kerry&amp;ndash;a seven point lead for Bush. I watch these polls, people, I can tell you that going into the convention, no on had Bush at 50%.</description>

      <description>Time and Newsweek polls released yesterday both show President Bush with an 11 point lead over challenger John Kerry. I know this because of www.drudgeport.com. I would never have known it looking at the major media websites.
CNN: Buried on politics page
MSNBC: Buried on politics page
Why do I single out these two? Because CNN and Time own a joint website, as do MSNBC and Newsweek. Basically, CNN and NBC refuse to report the results of their own polls because, like spoiled, petulant children, the polls don&amp;rsquo;t show what they want them to show.</description>

And his performance yesterday in defense of the President and in opposition to the President&amp;rsquo;s filthy detractors was stellar.

Amazon has suspended its rules of decorum for one book: Unfit for Command. The Amazon policy permits anyone to write anything about anyone&amp;ndash;short of profanity. Presumably, one can offer cash money for the assassination of the Swift Boat Veterans with Amazon&amp;rsquo;s ascent.

I think back to Republican demonstrations in Florida during the 2000 recount. Remember how the major media and every liberal across this great land clamored for harsh punishment for the Republicans?</description>

      <description>Looks like he&amp;rsquo;s tearing it up. So far, McCain, Guilliani, and Arnold have been the best 3 speeches I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen back-to-back-to-back at a political convention. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching these things since 1972.
Arnold, whom I laughed at when he announced his run for governor in California, is doing something no career politician could. He is doing what Reagan did in 1976. He is winning the convention.
Following on Monday&amp;rsquo;s performances, this is the most genuinely positive, upbeat GOP convention of my lifetime with the possible exception of 1984, when David Brinkley said of the conventioneers, &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re all so happy that can hardly stand it.</description>

      <description>Thinking of the celeb imbalance between the dems and GOP, the Republicans have produced President Ronald Reagan, Congressmen Steve Largeant, Sonny Bono, and JC Watts, Senator Fred Thompson, and Governor Ronald Reagan, Mayor Clint Eastwood.
Can anyone think of a significant celebrity Democrat office holder?  </description>

      <description>Ah hah! I&amp;rsquo;ve found some references from 2000. I was right: the media treated the Gore campaign much as they are now treating Kerry&amp;rsquo;s.
USA Today July 26, 2000:
 [T]he contrast with Texas Gov. Bush could hardly be sharper. From the beginning, Bush has relied on a hometown trio: chief strategist Karl Rove, campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and communications director Karen Hughes. Despite little experience in presidential campaigns, they have moved through this year&amp;rsquo;s difficult GOP primaries and into the general election winning credit, by and large, for being sure-footed and tight-lipped.</description>

      <description>Howard Fineman used his blog to spin for Kerry today. If I had any money, I&amp;rsquo;d offer a reward to the first person to find this quote pertaining to Al Gore. Speaking of Kerry, Fineman writes:
   &amp;ldquo;He is fundamentally a loner and a thoughtful decision-maker &amp;ndash;sometimes too much so, which the Bush campaign translates as &amp;ldquo;uncertainty.&amp;rdquo; &amp;quot;
 Isn&amp;rsquo;t that EXACTLY what they said was wrong with Gore?</description>

      <description>Wow. What an airhead. I hope I don&amp;rsquo;t offend any lawyer friends, but Edwards strikes me as the worst of his breed: ambulance chasers. I&amp;rsquo;ll be he has more books on marketing legal services, maximizing profitability from a single client, and finding new avenues for class action suits than he has on actual law.
John Edwards is a shallow, empty man who, absent our current legal system, would sell junk bonds door to door making millions without a scrupple.</description>

      <description>I thought I was the only one who distrusts John McCain. (I have not trusted him since his attacks on Pat Buchanan in which McCain knowingly advanced phony charges that Buchanan was a Nazi sympathizer. McCain did so for his own purposes and permanently destroy my faith in his character.)
Apparently, though, there are quite a few people who have reservations about the one of the Keating Five who never seems to get a mention with that group.</description>

      <description>Turmoil in the Kerry campaign continues to get attention: me, Dan Rather, Howard Fineman, Al Hunt, and now PoliBlogger.
Links to other stories available here, here, and here 
Again, I&amp;rsquo;m amazed at the similarities between descriptions of Kerry&amp;rsquo;s campaign problems and Al Gore&amp;rsquo;s four years ago. I&amp;rsquo;m sure Al Hunt and Howard Fineman mean to help Kerry with their fond descriptions of his thinking skills, but they are setting him up for failure by raising the bar too high.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 35 days nine hours since my last smoke, and I&amp;rsquo;m craving them badly today. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to smoke in over 2 weeks.
I&amp;rsquo;ve saved $232.75, though, less about $95 for off-brand patches. I have to buy one more box of 7 mg patches, then I&amp;rsquo;m done. I&amp;rsquo;ll have a net savings of about $130 by the time my patches run out. Wahoo!  </description>

      <description>Andrew Sullivan is sensing something that I&amp;rsquo;m sensing, too: things are moving, at least at the moment, in the President&amp;rsquo;s direction. I think the protesters are helping Bush far more than they&amp;rsquo;re hurting them, and Andrew has some other reasons:
   &amp;ldquo;In all this, you can almost feel the election swinging Bush&amp;rsquo;s way a little. The swift boat smear was important in jolting the conversation, in changing the dynamic that was pointing to a Bush defeat.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Dan Rather wrote on his blog that Democrats are becoming frustrated and disappointed with the Kerry campaign. As I noted earlier, there&amp;rsquo;s a feeling of a big Bush surge coming.
Now, Al Hunt, in today&amp;rsquo;s Wall Street Journal, writes of a &amp;ldquo;major shake-up&amp;rdquo; coming in the Kerry campaign. (Remember all of Al Gore&amp;rsquo;s shake-ups? Remember the contrast between Bush&amp;rsquo;s well-oiled machine with one man making quick decisions against Gore&amp;rsquo;s committee-driven, poll watching, risk averse blob?</description>

At 8 lbs., 4 oz. and 22 inches long, Al, as Moore has named him, is the largest of Moore&amp;rsquo;s many chins.

      <description>I agree with Richard Brookhiser that second terms are, more or less, pathetic disappointments. After four of the most tumultuous years of my life (and I lived through Kennedy&amp;rsquo;s assassination, Viet Nam, the horrid sixties, Nixon&amp;rsquo;s wage and price controls, Ford&amp;rsquo;s WIN buttons, Carter&amp;rsquo;s malaise, and Clinton&amp;rsquo;s intern training program, I think I&amp;rsquo;m ready for a dull four years of military victory, peace, and economic growth.
President Bush offers the best chance of those things coming true.</description>

      <description>Obviously, the taking of hostages is despicable, but we who have shouldered the responsibility of keeping the world safe for democracy for a century must think &amp;ldquo;how does it feel?&amp;rdquo; when we read this news.
The combination of rampant politically correct anit-religiosity with paranoid fear of self-defense has resulting in two French journalists in the hands of hostages who demand that France repeal its ban on Muslim headcovers.

      <description>The most pro-violent, anti-American, anti-Western protests since the 1970s has begun in New York. The protesters are there to wish death to the President of the United States and all support or tolerate him. Yet protesters, whose web pages and speeches are filled with violent, murderous mayhem, won&amp;rsquo;t do the deed themselves. While talking a good game, these unemployed, over-educated, unbathed, nasty excuses for human beings are, in fact, cowards. They confront their enemies only in large numbers and with the protection of police, whom they claim to despise.</description>

Sen. John McCain, the man who seems to make a living of getting hoodwinked by Democrats, now wants the 527 outlawed.</description>

      <description>This letter, published in NRO, is from an officer who was onboard the swiftboat the night of December 2-3, 1968 when Kerry claims to have been wounded under fire.
This letter is significant because Kerry&amp;rsquo;s defenders have claimed since the outset that none of the SwiftVets ever served onboard Kerry&amp;rsquo;s boat. The author of this letter was the Officer in Charge of the swiftboat that night&amp;ndash;Kerry&amp;rsquo;s senior officer who would have had to have signed the award recommendation.</description>

      <description>I have never studied linguistics, and the fact that Noam Chomsky made it his career before he set out to destroy Western Civilization, pretty much guarantees that I never will study it. But I think I have a sense of language and its effect on people. I pay attention to the evolution of words&amp;rsquo; meanings. I like the way words affect the human mind and emotions. I like metaphor and simile and hyperbole&amp;ndash;not to be clever, but to actually color a reader&amp;rsquo;s mood the way tiny drop of dye colors an entire bucket of milk.</description>

      <description>A herd of &amp;ldquo;scientists&amp;rdquo; recently gathered in Sweden to announce a new geological era, Anthropocene, which is man&amp;rsquo;s final destruction of the rest of the planet. These assembled idiots, embarrassments to whatever colleges granted them degrees, gave as an example of &amp;ldquo;catastophic&amp;rdquo; changes caused by man, sand churned up by SUVs and ATVs. Yes, dust churned up in the Sahara.
Of course, these mice of science lack any actual numbers. Were they to study their own fields, they&amp;rsquo;d learn that the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 released approxomately 11 cubic miles of dust into the atmosphere, creating a mini-nuclear winter in New York, some 6,000 miles away.</description>

Global warming is a theory, Dave, but dumping raw sewage into public water systems is proven to sicken people, fish, and water fowl.

      <description>The IOC, Greece, and NATO spent three years putting up defenses to keep terrorists away from the Olympic games. Now, the games are plagued with terrible attendance. So I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if maybe the people who normally go to Olympics are terrorists who couldn&amp;rsquo;t get into Greece for the 2004 games, therefore all the people disguised as empty seats.

      <description>I just took a quick trip through some lefty apparel and gift web sites. Wow. These people are bitter. Stammering.
They have these t-shirts with, three or four different themes on them. They&amp;rsquo;re all college co-ed hysterical stuff: &amp;ldquo;You know, Bush is going to get us all killed because that he can be like king and stuff,&amp;rdquo; on the front, and &amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re one of those military guys, you&amp;rsquo;re doing the work of evil .</description>

      <description>Jim Lacey, in National Review Online, makes some excellent points about the same thing I&amp;rsquo;ve wondered for some time: where are all the terrorists?
After we invaded Afghanistan, we were told that tens of thousands of well-trained fanatics were scattered around the globe, increasing their danger and allowing them to recruit more members.
Well, three years later, where are they? Why haven&amp;rsquo;t they struck?
Mr. Lacey&amp;rsquo;s article is well worth reading as explores some possible answers to these questions.</description>

      <description>And don&amp;rsquo;t even think about lecturing me about veterans. I&amp;rsquo;m one, too, though not from Vietnam era. Peter is, and his letter to Kerry is an important read.
   It&amp;rsquo;s bad enough that we couldn&amp;rsquo;t mourn our dead then. Now we see the same man that stood over the open graves of our brothers and pissed on their bodies is back. This time he&amp;rsquo;s dug up those bodies and is standing on them to give himself the stature for high office.</description>

He takes a job from President Bush, then libels him in a disgusting display.

      <description>Letter to John Kerry
August 25, 2004
Senator John Kerry
304 Russell Senate Office Building
Washington, DC 20510
Dear Senator Kerry,
We are pleased to welcome your campaign representatives to Texas today. We honor all our veterans, all whom have worn the uniform and served our country. We also honor the military and National Guard troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan today. We are very proud of all of them and believe they deserve our full support.</description>

      <description>Everyone knows that John F. Kerry refuses to allow anyone to view any part of his official military records. The Truth Laid Bear blog has found another Kerry cover-up: his contributors list.
Even though federal election law requires that candidates for all public office publicize their contributor list and how much each contributor gives, Kerry considers himself above the law. Bush, whose military records are public record, lists almost 100% of his contributors, while Kerry&amp;rsquo;s disclosure rate is in the mere 70s.</description>

A logical person&amp;ndash;a professor of philosophy, let&amp;rsquo;s say, or math&amp;ndash;mush cringe trying to defend Kerry&amp;rsquo;s arguments that his service in Vietnam makes him more deserving of the office of the President of the United States than its current occupant. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:
Kerry and most Democrats consider the US to be the bad guys in Vietnam, and the US military the perpetrators of wrong for the advance of evil.</description>

      <description>Oil output is up and demand is down. The reasonable price for oil is about $35.00/bbl. based on historic supply and demand balances. But reason has been thrown to the wind by a combination of pessimism, panic, stupidity, and hardy greed. The best way to punish the stupid and mean is to greatly reduce consumption. Here&amp;rsquo;s some easy ways.
  Tax-free days for telecommuting. Absolve employers of all payroll tax burdens on a day-for-day basis for employees who work from home.</description>

      <description>Just when I was ready to hand the election to Kerry thanks to the SwiftVets, the DNC makes me look stupid. I had no idea that they would do something as stupid as waste an entire Sunday trying to convince people that George W. Bush ghost-wrote the SwiftVets book, but that&amp;rsquo;s just what they did.
Stupid, stupid Democrats. You were winning this one, you morons! Instead of being &amp;ldquo;presidential&amp;rdquo; and adult about it by having Kerry merely respond, &amp;ldquo;My record in the Navy is my record in the Navy,&amp;rdquo; you send out drooling attack dogs like Tad Divine to lie about Bush&amp;rsquo;s personal involvement.</description>

      <description>A powerful union allowed to run amok in the St. Louis area&amp;rsquo;s fire protection district has made a lot of firefighters rich. It&amp;rsquo;s a little frustrating that the firemen in the safest districts seem to make the most money. It&amp;rsquo;s more alarming that a district that was better paid than any area union district unionized last year. That will only drive up the cost of fire protection for everyone. As with so many unions, expect this story in the St.</description>

      <description>The swift boat veterans who penned the anti-Kerry book have accomplished two things: made themselves look petty and made John Kerry look strong.
Hey, amateur politicians: Never give your opponent the opportunity to take a stand in defense of himself, his family, or his military service.
Kerry got no bounce from the DNC convention, but he will get 10 points from the swiftvets by this time next week. Bush will be down 12 when the GOP convention begins thanks to amateur political hacks who thought they could help their candidate.</description>

With the GOP convention around the corner, Kerry&amp;rsquo;s bounce (or whatever he got from the DNC convention) is gone&amp;ndash;Bush and Kerry are dead even. Reagan was only slightly ahead of Mondale at this point in 1984, when Mary Lou became the first American to win the Olympic all-around.</description>

Ted Rall is a liar who lies to promote his personal goal of inciting a violent overthrow of the United States government so he and George Soros can impose a Stalinist state. They are, after all, working communists committed to fulfilling Lenin&amp;rsquo;s dream.
But that&amp;rsquo;s just my opinion, as Dennis Miller days; I could be wrong.   </description>

      <description>Okay, this is simple enough for even John Kerry and Howard Dean supporters to understand: American service members are safer serving in Iraq than they are in the US.
The US mortality rate, according to the Centers for Disease Control, is 834 deaths per 100,000 of population per year. There have been 200,000 (average) US troops in Iraq for 18 months. The death rate for 200,000 Americans should be 1,668 per year, meaning that since the start of the war, statistically you&amp;rsquo;d expect 2,502 Americans to have died.</description>

 What goes into the site? What main tabs? What sub tabs? What security roles? What can each security role see and do?  In other words, basic site design and flow.
In almost every site I&amp;rsquo;ve designed, I&amp;rsquo;ve begun down the wrong path. I don&amp;rsquo;t get far, mind you, but I always start off the wrong way.</description>

Most people understand this conceptually, but we haven&amp;rsquo;t had any hard proof. Until now.
Since last Saturday when Tom Ridge held a press conference to announce that 5 specific building and other unspecified buildings were targets of on-going Qaeda planning, the liberals herein mentioned, plus their Amen Corner in every city coffee shop and faculty lounge in the county, accused the Bush administration of fabricating the evidence in order to boost the President&amp;rsquo;s poll ratings.</description>

Whatever funding the Bush Administration hasn&amp;rsquo;t cut off from terrorists will now be redirected to the Kerry campaign. Either way, the terrorists lose their money.

      <description>Why beat around the bush, so to speak. If you think the Administration invented the terror alert for 5 buildings in order to boost the President&amp;rsquo;s re-election chances, you are un-American.
Should terrorism strike between now and the election, they will either claim that the GOP coordinated the attack (no doubt designed to kill Democrats in key voting districts), or blame the Administration for failing to protect us. The media will oblige them&amp;ndash;on both counts.</description>

      <description>Okay, I know I&amp;rsquo;m risking looking like an idiot, but I&amp;rsquo;ll predict (with 16% of the precincts reporting) that Claire McCaskill will win the Democrat Gubernatorial primary in Missouri, defeating a failed, one-term governor who won primarily because his predecessor died a month before the election.
Bob Holden was a disaster as governor. He was outwitted by the Republican House Speaker at every turn. He seemed petty and unprepared for the office.</description>

      <description>You have selected the better candidate for governor. Why does a Republican care? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m also a Missourian. I must remind myself: What if the Democrat wins? On the chance that the next Missouri governor is a Democrat, I have to side with the best Democrat available. That may not be Claire McKaskill, but it sure as hell isn&amp;rsquo;t Bob Holden.
Whoever wins the general election, Missouri&amp;rsquo;s next governor will be better than its current one.</description>

      <description>Howard Dean claims that the White House made up the threat against NY and DC financial institutions in order to win votes. Howard Dean had all of the money, all of the liberal pundits, all of the liberal media, and all of the DNC on his side going into Iowa. His message earned him not a single delegate until the Vermont primary, where he won 18 votes to 14.
Howard Dean is a stupid man.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The policies of this administration, I believe and others believe very deeply, have resulted in an increase of animosity and anger focused on the United States of America,&amp;rdquo; Kerry told reporters after a campaign meeting with first responders. &amp;ldquo;The people who are training terror are using our actions as a means of recruitment.&amp;rdquo;
Of course, they&amp;rsquo;re pissed at us, Senator. We drove them out of Afghanistan. We dried up their money supplies around the world.</description>

      <description>Well, I was being facetious in my earlier post about Kerry suggesting we simply surrender to Al Qaeda. But, once again, no matter how ridiculous a conservative tries to be, he can&amp;rsquo;t top the way liberals really think.
John Kerry truly believes we should never had launched a war on terrorism. He&amp;rsquo;s not backing down on that stand.
Good for him: it&amp;rsquo;s likely to be his last.   </description>

      <description>John Kerry is mocking Bush&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Turning the Corner&amp;rdquo; campaign theme.
&amp;ldquo;I think the American people are a heck of a lot smarter than some of these politicians and political consultants think they are,&amp;rdquo; Kerry told a recent, all-Democrat audience.
Mr. Kerry failed to tell them that he thinks Americans are too stupid to save for their own retirement, to decide how much to spend on medical care, to decide which cars to drive, to decide where to live, to decide where to send their children to school.</description>

      <description>Last night was a big test. I passed, but there were a few anxious moments.
I took Angela to dinner at a fairly new, popular restaurant in Lafayette Square. Eleven Eleven Mississippi is modeled off of Northern California&amp;rsquo;s wine country bistros. It&amp;rsquo;s menu is excellent. It&amp;rsquo;s wine selection perfect. It&amp;rsquo;s prices reasonable.
This was the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve been &amp;ldquo;out&amp;rdquo; since quitting. My first smoke pangs occured just as we finished dinner.</description>

      <description>A union is trying to organize Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s programmers. The union is exploiting fear of off shoring to rally the workers.
Having worked in software engineering for a decade, but observed the utility of unions over 40 years, I strongly urge Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s employees to do some long, hard thinking before they sign up with the labor group.
Unions have been completely unable to stop off shoring in every industry they&amp;rsquo;ve tried. In fact, in steel, garments, and shoes, union activity accelerated the rates of job moves to overseas companies by making American workers more of a headache and more expensive.</description>

      <description>It would appear that the insurgency in Iraq heeded Southwest Airlines&amp;rsquo; marketing campaign: &amp;ldquo;You are now free to move about the country.&amp;rdquo; Having captured, in broad daylight, the head of an Iraqi construction company, the insurgents have sent the clear signal to the Iraqi people, &amp;ldquo;We are in charge.&amp;rdquo;
The United States had an opportunity to destroy the resistance in April, May, and June of 2003. Instead, we chose to let them take their AK-47s and RPGs home to regroup, plot, and recruit.</description>

      <description>Bill&amp;rsquo;s comments move me to tears. Not having been on the stage since childhood (&amp;ldquo;Smallest Princess&amp;rdquo;, The King and I), I cannot speak to that, but I can try to describe the width and breadth of my pride in having been in on the labor and birth of such an awesome production. I am, by nature, a major busy body. I love watching all the parts of a show come together&amp;ndash; the sets building and painting, the designing and sewing, the planning and buying, the blocking and practicing&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Make-up, lights, set, rehearsal, house: stage. Words that convey things to those with theatre in their blood and things very different to the rest of the world.
Friday night before the curtain felt like an opening. I was nervous. I thought back to my first play at DB: Blythe Spirit. In my first scene my character sipped a martini. On opening night, I was so nervous that the water&amp;rsquo;s surface looked like what I what later see from the bridge of a submarine: rolling waves breaking into white caps.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I started crying.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I saw how much you love being on stage, and I was overwhelmed by how good this show is . . . and how good you are. I was just . . . I was afraid I&amp;rsquo;d started gasping.&amp;rdquo;
That&amp;rsquo;s the effect you had on my wife opening night.
She&amp;rsquo;s not just a biased family member in the audience. She&amp;rsquo;s an accomplished dancer and theatre major who&amp;rsquo;s seen more than her share of plays.</description>

      <description>23 years ago, I met Joe DiMercurio at auditions for his People&amp;rsquo;s Players production of Sound of Music. Over the next four years, he became one of my closest friends, particularly on stage.
Last night, after the thrill of a wonderful opering night, still buzzing from the excitement and the energy of the play, I found out that my haste in producing the program resulted in my omitting one of my best friend&amp;rsquo;s biography.</description>

      <description>So, last night was Opening Night&amp;hellip;
I personally thought it went GREAT! The audience was very receptive&amp;ndash;laughing and clapping when and where they should have. (And not being shy about it.) I THINK this is accurate information, but I heard that we started a few minutes late because we still had a line out the door for tickets at 7:30. (?) And that, save for 9 tickets, we were sold out (?</description>

      <description>One seminal moment can so focus the mind that the thing that should be central slides to the periphery.
Mr. L surprised me with &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s say a prayer.&amp;rdquo;
Instantly, I remembered the routine practiced by every Catholic sports team, speech club, and theatre cast and crew before any important event: hands lain upon hand, bodies pressed against bodies, some stretching to reach, others bowing to accommodate. All together for one moment, humbly before God and man, asking for His blessing on what we are about to do.</description>

      <description>I personally felt that final tech did exactly what I thought it would do&amp;ndash;everything came together. Sure, there were a few final snags to be ironed out, many notes taken by Mr. L, but that&amp;rsquo;s just standard procedure. Commenting on Bill&amp;rsquo;s blog, when I heard &amp;ldquo;Bust your buns&amp;rdquo;, it had been wayyyy too long since I heard that before a show. Before every community theatre show I&amp;rsquo;ve done though, I have found a quiet secluded spot for myself, and I have prayed and recited that &amp;lsquo;pre-game&amp;rsquo; ritual that I prayed and recited before every show I was in or worked on at DuBourg.</description>

I was looking around last night at everyone in their full costumes, make-up, wigs, hair, etc. and it was just amazing&amp;ndash;everything and everyone looks so fun and awesome!
I do have to admit, though, I am starting to freak out a little bit. I mean, I know everything will come together by Wednesday night&amp;ndash;as it always has&amp;ndash;but I still get paranoid before a show.</description>

Today, we make history. We use the Green Room for the first time. My Guild training paid off when I was in college. When I first saw the big green room below the stage at Fontbonne, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to be able to sit and relax between scenes. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it. I was so used to being in the wings when not on, I was afraid that I&amp;rsquo;d &amp;ldquo;lose&amp;rdquo; something being in a bright, comfortable, climate-controlled room, listening to the play over crackling speakers.</description>

Last night on CNN&amp;rsquo;s Larry King Live, Kerry had this exchange (from Drudge):

&amp;ldquo;And we have better hair. And that goes a long way.&amp;rdquo;
Perhaps if the Senator wishes us to take him seriously as a presidential candidate, he should put down the mirror, stop kissing his VP nominee, and attend the terror assessment briefings offered by the White House.</description>

Almost immediately, evil bastards in the DNC and their minions in the press began a whipering campaign that Ridge was making up these reports in order draw attention away from John Kerry&amp;rsquo;s campaign.</description>

We worked and re-worked that d*mn thing soo many times, but it helped sooo much!

Sitting on the floor, watching the others work, hearing Jim breathe a deeper, more coordinated life into characters, was a beautiful thing to observe. While we all know OUR motivations and worries, the director&amp;rsquo;s vision is the one that counts&amp;ndash;it turns isolated characters into related beings.</description>

      <description>I wrote last week that it is refreshing to know that one person in Washington can tell his political enemy to fuck himself and not feel obliged to apologize to generations yet unborn for action. Now, Anna Quindlen, in the latest Newsweek online, has wrung her hands beyond the poor abilities of Madge in a Palmolive commercial to repair.
Quindlen is worried that these Republicans are too damn manly for the good of the country.</description>

      <description>The New Republic claims that the Bush Administration has ordered the government of Pakistan to capture Usama bin Laden and other major terrorism and Taliban fugitives during the DNC convention in July.
This magazine, which I have long respected and often hated, has now made itself fit to stand beside The National Enquirer and the World News. Next, we&amp;rsquo;ll learn about the traumatic childhood of a half-man, half-pig adolescent living in Georgia and that the Virgin Mary works as a cocktail waitress in the lounge at the Holiday Inn in Meridian, Mississippi.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there&amp;rsquo;s a name for people who believe only the worst about everything, but there should be. And the word should hint at the irony that these kinds of people are also the kinds of people who promote hatred, mistrust, and murder in the name of human rights, fairness, peace, and justice.
Oh. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. There is a name for them; they&amp;rsquo;re called liberals.
The liberals have a little fiction mag called CounterPunch.</description>

      <description>Drudge and Bloomberg got it. The Wall Street Journal, MSNBC, CNN, all hid it. FoxNews.com buried it below the fold. What is it?
US Jobless Claims Fall to Lowest Level Since 2000
There number of new claims for unemployment benefits fell, last week, by 39,000 to a four-year low. Yet all of the liberal media buried the story. Why? Because good economic news hurts Kerry&amp;rsquo;s chances of election, and the primary goal of the major news media in the US is to get him elected.</description>

      <description>Tom Ridge&amp;rsquo;s announcment, today, that Al Qaeda intends to launch a major hit on the US to alter the outcome of our November elections should be a wake up call to all the people, like Michael Moore, who think that Bush is the moral inferior to UBL.
I hope we have more spine than Spain. I hope the attack, should it materialize, will galvanize America&amp;rsquo;s resolve to carry the Bush Doctraine to it&amp;rsquo;s limits.</description>

      <description>Well tonight is the last &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; rehearsal for Pippin&amp;hellip;I have a feeling it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a long one. Not a big deal, though; I&amp;rsquo;m used to it.
At the risk of sounding sappy, sentimental, etc. (which really is NOT me at all&amp;ndash;maybe deep down, but not a side I generally show to lots of people.), I need to explain some things:
First, I used to be shy. No, seriously, I was.</description>

      <description>Tuesday night, I stood backstage, waiting for The Finale to begin. Susan and Bob were saying final goodbyes on stage as Pippin and Catherine. I was alone. Suddenly, as if an angel had tapped my shoulder, I was awakened into a dream of my wife.
Until rehearsals began, we spent so much time together. We rarely go out, nor do we entertain a lot. With five kids, those things are just out of the question.</description>

      <description>Poor Dr. Sami Solanki. He and his colleagues at the Institute for Astronomy in Zurich have discovered that sun spot activity&amp;ndash;which has been measured since 1610 and can be reliable tracked for a thousand years before that&amp;ndash;has a powerful influence on the earth&amp;rsquo;s temperatures.
Moreover, the sun, they&amp;rsquo;ve found, has been more active in the past 60 years&amp;ndash;which coincides with &amp;ldquo;global warming&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;than any time in the past 1,000 years.
Wait until the environmentalist whackos go after this poor bastard.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve come here in the past few days, you&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that my site&amp;rsquo;s been down. There are a couple of reasons:
  I spent 24 out of 38 hours working in my family room (and, no, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Godfather maration). I painted, ripped out the carpet, and put in laminate flooring that looks wonderful. In the process, I re-routed some cables and forget to reconnect them until Monday morning.</description>

Thus spake al Qaeda through two Arabic web sites. The date is July 15. The truce was to give European nations time to pull all troops out of Muslim countries, presumably Afghanistan included.
How will Europe respond? Why not America?
Al Qaeda should that it still has the capability to strike in Europe by the train in Spain bombing that changed that country&amp;rsquo;s government and policy.</description>

      <description>Newsweek, via MSNBC, has a story about the &amp;ldquo;famine&amp;rdquo; in Sudan. What the f*ck? When Muslim extremists murder scores, burn villages, block food relief, burn crops, and lay waste to an entire country, it&amp;rsquo;s not A GODDAMN FAMINE! It&amp;rsquo;s murder, genocide, evil-incarnate. It&amp;rsquo;s a spineless, greedy, UN chief taking money under the table to keep his mouth shut, as he did with Saddam. It&amp;rsquo;s a horror and disgrace to a world that considers itself &amp;ldquo;civlized.</description>

      <description>The stories, the facts, the meat of the case, against the United Nations are beginning to leak out. Here is one such story from the New York Post.
Saddam used bribes to UN Officials to divert $10 billion from food and medicine for the Iraqi people to building palaces and killing people he didn&amp;rsquo;t like. The UN quietly endorsed this practice.
Giving money to UN relief agencies is more than a waste: it&amp;rsquo;s supporting corruption that kills innocent people.</description>

      <description>The good news is that the economy added 112,000 new jobs in June. The bad news is that that figure is less than half of what economists expected. More bad: manufacturing lost jobs.
Personally, I was stunned by the news. The month when kids get out of school for the summer, resorts increase staff for vacation season, etc., should have seen a big number. I was siding with the more optimistic economists expecting 300,000+ new jobs.</description>

Is it any surprise, really? I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed the press handling things this way for some time: First, put out a story that is mostly false by using some legitimate source&amp;rsquo;s name without really revealing what that source said. Let the story (that reinforces the press&amp;rsquo;s prejudices) fester for awhile. Finally, to maintian their own legitimacy, quietly leak the real story. That way, editors can tell Tim Russert or Marvin Kalb, &amp;ldquo;We published the entirety of the commission&amp;rsquo;s finding.</description>

Hat tip to Professor Bainbridge.
Too many Christians rely on the writings of modern scholars who, 200 years from now, may or may not be valid. We just don&amp;rsquo;t know. We do know, however, that Augustine and Aquinas remain valid. Trust the ancients for they have withstood the test of time.   </description>

      <description>Iraq&amp;rsquo;s population is about 25 million. It&amp;rsquo;s 2004 death rate is 5.66 deaths per 1,000. The US population is more than 10 times that at just under 300 million. Our death rate is 8.34 per 1,000.
Before you go crying about all the people we are killing in Iraq, bear in mind that your chances of dying in 2004 are much, much greater here than there. Iraq is obviously safer than the United States.</description>

But the attitudes of my fellow Americans, led by the cowardly liar Michael Moore (please sue me) has hardened my opinion of my neighbors. My guess is that this evening&amp;rsquo;s talk shows will host more than a few &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; pundits who will claim Saddam&amp;rsquo;s indictment of Bush proves Moore&amp;rsquo;s case&amp;ndash;that Bush is in fact a criminal.</description>

This is the best proof in a long time that we were morally right to liberate Iraq.

Maureen Dowd must be a joy. I hope I never meet her. Virtually the whole her being now works toward displaying her visceral hatred for George Bush and for anyone who would vote for him.</description>

Bet you won&amp;rsquo;t hear it on television news, though. So read the source.
RUMSFELD:
   Now what&amp;rsquo;s actually happened? Right now you have the Iraqi Survey Group, which is a multinational group that&amp;rsquo;s out there reviewing documentation and looking at suspect WMD sites.

      <description>Even as gasoline prices continue to fall, I am furious about the synchronization of traffic signals in my part of the world.
Once upon a time, municipalities synchronized traffic signals so that a vehicle moving at or about the speed limit would be stopped by a red light very infrequently, usually once while on that particular road. Apparently, St. Louis County, Missouri has abandoned that practice.
Last night, I had to stop for 7 of 9 signals in a 4 mile stretch approaching my home.</description>

      <description>Yeah, we were all on pins and needles, weren&amp;rsquo;t we? Speaking in San Francisco, CA, the New York Senator affirmed the most basic belief of liberalism: educated elites know better what&amp;rsquo;s good for you than you do, and they will use the full power of the US government to force you to comply with their plans.
&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good,&amp;rdquo; she said.</description>

      <description>Do you get the feeling that something&amp;ndash;really big&amp;ndash;is about to happen?
I do. Something tells me it will be something good and big. Capture bin Laden? Maybe, but I think that would be anticlimactic at this point. As the 9/11 Commission reported June 6, the US war on terror has all but crippled Al Qaeda&amp;rsquo;s abilitiy to do something big and bad. They are reduced to killing hapless innocents abroad one at a time with a knife.</description>

      <description>The 9th Circuit&amp;rsquo;s ruling held that the federal marijuana laws did not apply to medicinal use of marijuana in two specific cases. As you should know, the Constitution prohibits Congress from making laws on matters that lie outside its enumerated powers, which are very limited. One of those powers, though, known as the commerce clause, gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. The commerce clause has become the conduit for Congressional abuse of the states and of the people.</description>

      <description>Econopundit  is reporting, from a source listening to Iraqi radio, that Iraqi intelligence has captured terrorist Al-Zarqawi. If so, mark June 27 as the turning point in the Iraqi operation: the second deadliest terrorist in the world captured, and a democracy in the Middle East. Not to mention NATO capitulation to Bush and Blair and limited victories for the administration handling of Gitmo detainees from the Supremes.   </description>

      <description>In a move designed to shock the American press and Iraqi terrorists, the new Iraqi government took sovereign control of that country this morning in a low-key ceremony in Baghdad. The US, British, Polish, Turkish, Czech, South Korean, Japanese, and other troops are now guests of the interim government.
Just months ago, critics claimed that June 30 was a ridiculous date, that the Iraqis, being dark-skinned people who don&amp;rsquo;t speak English natively, would never be able to handle the responsibilities of self-governance with so little preparation.</description>

      <description>According to CNN.com: 
The United States has formally resumed diplomatic ties with Libya after a 24-year break, the State Department says.
Oh, if only the al-Zarqawi story were true. Imagine, since taking office, George Bush&amp;rsquo;s State Department has overthrown Saddam and freed 25 million Iraqi prisoners, overthrown the Taliban and freed 25 million Afghan slaves, disarmed and normalized relations with Libya, and, so far, prevented a single act of terrorism on United States soil or against significant US interests since 9/11/01.</description>

      <description>St. Louis &amp;ndash; When someone says &amp;ldquo;the President,&amp;rdquo; I still think the reference is to Ronald Reagan. As JFK did for Bill Clinton and his generation, and as FDR did for my mom and dad, Ronald Reagan defined the presidency for me. He was my president. He is my hero.
Having just moved to St. Louis from Groton, Connecticut (fleeing taxes, among other reasons), I was busy this afternoon moving furniture from our bedroom to the basement of our house, which is just four years younger than our 40th president.</description>

      <description>And comes away disappointed. In his review of Fahrenheit 9/11, Christopher Hitchens explains his longtime craving for liberal version of Firing Line (William F. Buckley&amp;rsquo;s long running discussion show on CBS and PBS), or even a liberal Rush Limbaugh. He hoped it would be Michael Moore.
Then he saw the movie:
   To describe this film as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability.</description>

I have no pity for the Iraqis killed by American bombers that took out a terrorist safe house. I pity the children whose criminal parents placed them in harms way, but no one else. (In case you believe the locals who said it was an innocent family home, weapons and bombs that were cached in the house exploded for 20 minutes after the US attack was over.</description>

      <description>What can you learn from a serial killer? It&amp;rsquo;s up to you, but David Berkowitz&amp;rsquo;s musings are worth reading.
I was in grade school when the Son of Sam murders captivated the country&amp;rsquo;s imagination. It was an odd time in my life. Saturday Night Live was the most talked about television show. America, by and large, had decided to put Watergate and Vietnam onto the backburner. We were ready to laugh.</description>

For one week, we took the full measure of a great man who lived in our lifetimes: a man who strode across history&amp;rsquo;s plane with steps that challenged, but didn&amp;rsquo;t surpass, the founders. We needed to cry, to laugh, to reflect on a life well-lived. And we did.</description>

      <description>Reading reminders of the hatred for Ronald Reagan (now the most beloved former president in US history), offers a lesson for President Bush and the American people.
During his administration, Reagan repeatedly did what he felt was right or necessary at the expense of his personal and political popularity. He was truly hated in Europe and in American institutions of higher learning. Yet his confident and brave pursuit of good won both the political and the moral battles of the time and of history.</description>

      <description>A foul and acrid odor greets the nose
and violates the shirt, the pant, the underwear
for hours, days, weeks, unwashed.
Plastic flip-top lid conceals
the quartered fruit, so dry
and old, unworthy of gin or tongue.
Tired, sad, bilirubin-stained faces
surround the parallelogram
giving more than they receive
and much less than they asked for.
Age marked in hollows, dents, and chips.
Laughters, hard and coarse, rise above
the jukebox boom of same old songs</description>

      <description>Julia Smillie wonders if technology and blogging has doomed writers.
 Mediocre writing always had a following, even though it didn&amp;rsquo;t transcend eras. Good writing still sells and IS read, while bad writing sells and sits. When I first started trying to get published in the 1980s, I read The Writer and Writer&amp;rsquo;s Digest religiously. Almost every issue contained at least one column or article that said this exact same thing.</description>

      <description>I recently had an experience with a social services agency that paints an unfriedly face for the organization.
Almost Home, run by the Franciscan Sisters of St. Mary, provides teen mothers with the chance to make a better life for themselves and their children. In exchange for going to school, remaining free from drugs, establishing the norms of social achievement (job, daycare, financial assistance, child-rearing skills, etc.), the women and their babies have a safe, comfortable place to live, help with their children, etc.</description>

      <description>Why can they not even send a simple acknowledgement? Don&amp;rsquo;t they realize that a woman with a college degree wants to take a pay cut to work a nasty job helping society&amp;rsquo;s most vulnerable people, it&amp;rsquo;s a compliment? I even sent Target gift cards to the center so some of the young women could buy small gifts for their kids, or something for themselves.
The response from Almost Home&amp;rsquo;s communication director was shockingly cold, impersonal, and sarcastic:</description>

      <description>With that, the guards silently beckoned me to turn. The room was large and dark. Overhead lights illuminated the oracle on her seat and spilled onto the guards, but the rest of the room was invisible. Before me lay large double doors. I could see light fighting to enter around the great doors&amp;rsquo; edges. As I walked toward the light, the doors began to open slowly, admitting more light. I could see that pottery and artifacts stood on display pedestals all around the room, whose charcoal gray ceiling stood at least forty feet above me.</description>

      <description>I must admit that I paid no attention the New Hampshire primary until about 15 minutes ago.
For those of you who are like me, Kerry won by more than 10 points over Dean. Edwards and Clark tied for third. (Is this Clark any relation to Ramsey Clark? And if not, why not?)
Howard Dean&amp;rsquo;s post coital speech sounded a lot like a farewell, according to the snippets I read. He named a lot of people who work(ed) on his campaign, thanking them for their long hours, [insert all the stock phrases here].</description>

I am very rarely critical of anything National Review and its people do, but I have to criticize this conversation: no one cares. The world view NR and her readers and advocates as conservatives. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t separate Buchanan from Goldberg. And we conservative, including those of us who formerly wrote for NR on CompuServe, couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less.</description>

      <description>Can anyone look upon the fading figure of John Kerry without feeling a sense of pity as for a man who&amp;rsquo;s lost his family and home? His serious face, always looking a bit pained with concern, now expresses a sad displeasure for life itself. To make matters worse, Howard Dean, the child politician &amp;ndash; childlike in size, bearing, countenance, temperament, mentality, and world view &amp;ndash; has not only stolen Kerry&amp;rsquo;s media-given title of Man to Beat, he has now taken Kerry&amp;rsquo;s Biblical allusion: Job.</description>

      <description>Even more bizarre, or so it must have seemed to Senator Kerry, was the effect of the war, for which he voted. The more successful our campaign in Iraq, the less his fellow Democrats liked him. Had we lost the war, one assumes that the rank-and-file Democrats would have supported a warmonger candidate. But as our victory became apparent, the Dems fled to the two candidates who opposed the war in the first place: Dean and Clark.</description>

Howard Dean potentially faces criminal charges for releasing secret security plans for the Yankee Nuclear Power plant after 9/11/01. He won&amp;rsquo;t release records of meetings from his 11 years as governor, but he&amp;rsquo;s pretty fast and loose with national security plans whose compromise could give terrorists the information they need to overcome that security.</description>

My questions to the NEA are * How much money would satisfy your insatiable greed?</description>

Keeping score, Dean is now a hypocrite on: * Dean wants the Bush administration to release minutes of meetings with energy executives, but he refuses to release minutes of his meetings with energy executives. * Dean wants religion divorced from politics, but he wants to talk about what a bang-up Christian he is while campaigning in the South.</description>

      <description>Hey, I think I was too quick to judge the Dean on Religion article in the Washington Post. I felt that the reporter, Jim VandeHei, was soft on Dean and failed to analyze or even characterize the veracity of the doctor&amp;rsquo;s statements on religion. Having re-read the article, I have a new perspective. (Hey, I&amp;rsquo;ve been celebrating the holidays, and the mind isn&amp;rsquo;t quite up to full speed.)
VandeHei has done a hatchet job to Dean.</description>

      <description>I found this on Drudge. I offer a contrarian explanation, however. Perhaps the feminization of men&amp;ndash;mandatorily sitting to urinate in pre-schools, supporting Howard Dean&amp;ndash;is reducing the amount of testosterone men produce. I&amp;rsquo;d like to see a study that measures the sperm count in deficient men before and after a weekend movie marathon of The Godfather I and II, Patton, Braveheart, The Patriot (Mel Gibson&amp;rsquo;s), and Band of Brothers (all 10 episodes).</description>

      <description>We know that Dean has a problem with his handling of security and safety failures at Vermont&amp;rsquo;s only nuclear power plant. Dean&amp;rsquo;s World has an excellent point.
Combine the Yankee Power/Homeland Security issue with Dr. Dean&amp;rsquo;s secret energy policy meetings, and you begin to see that money talks with the good doctor, as does he from both sides of his mouth.
Also, have you noticed that the big magazines, Time and Newsweek, are starting to question the Dean phenomenon?</description>

      <description>No, it&amp;rsquo;s not about football.
  Howard Dean isn&amp;rsquo;t an idiot, according to Andrew Sullivan. He&amp;rsquo;s a doctor, dictator, refuses to be challenged or questioned, has no peers, likes to tell people what to do, right or wrong, and let the patient suffer the consequences of his errors.

      <description>From the Washington Post:
 &amp;ldquo;I am still learning a lot about faith and the South and how important it is,&amp;rdquo; said Dean, a Congregationalist. The Congregationalist Church is a Christian denomination that preaches a personal relationship with God without a strong hierarchal structure guiding it. Dean was reared an Episcopalian, but left the church 25 years ago in a dispute with a local Vermont church over efforts to build a bike path.</description>

      <description>The Democrats have a real dilemma: Dean is seen by more and more people as both a shameless opportunist and a man who can&amp;rsquo;t speak straight. Making mistakes of fact at a pace of three a week, he runs the risk of looking significantly less intellectually vigorous than President Bush&amp;ndash;something most people thought unthinkable a few months ago. Is it any wonder that Kerry, Gephardt, and the rest of the Democrat field are scared of Dean?</description>

      <description>As governor of Vermont, Howard Dean repeatedly ignored warnings that his state was unprepared for a potential nuclear problem involving the Yankee Nuclear Power Plant and that security at the plant was unacceptable.
According to the Associated Press, Dean, who criticizes the Bush Administration&amp;rsquo;s war on terror nearly every day, underfunded critical programs to secure the nuclear plant even after September 11.
 &amp;ldquo;During Dean&amp;rsquo;s final year in office in 2002, an audit concluded that despite a decade of repeated warnings of poor safety at Vermont Yankee, Dean&amp;rsquo;s administration was poorly prepared for a nuclear disaster,&amp;rdquo; the AP story said</description>

750 words of analysis of the unfolding story about a Democrat senate conspiracy to subvert the federal judiciary, and my computer screwed you, dear reader, out of it.

 the President and senators so chosen will always be of the number of those who best understand our national interests, whether considered in relation to the several States or to foreign nations, who are best able to promote those interests, and whose reputation for integrity inspires and merits confidence.</description>

      <description>Deaniacs send money to the Dean campaign whenever there&amp;rsquo;s a negative story about their candidate. (The fact that this method raised $15 million in three months says something about Dean, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what.) I propose that readers donate $5.00 to this blog every time Dr. Dean says something stupid. The money will be used to improve the site, allow me more time to research and write, and, if Dean remains on the front pages until November, let me retire a wealthy man this time next year.</description>

I would add my own rebuttal to Dean&amp;rsquo;s comments, but between Kaus&amp;rsquo;s analysis and Dean&amp;rsquo;s own political stupidity and pathological carelessness, I really can&amp;rsquo;t make this any more damaging to the good doctor&amp;rsquo;s faultering reputation.

Manufacturing grew at its fastest pace in 20 years (since the Reagan administration) in December.
Hiring will pick up in 2004 according to economists, with unemployment dropping .5% to 5.5% by November (as per my 2004 Predictions).
Stock markets are up across the board, with Dow and NASDAQ safely above 10000 and 2000, respectively.</description>

      <description>Steve Moore of the Club for Growth has an excellent analysis of Howard Dean&amp;rsquo;s proposed tax increases. An excellent summary:
_The Dean plan, our ad notes, would raise taxes by $2,472 a year on a typical middle-income family of four. Mr. Dean would also raise the death tax rate, the capital gains tax rate, the dividend tax rate and the payroll tax, and he would bring back the hated marriage tax penalty that President Bush abolished this year.</description>

      <title>North Korea Allows US Inspectors</title>

      <description>When Town Hall was in its infancy on CompuServe, and I was writing three columns a week, Jimmy Carter&amp;rsquo;s illegal negotiations with North Korea that resulted in US assistance in building nuclear weapons to be aimed at Los Angeles and Chicago inspired my most vitriolic pieces. What bothered me, perhaps, more than anything was the fact that Carter&amp;rsquo;s meddling had me siding with Clinton. That was 1994.
Ten years later, we are still digging out from that mess.</description>

      <title>Will Deaniacs Vote?</title>

      <description>It is easy to get young people riled up, as William F. Buckely points out. The Dean house parties, rallies, $2 donations, etc., are the kinds of things young people like to do. And there is no doubt that Dean has energized a particular demographic group, namely, the 18- to 24-year-old folk.
Last week, Dr. Dean warned the DNC chairman that, if the other Democrat candidates don&amp;rsquo;t stop attacking Dean, Dean&amp;rsquo;s supporters might not vote at all come November 2004.</description>

      <description>The New Year begins with&amp;ndash;guess what&amp;ndash;Howard Dean saying something stupid. Thankfully, John F**ing Kerry has called him on it.
Dean&amp;rsquo;s inability to research his statements before making them&amp;ndash;like finding out how Kerry voted&amp;ndash;makes you wonder what kind of a doctor he was. Did he prescribe medication before checking the patient&amp;rsquo;s allergies? Did he prescribe procedures without determining if that procedure remained the recommended treatment? In other words, was he as intellectually lazy as a physician as he is as a politician?</description>

      <description>Here are my resolutions (which I don&amp;rsquo;t make) for 2004:
 I will leave my caps lock on 24x7x364, using Title Case on the 4th of July only. I will find a way to catch and save the little, black and green detritis unloosed through dental flossing. I will convince one person each week throughout the year that someone is out to get them, and that that someone is getting closer and closer.</description>

      <description>Everyone does it, so IÂll join the fray. If you feel tempted to wager based on these predictions, please just send the money to me: I need, and your chances of getting a return are much better.
Economy
The US economy will continue to expand at the fast pace since the Reagan administration through the second quarter. While new home construction will slow, service and other sectors will more than take its place.</description>

      <description>Back in 1989, the term Peace Dividend was all the rage. Peace Dividend referred to money Democrats could spend on welfare programs and pork as a result of the end of the Cold War. Today, Bush and Blair announced a new, better, and real dividend: the dividends of war.
After seeing the effectiveness of Bush&amp;rsquo;s policy in overthrowing Saddam, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has admitted trying to develop weapons of mass destruction &amp;ndash; but now plans to dismantle all such programs.</description>

      <description>The vassal of vascilationville, Kofi Annan, is frustrated that the US and the Iraqi Governing Council are not giveing him &amp;ldquo;specific answers&amp;rdquo; to his questions regarding the UN&amp;rsquo;s role in post-war Iraq. The ballsy son-of-a-*** is sounding pretty damn uppity about it.</description>

      <description>With the possible exception of phrenology, nothing has produced more false, even fraudulent science than has environmentalism. Scientists of various sorts with otherwise solid credentials have, for years, allowed their own political biases bastardize results of scientific inquiry in order to &amp;ldquo;prove&amp;rdquo; what is not provable or lacks valid scientific evidence.
Moreover, people, particularly procreative baby boomers and the generation that followed, believes such nonsense without critical questioning. Author Michael Crichton, himself an environmentalist and scientist, has had enough.</description>

      <description>Well, the President gets more positive coverage with a press conference, the Army announces the arrests of Iraqi resistence leaders based on information contained in documents found with Saddam, and the markets respond by turning down. The Dow, up by more tha 80 points earlier in the day, is at +60, while NASDAQ is just about flat at +2.
The American investor class knows nothing of patriotism. Sometimes, at seminal moments in history, it is right to subordinate your personal wealth to the national or world good.</description>

      <description>Saddam&amp;rsquo;s capture pushed the Asian and European markets up consistently and strongly, between 1% and 3.5% for all the majors. But in America, people who buy and sell stock are the strangest creatures on earth, and clearly the most in need of instant gratification. From way up to barely a blip, as greedy bastards in $7,000 suits sell, sell, sell at tiny margins to &amp;ldquo;lock in their profits.&amp;rdquo;
What a joke.</description>

      <description>Wildwood, MOâA Wildwood man is disappointed that a home improvement project proved more difficult than expected.
William Hennessy began a project to remove wallpaper and paint the master bedroom in his house in the Westglen Farms subdivision in Wildwood. Shortly after starting the job, he learned that, what he expected to take to hours, would take more than a day.
âAccording to the guy at Home Depot, this was a slam dunk,â said the unemployed software architect.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow our nation commemorates the 30th anniversary of judicial activismÂs most ignoble achievement.
Back in 1973, I remember my father coming home from his monthly MenÂs Club meeting at Epiphany of Our Lord Catholic Church in St. Louis with tears still streaking down his cheeks. Being the kind of man he is, he tried to hide them from the kids. ÂI canÂt believe I fought two wars for this country, only to have those bastards send us all to hell,Â he told my mother in the kitchen.</description>
