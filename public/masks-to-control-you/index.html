<p>And they did not arrive in this state of self-loathing on their own. They were convinced of their malignancy by &ldquo;experts&rdquo; and media and politicians. They were told to stay at home, but if you must go out, wear a mask. Hide your lowly identity. Be anonymous. You&rsquo;re not worthy of being seen, and certainly lack the credentials to have an opinion. &ldquo;And who are you,&rdquo; the Fake News likes to ask citizens who deign to exercise their First Amendment rights.</p>

<p>Kurt Cobain warned us of this day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the lights out, it&rsquo;s less dangerous</p>
<p>Here we are now, entertain us</p>
<p><strong>I feel stupid and contagious</strong></p>
<p>Here we are now, entertain us</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mask-wearers have been made to feel stupid and contagious.</p>
<p>The masks are not meant to control a disease; they&rsquo;re meant to control you.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been warned this day was coming, nearly 200 years ago.</p>
<h3 id="what-sort-of-despotism-democratic-nations-have-to-fear">What Sort Of Despotism Democratic Nations Have To Fear</h3>
<p>In his two-volume masterpiece on Democracy in America, the 19th century French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville left a warning for Americans. The warning was about the kind of despotism we might endure if we don&rsquo;t watch out.</p>
<figure class="figure">
    <a href="/images/tocqueville.jpg" class="d-block" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="post-gallery">

    </a><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
            Alexis de Tocqueville
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Tell me if this sounds like America today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Above this race of men stands an immense and tutelary power, which takes upon itself alone to secure their gratifications, and to watch over their fate. <strong>That power is absolute, minute, regular, provident, and mild</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think of Dr. Sam Page, the despot of St. Louis County, or Governor Gretchen &ldquo;half-&rdquo; Whitmer, der Führer of Michigan. Now, see if this doesn&rsquo;t remind you of the sing-songy, preachy, &ldquo;poor ignorant children&rdquo; teaching that spews from the festering gobs of swine such as them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be like the authority of a parent, if, like that authority, its object was to prepare men for manhood; <strong>but it seeks on the contrary to keep them in perpetual childhood</strong>: it is well content that the people should rejoice, provided they think of nothing but rejoicing. For their happiness such a government willingly labors, but <strong>it chooses to be the sole agent and the only arbiter of that happiness</strong>: it provides for their security, foresees and supplies their necessities, facilitates their pleasures, manages their principal concerns, directs their industry, regulates the descent of property, and subdivides their inheritances—<strong>what remains, but to spare them all the care of thinking and all the trouble of living?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, now, we get deeper into the <em>intent</em> of government Coronavirus regulations: <strong>the elimination of man</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus it every day renders the exercise of the free agency of man less useful and less frequent; it circumscribes the will within a narrower range, and gradually <strong>robs a man of all the uses of himself.</strong> The principle of equality has prepared men for these things: it has predisposed men to endure them, and oftentimes to look on them as benefits.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>After having thus successively taken each member of the community in its powerful grasp, and fashioned them at will, the supreme power then extends its arm over the whole community.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I interrupt here because what comes next will make the hair on your stand on end.</p>
<p>Having explained that this new democratic despotism has robbed you of your purpose in life, Tocqueville proceeds to explain what that government does to maintain its control over your mind and body.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>It covers the surface of society with a net-work of small complicated rules, minute and uniform, through which the most original minds and the most energetic characters cannot penetrate, to rise above the crowd.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every small business owner begging his or her Lordship or Ladyship for leave to operate his business feels that sentence like a wasp&rsquo;s sting.</p>
<p>And make no mistake: the <em>purpose</em> of these small complicated rules is precisely to bend merchants to the will of the state, to destroy their freedom and ambition, to remind them that &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t build that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tocqueville continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The will of man is not shattered, but softened, bent, and guided: <strong>men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are constantly restrained from acting</strong>:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Restrained from acting. &ldquo;No sunbathing on dry sand.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too close to that other person.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wear a mask.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a threat to everyone.&rdquo; &ldquo;Arrest that man! He&rsquo;s washing his car!&rdquo;</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let&rsquo;s continue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>such a power does not destroy, but it prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, but it compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to be nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every syllable of that sentence stirs the heart and draws forth a cry of &ldquo;FREEDOM!&rdquo; in every human being who still has a heart and will, who has not been compressed, enervated, extinguished, and stupefied by CNN, Dr. Fauci, and the evil assholes at WHO. School children should be forced to memorize that sentence and to adopt the Castle Doctrine should anyone in government attempt to foist such an existence upon them. Men have died and killed for much less.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have always thought that servitude of the regular, quiet, and gentle kind which I have just described, might be combined more easily than is commonly believed with some of the outward forms of freedom; and that it might even establish itself under the wing of the sovereignty of the people. Our contemporaries are constantly excited by two conflicting passions; they want to be led, and they wish to remain free: as they cannot destroy either one or the other of these contrary propensities, they strive to satisfy them both at once. They devise a sole, tutelary, and all-powerful form of government, but elected by the people. They combine the principle of centralization and that of popular sovereignty; this gives them a respite; they console themselves for being in tutelage by the reflection that they have chosen their own guardians. Every man allows himself to be put in leading-strings, because he sees that it is not a person or a class of persons, but the people at large that holds the end of his chain**. By this system the people shake off their state of dependence just long enough to select their master, and then relapse into it again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, here, Tocqueville explains the &ldquo;Karens&rdquo; and those sad, pathetic men in their 30s and 40s who have surrendered their manhood and adopted the mask of stupefied contagion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A great many persons at the present day are quite contented with this sort of compromise between administrative despotism and the sovereignty of the people; and they think they have done enough for the protection of individual freedom when they have surrendered it to the power of the nation at large. This does not satisfy me: the nature of him I am to obey signifies less to me than the fact of extorted obedience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Extorted obedience, indeed.</p>
<h3 id="i-feel-stupid-and-contagious">&ldquo;I Feel Stupid, And Contagious&rdquo;</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy and wrong to feel anger and resentment at the cowed, stupefied, and self-loathing people who simultaneous signal their virtue and their malignancy with masks and sheepish avoidance of their fellow humans. (I&rsquo;m not afraid of <em>them</em>; I&rsquo;m afraid of <em>me</em>.) It&rsquo;s not their fault. They&rsquo;ve been trained since infancy to think of themselves both as special beings filled with wonderful passions <em>and</em> as evil idiots who will hurt themselves and others if not for the benevolent despotism of schools, teachers, governments, and public health &ldquo;experts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These sheep have been trained to trust the CDC and the WHO, even though those two organizations have been completely wrong about everything involving Coronavirus. The very organization that promoted obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer for 40+ years, only recently admitting that <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/02/05/why-are-you-letting-your-doctor-kill-you/">the high carbohydrate diet governments and nutrition &ldquo;experts&rdquo; pushed</a> since the Johnson administration is the leading cause of all those diseases.</p>
<p>And, yet, the people cower in their kitchens, scarfing whole-grain Doritos, scrolling the WHO-approved Facebook headlines on their phones manufactured in the shadow of the communist Chinese lab that released COVID-19 on the world, learning if today is a &ldquo;wear a mask&rdquo; or  a &ldquo;don&rsquo;t wear a mask&rdquo; day, and hoping (praying, if so inclined) the day will soon come when they can herd their innocent children into a government clinic to be injected with the Microsoft Vaccine 2.0 for which, in its love and kindness, <a href="https://hennessysview.com/the-humane-approach-to-coronavirus-open-up-everything/">the government bypassed testing</a>. Their children might die from the shot, sure, but at least they&rsquo;ll die for a good cause, and they won&rsquo;t go to hell for accidentally infecting a stranger with Coronavirus.</p>
<p>Welcome to Alexis de Tocqueville&rsquo;s worst nightmare.</p>

                The most humanane approach to Coronavirus is to let it spread without overwhelming the hospitals in any location. Mitigation orders, such as wearing masks, stay-at-home orders, and maintaining six feet of distance, while well-intentioned, actually prolong the agony, except when required in places that are in danger of overwhelming the hospital system.
The idea that we can maintain this near-complete shutdown of society for as long as Coronavirus exists is a recipe for disaster on a Biblical scale.

                We have all come to know some things about Dr. Deborah Birx, the doctor responsible for the White House&amp;rsquo;s Coronavirus response. Her clear explanations often highlighted the nightly White House Coronavirus Task Force press conferences.
Night after night, we watched and listened as Dr. Birx carefully explained complex statistical and medical information in a way even a reporter could understand. Her style is considered and precise. Understatement and exaggeration seem genetic impossibilities for Dr.
