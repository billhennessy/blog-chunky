Now, there are a lot of reasons why I should wish to make you happier. But I have to admit that there’s something in it for me.</p>
<p>No, I don’t get 3 cents every time someone registers on <a href="https://thankfulfor.com">ThankfulFor.com</a>. But as a member of several grassroots organizations trying to change America, I want my teammates to be in the best possible spirits. For one thing, happier people are usually more fun to be around. More importantly, though, science tells us that happier people perform better.</p>
<p><strong>The Physician Study</strong></p>
<p>Happiness improves mental (cognitive) task performance. In one study, doctors were given a test. The physicians had to diagnose conditions based on symptoms as quickly as possible. They were graded on speed and accuracy. But first, the doctors were segmented into 3 groups. Group A was primed for happiness. Group B was primed for cognition by reading descriptions of the very diseases they were about to diagnose. Group C was not primed at all.</p>
<p>The results?</p>
<p>Groups B and C performed about the same. But the doctors primed to be happy blew them both out of the water. Group A was 50 percent fast and 80 percent more accurate. So if you&rsquo;re sick, find the happiest doctor, not the smartest one.</p>
<p><strong>And How Does This Apply to the Grassroots?</strong></p>
<p>Over a year ago, I started drawing a rough chart of how our moods should change over time:</p>
<p><a href="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Untitleddrawing2.png"><img src="https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Untitleddrawing2_thumb.png" alt="Untitleddrawing (2)">
</a></p>
<p>When we started on February 27, 2009, we were full of anger. Our solutions were very simple: gather and shout.</p>
<p>By election day 2010, we need to be mostly solutions. Solutions are much more difficult to advance than anger is to express. That’s why a lot of people feel lost and argumentative right now. In fact, I think some folks are resisting the change from high anger to high solutions. That’s understandable, too. But it’s not good enough.</p>
<p>For the rest of 2010, we need to execute a strategy that results in more people voting for liberty than for despotism. That requires everyone on the right being on top of his or her game. Like the doctors who were 50 percent faster and 80 percent more accurate, must execute with minimal friction. Anger and in-fighting are the worst kind of friction.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2010/05/10/how-to-be-happier/">try happiness for 21 days</a>. If you don’t like it, you can also get pissed off at me and return it for a full refund of rancor. But I know you’ll like happy better.</p>

                Happiness is a choice; anger is a tactic.
Anger will have to wait for a future post. This one is about happiness. So let me ask: would you do something that took less than a minute if that something would make you happier?
Martin Seligman at University of Pennsylvania’s school of Positive Psychology has broken down happiness in more scientifically measurable components:
* Positive Emotion** Engagement** Purpose  Other research has shown how to increase your happiness score.

                Feeling confident, relaxed, and complete is a dream. Many people believe it&amp;rsquo;s an impossible dream. I&amp;rsquo;m learning otherwise.
I&amp;rsquo;m into my third month of acquiring positive habits with Leo Babauta&amp;rsquo;sZen to Done method. At the same time, I&amp;rsquo;m working the 30 day challenge. What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far is that I hold onto too much.
 * I carried around anger and frustration over missed goals and failed or abandoned projects * I vilified good people (in my mind) because I wanted to get my way all the time about everything * I sabotaged myself by trying to do everything anyone asked of me * I was afraid to look weak, and that fear weakened me  The faultering economy, no doubt, led me toZen Habits, which led me to Zen to Done, which led me to &amp;ldquo;The Power of Less,&amp;rdquo; which led me to theSedona Method, which led me here.
