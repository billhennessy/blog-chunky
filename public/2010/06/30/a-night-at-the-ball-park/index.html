</a></p>
<p>But the real story, to me, is what happened last night. Three incidents vindicated the shift toward more community building work, even if that work comes at the expense of big, boisterous rallies.</p>
<p><strong>The Usher</strong></p>
<p>While we were assembling at the Stan Musial statue, a young man in a security guard or usher uniform approached me. He said, “I just recently figured out what the whole Tea Party movement is about, and I wanted you to know that I support you guys. Thank you for doing this.”</p>
<p>I told him “thanks,” and introduced myself and handed him a pocket Constitution and Declaration of Independence. He seemed to be in a hurry. But he’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>The Fan</strong></p>
<p>During the top of the ninth, I went over to section 331 to say goodbye to the large crowd there. (The Tea Partyers put me in the overflow seats two sections away from the main group. They know how I get.) On my way over, another young man stopped and told me he’d been supporting the tea party movement from a distance for a while. He, too , said “thanks” for what we do. I handed him a Constitution and told him to contact us through <a href="https://www.stlouisteaparty.com">www.stlouisteaparty.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Coverage</strong></p>
<p>Today, news of our accidental BUYcott of the game went viral. This certainly wasn’t planned. We didn’t issue a press release about the event. We just wanted to watch baseball with some of the friends we’ve made manning the barricades of freedom since 2009.</p>
<p><strong>The Vindication</strong></p>
<p>I realized a year ago that, without a network of people stronger, smarter, braver, and more energetic than me, I wouldn’t have organized that second tea party. (The first one was testimony to my own ignorance and tendency toward compulsion, and it was successful only because of Dana’s work.)</p>
<p>Well, if I need a strong fabric of people and groups to sustain me, then lots of other people do, too.</p>

</a></p>
<p>“How many people,” I wondered, “would join us in small groups, at house parties or block parties, even if they’re not comfortable coming out to a protest or rally?”</p>
<p>Through the retail work of meeting one person at a time, we unfurl the blanket of community that <a href="https://www.24thstate.com/2010/06/about-that-baseball-game.html">Jim Durbin talks about when he writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We like hanging out together. And while there will always be a little political theater when this group gets together, last night was really about getting out to the ballpark with friends, family, and the kids.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do like hanging out together. We know we’re safe and covered by our friends. We know our friends will keep us in line and steady us when we stumble. Even if they do make us sit two sections away.</p>
<p>So if you haven’t <a href="https://stlouisteaparty.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b6334042e74991364820c98c6&amp;id=733760e554">joined our ranks, please do</a>. We hold a <a href="https://throwdown2.eventbrite.com?ref=elink">little party every Thursday evening at Sky Music Lounge in Ballwin</a>. We’re working on adding additional locations for weekly get-togethers in South St. Louis City or County, North County, and Mid-County. We look for new Block Captains who will invest a few dollars and a couple hours in training and Constitutions. Please contact <a href="mailto:john.burns@stlouisteaparty.com">john.burns@stlouisteaparty.com</a> to become part of the solution to the problem government has left us.</p>
<p>Finally, about our little movement, let me say this. We never intended to create a new party or some massive blob of angry snarkiness. We just wanted our kids to find an America that’s a little freer, a little stronger, and little more fun than the one we inherited. That may sound like a grandiose plan, but it’s really the dream of every American man and woman since the Pilgrims formed their little colony in Massachusetts. If we accomplish that, we’ll have achieved no more than our parents and grandparents did.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, that’s one hell of an ambitious plan.</p>

                Do you worry that conservative grassroots might get overconfident and blow our chance to stop the advance of socialism in America?
I do. I am concerned that we keep repeating the same tactics to the same audiences until both the audience and the actors become . . . well, bored.
When I read stories like this one, that GOP sentiment is at an all-time high, I worry that some on our side might decide they can go back to their regularly scheduled programming.

                A Washington Post/ABC News poll shows a major shift in sentiment toward (against?) the tea party movement.
I would not challenge the accuracy of the results which show the tea party’s popularity waning among Southerners and people 18 to 29. In fact, the poll shows that a full 50 percent of Americans now have a negative view of the tea party.
Sure, there may have been some chicanery with the questions to skew the results.

                Thirty-two years ago this month, the modern conservative movement was born.
The movement began with a local issue in a single state. Howard Jarvis of California succeeded in rolling back that state’s property taxes. Voters ignored Governor Jerry Brown’s apocalyptic predictions and captured the imaginations of a nation. After decades of government growth, the people of America’s largest state said, “Enough!”

As economist Stephen Moore wrote on cato.org a dozen years ago:
