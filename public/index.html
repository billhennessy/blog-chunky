                    Donald Trump just had another one of those weeks for which he&rsquo;s become famous.
 There was the week hit bombed Syria while dining with President Xi of China at Mar a Lago. There was Easter Week 2019 when the Mueller Report exonerated and the economy hit new highs. There was the week of the State of the Union Address that included his exoneration in the Senate.  But, this week&rsquo;s outbreak of liberty and its commensurate exposure of Trump&rsquo;s enemies as pure scum is the best so far.

                It would be the most sinister murder plot in US history. Imagine a governor conspiring to thin the population of elderly people, using a pandemic as both cover and weapon.
As unimaginable as it would be, evidence is mounting New York Governor Andrew Cuomo did just that: culled the herd in nursing homes by weaponizing Coronavirus.
Dumped Off With Their Own Body Bags New York Governor Andrew Cuomo implemented an emergency declaration that required nursing homes to accept active Coronavirus patients regardless of their ability to care for or isolate the infected patients.

                A lot of doctors seem to derive much pleasure from convincing people that Coronavirus will kill us all very soon. Very soon. These are the Doomsday Doctors. And if they&amp;rsquo;re right, we need to eliminate all behavior restrictions immediately and enjoy our final days.
The latest tactic of the Doomsday Doctors is to report (non-peer reviewed) that the Coronavirus has mutated into a weapons-grade killer that no one can avoid or resist.

The dossier doesn&amp;rsquo;t connect the dots for you, but they&amp;rsquo;re now easy to connect. So easy, even I can do it. The story goes something like this.
 China was playing around with dangerous natural microbes in order to prove that it was as good as the USA at studying and neutralizing infectious diseases.

 Science is facing a &amp;ldquo;reproducibility crisis&amp;rdquo; where more than two-thirds of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist&amp;rsquo;s experiments, research suggests.
 Two years earlier, in 2015, a major study found the same problem, with nearly the same numbers, involving psychology.

Now, the law firm that once represented Flynn has release thousands of documents it previously illegally refused to turn over. One of those documents is a handwritten note.

                In the past 48 hours, the World Health Organization has spread misinformation about the Coronavirus intended to keep economies closed for good.
On Saturday, the WHO, through its propaganda tools like the New York Times, Twitter, Facebook, and CNN, released a statement that Coronavirus antibodies offered no protection against catching the disease a second time. This statement was factually wrong, but the media quickly broadcast the false statement.
On Sunday, after an outcry by physicians and researchers, the WHO amended its statement to say &amp;ldquo;there is no evidence&amp;rdquo; that Coronavirus antibodies protect people from the disease.

                Coronavirus could wipe out the open office floor plan as quickly and decisively as it wiped out many corporate bottom lines.
Companies that move to an open office cite two benefits for the design:
  Cost savings by cramming more people into a given amount of space.
  Increased innovation, driven by collaboration.
  But multiple studies show that both assumptions are wrong. Now, Coronavirus has proven that open offices represent a significant public health threat, as well.

Hatred. Pure, unadulterated hate.
Nothing but raging emotion can explain why both YouTube and Twitter went on the offensive against the biotech company AYTU Healight this weekend, banning the company from their platforms.
What AYTU Healight did to earn deplatforming: it found favor with the man the China-controlled World Health Organization hates.
Donald Trump merely asked his mecical experts about the possibilities of AYTU Healight&amp;rsquo;s Far-UVC catheter technology.

The latest confirmation of Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s Law just completed.
In March, Donald Trump and others said that warm weather would diminish the spread of Coronavirus, just as it diminishes the flu. The reason: virus that survive well in cool, dry conditions don&amp;rsquo;t do well in warm, humid conditions.

                I know President Trump mocks the idea of herd immunity, but there&amp;rsquo;s really no other option absent a vaccine. And if we keep in lockdown until a vaccine is widely available, millions will die from the collapsed economy and collapsed infrastructure.
What makes Coronavirus more dangerous than flu is lack of immune people.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say that both kill about .01 to .02 percent of everyone who catches them, just for argument&amp;rsquo;s sake.

The headlines and stories are clearly intended to make people panic. The media want people to stay locked in their homes, and they want people to demand that government keeps the brave locked in their homes, as well.

Source: The Covid Tracking Project
Key Insight: For every week, Hospitalization rate decreases by about 9.19%.
From My Original Tweet The most important number regarding Coronavirus is a number none of the tracking sites or governments will tell you: acceleration. Lower acceleration of hospitalization and deaths is good. It means the number of new incidents yesterday was smaller than the new incidents from the day before.

                Wearing masks in public will change the way people behave, and the consequences for society could be devastating.
The White House released the plan to Open America Again. It&amp;rsquo;s reasonable, 3-phase plan that relaxes Coronavirus restrictions in 14-day increments. As a state achieves certain metrics, based on CDC surveillance data, it advances to the next phase.
Phases one and two allow increased activity with the recommendation of requiring face masks when in confined public places like work.

You will notice that COVID-19 is a rather mundane specimen. As of April 10, its death toll fell somewhere between the Yellow Fever of the late 1800s and Ebola of 2014-2015.

The IHME models the CDC used as their primary source to justify the destruction of President Trump&amp;rsquo;s beautiful economy turned out to be no better than guesses from three drunks at a bar. The IHME factored in strict mitigation (lockdown), but they still over estimated everything by factors as high as 40.
That models were unbelievably bad is not open to debate. The models were hideously bad.

Modley fired Captain Brett Crozier after Crozier&amp;rsquo;s letter to a wide distribution list appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle.

As we retell our semi-fictionalized story to ourselves or others, we pad the hero&amp;rsquo;s character and tarnish the villain&amp;rsquo;s with each telling.

You probably know people who are concerned about a &amp;ldquo;surveillance state&amp;rdquo; developing. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re one of them. I know I am.
It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable fear.
Some police departments are using drones to spy on people in their homes, peering into living rooms and bedrooms with digital cameras and fining or arresting people who have more than the imposed limit of guests. The justification the state gives for these intrusions is, of course, coronavirus.

                SEATTLE — Left-wing terrorist group Antifa has threatened to sue non-members wearing protective masks in public as a violation of the group&amp;rsquo;s trademark.
&amp;ldquo;Wearing masks in public as a form of intimidation and anonymity is our thing,&amp;rdquo; said Seattle-area organizer Josh Millgram. &amp;ldquo;These fascists are ruining the brand. I mean, look, with everybody out there wearing some sort of mask, we don&amp;rsquo;t even know who to hit.&amp;rdquo;
Antifa Seattle&amp;rsquo;s general counsel and chief operating officer, Heidi Berkhardt, wrote in a statement, &amp;ldquo;by long use and general practice, the Antifa mask has become a trademark for the organization.

Bloomberg now cites many &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo; who agree with me on this:
 It doesn’t matter that the United States surpassed China this week in reported Covid-19 cases because those numbers (83,507 and 81,782 respectively as of March 26) don’t tell us how many people actually became infected in either country.

Monsignor Eugene Morris of the Oratory of Ss. Gregory and Augustine is livestreaming the Holy Mass each Sunday at 8:00 a.m. You can watch live on the Oratory&amp;rsquo;s Facebook page.
How to Get the Most from the Mass in Time of Pestilence Msgr. Morris has published a guide to keeping the Mass holy in this time of pestilence as we watch from home instead of participating in the pews.

Several bad ideas have become institutionalized in America in recent decades. These bad ideas have served the virus well, made it more deadly, and forced us to shut down our economy.

                Today, President Trump nailed it.
 “What we did was we closed everything down. That was our public health strategy. Just close everything, all businesses, old workers, young people, old people, short people, tall people. Every school closed, everything.”
  “If you rethought that or had time to analyze that public health strategy, I don&amp;rsquo;t know that you would say quarantine everyone. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know that that was the best public health policy.

                Hysterical headlines scream about the number of new coronavirus infections every hour. This is a mistake. Ignore those headlines. Number of confirmed cases will rise as number of people tested rises. If we tested everyone for the flu, the number of confirmed flu cases would be astronomical.
Doing some casual analysis, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious what drives the death rate: the number of hospitalizations in a given geographic area.
Last week I pointed out that mean averages are meaningless, even destructive if used to project into the future.

While I&amp;rsquo;ve been in favor of &amp;ldquo;overreacting&amp;rdquo; to the coronavirus pandemic, we will have no choice but to simply return to status quo ante without immediate economic relief.
I urge President Trump to give 24 hours to pass the Republican Senate emergency relief bill. If it hasn&amp;rsquo;t passed, end the national emergency, rescind all disaster declarations declared on behalf of states, and order the DOJ and the National Guard to guarantee freedom of speech, movement, religion, and commerce in every state.

President Trump become an enemy of the left for just one policy proposal: controlling national borders. Trump not only wanted to restore US border controls that were left to decay since the 1960s, he also encouraged other nations to treat their borders like the front doors of their homes.

                Several friends tell me we are overreacting to the Coronavirus pandemic. Others say we are too complacent. So, which is it?
When dealing with an epidemic, we need to consider two things:
 Current numbers are not very useful. Effects are non-linear.  Beware Current Numbers The first argument I hear from those who wish we&amp;rsquo;d just go on with life as usual involves current statistics: number of confirmed cases, number of dead, etc.

Now, there&amp;rsquo;s really no empirical reason to stock up on food and water. But there is a psychological/economic reason: the Common Knowledge game.
Common Knowledge is something everyone knows everyone knows. When something becomes Common Knowledge, most people will behave as if the &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; were true, if it is not. Stock markets are perfect example of Common Knowledge games.

                Long ago in South St. Louis Mom and Dad would go to an early Mass on Sundays. Maybe 6:30, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. Anyway, it was early. They&amp;rsquo;d bring home donuts from Donut Drive-In on Chippewa.
But between the time they left for Mass and the time they returned with donuts, us kids would get into mischief. As I remember it, my oldest sister, Tee, started it.
Tee would come downstairs, go straight to the ice box, open the freezer, pull out the newish carton of Neapolitan ice cream (&amp;ldquo;newish&amp;rdquo; because Mom and Dad shopped on Thursdays), and stand over the sink eating it with a big spoon straight from the carton.

Here&amp;rsquo; a brief description from David John Marotta, What Is Rent-Seeking Behavior in Forbes
 Rent-seeking doesn&amp;rsquo;t add any national value. It is coerced trade and benefits only one side. Rent-seeking can include piracy, lobbying the government or even just giving away money.
 There are two kinds of lobbyists.
One kind of lobbyist is necessary to keep legislators and executive-branch bureaucrats informed and on notice. These lobbyists protect the interests of special interest group, but often their special interest needs protection because it is at the mercy of the government.

Jerry Garcia of Grateful Dead was famous for saying &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s about the journey, not the destination.&amp;rdquo;
Garcia was wrong.
There are two possible destinations:
 Eternal perfection. Eternal misery.  It&amp;rsquo;s all about the destination. The destination is all that matters.
The journey matters only insofar as it determines the destination. If you know and pursue the right destination, the journey will be difficult, often painful, often lonely, often frustrating.

                A celebrity priest fired up Twitter today by endorsing same-sex &amp;ldquo;marriage&amp;rdquo; and by comparing a same-sex couple favorably to the Holy Family.
Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that the good father is not malicious but so poorly educated into reason and Church teaching that his embarrassing tweets make sense to him. Let&amp;rsquo;s pretend Fr. Sichko thinks he&amp;rsquo;s right.
To help educate the ignorant priest (and educating the ignorant is one of our Christian duties), I&amp;rsquo;ll pose some questions to Fr.

                A Frenchman named Michel Chiron was possessed by demons for decades. His story of exorcism revealed something remarkable.
In an interview with Solène Tadié for National Catholic Register, Chiron said the demons possessing him mocked Jesus but feared &amp;ldquo;The Woman.&amp;rdquo;
About Jesus:
 They told me he did exist in the past but that he should be forgotten, as nowadays human beings no longer needed him. They even said that he was with their king now.

Nixon resigned. He resigned after a half-dozen Republican Senators told him, in the Oval Office, that a majority of Senators would vote to remove him from office if the House impeached him.
So Nixon resigned.
Nixon&amp;rsquo;s crimes were limited to covering up a break-in and wiretapping by employees of his re-election committee.
Baraka Obama did worse. And he got by.
Obama out-dicked Nixon.
The IG Report Department of Justice Inspector-General Michael Horowitz released his report on Monday.

                You can deplatform Twitter and damage their business model. You don&amp;rsquo;t need money or special skills or lawyers. But deplatforming Twitter requires two things:
 Commitment. Friends.  Friends can be strangers, as long as they use Twitter. Twitter followers are perfect friends for this action.
What Is &amp;ldquo;Deplatforming&amp;rdquo; and Why Should We Do It? Deplatforming is one of these new words that irritate me. But new words have the virtue of universality.

A woman wrote that her husband told her he was going to Mass after work. But he went to a bar, instead. She went to the bar. He was there. He was drunk.
She asked for our prayers.
I said one for her, and two for her husband.

 And that&amp;rsquo;s the problem with name-calling. When we impose a derogatory label on someone, we invite scrutiny upon ourselves. We label ourselves as the opposite of the names we impose on others.

Being unpopular is pretty easy. And it&amp;rsquo;s hard, too. It&amp;rsquo;s easy because there&amp;rsquo;s only one rule, which we&amp;rsquo;ll get to in a moment. It&amp;rsquo;s hard for two reasons: beforehand, it&amp;rsquo;s scary to think about following the rule. Afterwards, it&amp;rsquo;s lonely and painful to have followed the rule.

                I was gladdened to see Bishop Robert Barron&amp;rsquo;s tweets of anger about the Pew survey. Watch the attached video. (You will also be happy to hear the Pew survey didn&amp;rsquo;t shock the bishop.)
I wish, though, his excellency had addressed the real cause of Catholics losing their faith: the ugly and sacrilegious farce that is the Novus Ordo (or Ordinary Form) Mass.
Here&amp;rsquo;s Bishop Barron&amp;rsquo;s initial tweet. I urge you to watch the video attached.

                St. Lawrence of Rome is the patron saint of comedians. I had no idea there was one. But there is, and it&amp;rsquo;s St. Lawrence. He earned that designation for his obstinate and comedic refusal to deny Christ, even to his death.
From The Catholic Company:
 He was appointed by Pope St. Sixtus II as archdeacon over the seven deacons of Rome, and held the sacred duty of tending to the Church&amp;rsquo;s wealth and distributing alms to the poor.

And we don&amp;rsquo;t listen.
Yesterday, we looked at three reasons people don&amp;rsquo;t listen:
 The Semmelweis Reflex, which says people reject information that contradicts longstanding beliefs. The Power of the Status Quo, which says people believe the future will always be a linear progression of the recent past.

Let me begin by saying &amp;ldquo;I am sorry&amp;rdquo; to Robert Mueller and his family.
I have been critical of Mr. Mueller and his sham &amp;ldquo;investigation.&amp;rdquo; I have been uncharitable to him. And I am sorry.
It became clear today that Mr. Mueller wasn&amp;rsquo;t a hostile actor. Obviously, Mueller is seriously impaired. What we saw in his selection of lawyers, in his handling of the investigation, in his management of partisan and criminal conduct by senior Justice Department officials under his command resulted not from malice toward the president but from incompetence.

Chelsea Handler lost her mind because reality violated her expectations.
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure Ms. Handler doesn&amp;rsquo;t read Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View, but you do. So, for you, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you how to avoid losing your mind when reality violates your expectations.

                Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to Latin Mass instead of the new mass. Latin Mass feels like home to me. It feels like a call to holiness. Every detail of the Latin Mass has meaning, not just to me, but to everyone who&amp;rsquo;s studied scripture. The words, the gestures, the artifacts like the communion rail all have deep meaning. I don&amp;rsquo;t think the new mass is heretical; I just don&amp;rsquo;t think it lifts us up toward God.

That&amp;rsquo;s dangerous, as I pointed out in my post on loving Rachel Maddow:
 Finally, we still don’t know the details of the Mueller report. It could contain information that sends conservatives to Twitter to express our rage and anger. We don’t know.

One of those opportunities to love came to us yesterday. Independent counsel Robert Mueller delivered to the Attorney General his final report on potential crimes involving the 2016 presidential election and the Trump campaign.
The lede of that story was this: no new indictments.

                Tina Turner not withstanding, love is not an emotion, and that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing.
In today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel (from the modern lectionary), Jesus tells his disciples to &amp;ldquo;love your enemies&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;pray for those who persecute you.&amp;rdquo;
But how? I find it difficult even to be around certain people, much less love them. Surely, Jesus wasn&amp;rsquo;t serious when He told us to love our enemies, right? If Jesus meant what He said, then I must not know what love means.

                My heart and soul needed a good spring cleaning, and Lent arrived just in time.
Lent is fasting season. Most people know what fasting is, but many people don&amp;rsquo;t know what religious fasting is for. What good does fasting do the soul?
Fasting is form of asceticism. That means intentionally depriving yourself of some comfort or sensual pleasure. Asceticism does not require pain or self-flagellation. Self-flagellation tends to lead to pride and should be avoided.

                In a blog I never published for fear of being thought insane, I conveyed a prophecy:
 Many Christians will be accused of crimes against the state for simply following Christ&amp;rsquo;s teachings and believing that Jesus is our lord and savior. When you are accused and at trial, the Holy Spirit will speak through you if you let Him. You won&amp;rsquo;t need to come up with your own defense. Anyone might betray you and cause you to be put to death, even your parents or your children.

Lent is a time of repentance and atonement in anticipation of the commemoration of the passion, death, and resurrection of Christ Jesus. The whole idea of repentance and atonement always bothered me.
Until now.
This year, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for Lent to begin.
First, I&amp;rsquo;ve been called to redirect my zeal away from politics and toward God. Instead of bringing people into communion with the Constitution and liberty, I&amp;rsquo;m asked to bring people to Christ and Christ to people.

Further, fasting is the simplest thing you can do to improve your physical and mental health. There are only two things to remember:
 Don&amp;rsquo;t eat. Drink some water.

I spent all day moving my blog from a self-hosted Wordpress site to a Hugo static site. Since I no longer support advertising, I don&amp;rsquo;t need all the weight of Wordpress. Plus, managing a blog through Github is actually easier for me. I use git professionally. And I pretty much think in Markdown at this point.
The final reason for the move is the change in direction for this blog.

Talking about the possibility of Democrats seizing control of the US House of Representatives, he said, &amp;ldquo;could happen . . . could happen.&amp;rdquo;
But the killer line we all must remember came next: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it.

Democrats use refugees like pawns in their perverted and wicked quest for power.
Once upon a time, nearly all asylum seekers were turned away by the United States. These were times when Democrats ran the White House or both Houses of Congress.
Most recently, the Obama administration banned all asylum seekers from Cuba.

                Amendment 1 would turn over Missouri&amp;rsquo;s state and federal gerrymandering to an unelected demographer. This means there&amp;rsquo;s an 8 to 1 chance (87.5%) that the demographer will be a Democrat. Demography is a social science. Social science majors are mostly far left or liberal. Only a handful of social science majors call themselves conservative:
 A 2015 study by psychologist José Duarte, then at Arizona State University, and his colleagues in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, entitled “Political Diversity Will Improve Social Psychological Science,” found that 58 to 66 percent of social scientists are liberal and only 5 to 8 percent conservative and that there are eight Democrats for every Republican.

I should have paid more attention to Scott Adams in those days. Scott used pure statistical reasoning to conclude that the packages probably came from a crazy Trump supporter: base cases. There are more crazy people than there are brilliant criminal strategists who hate Trump.

Don&amp;rsquo;t take this lightly. Father Richard Heilman and folks at the Holy League have asked Christians to pray the Lorica of St. Patrick for Justice Kavanaugh, substituting &amp;ldquo;Brett Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Justice Kavanaugh&amp;rdquo; for the first person pronouns.

                The trains to Auschwitz ran on time. Brutal dictatorships love efficiency. Stalin. Hitler. Mao. Pol Pot. The best mass murderers are efficient. Psychopaths feed on efficiency.

Democracy is inefficient. As are all republics. (A republic is any form of government that&amp;rsquo;s open to the public.

A 54-day novena for our nation. It ends on October 7 with the Rosary Coast-to-Coast. Which means it started before I learned of either. But that&amp;rsquo;s okay. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to do the novena to do say the Rosary. Just show up at any of the Rosary stations around the area at 3:00 on October 7.

                One week after Archbishop Carlo Viganò released his bombshell letter, it looks obvious that Pope Francis admits the key allegation: Francis knew McCarrick to be a serial molester, and he returned McCarrick to public ministry anyway. As we&amp;rsquo;ll see later in this post, Pope Francis has a pattern of letting molesters and their protectors off the hook.

                One man can confirm or deny the central allegation against Pope Francis. The Catholic Church needs that man to step up now.
In an 11-page letter by former US Nuncio (ambassador) Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, Pope Francis is accused of ignoring warnings about Cardinal Timothy McCarrick. Viganò claims he personally delivered the warning to Pope Francis in 2013. The pope allegedly ignored the warning and the dossier on McCarrick in 2013.

 Pope Francis ignored evidence of crimes and overturned punishment imposed by Pope Benedict on the wicked and disgraced Cardinal McCarrick. That&amp;rsquo;s according to a former papal nuncio and corroborated by a former first counselor to the nunciature to the United States speaking on the record. The two men have direct knowledge of the matter.
Pope Francis refused to comment on the allegations that he personally covered up McCarrick&amp;rsquo;s crimes.

The Eastern religions—Buddhism and Hinduism—compartmentalize faith from daily life. They protect believers from the risks of a leap of faith.

Today&amp;rsquo;s Gospel reading comes from John 6. John chapter 6 is all about the bread of life. In it, Jesus shocks his Jewish followers by announcing that they must eat his flesh and drink his blood to achieve eternal life.
When some of his disciples challenged this formula for immortality, Jesus doubled down, saying:
 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.

                I heard a story a long time ago. From a woman who escaped the Soviet Union and came to America.
She told us how lucky we are in America to have priests. She urged us to pray in thanksgiving every day that we have priests.
The communists in Russia outlawed religion. While some religions continued to operate, the government seemed to have a particular hatred of Catholics. Russian communists were familiar with the unique power of priests to consecrate the sacrifice and administer sacraments.

                Because of my sinfulness and selfishness, I was out of communion with the blessed sacrament for most of my adult life. To anyone who&amp;rsquo;s never been excommunicated, you cannot imagine the pain and humiliation of being in that state.
Being a coward, I avoided mass. I was too embarrassed. Week after week, my neighbors would see me not going to communion. I&amp;rsquo;d have to get up and let the communicants through, then kneel back down, often alone.

This morning, I tried to listen in silence for God&amp;rsquo;s answers to my questions.
What do we say about the news out of Pennsylvania? How do we answer those who taunt and ridicule the Church? How do we settle our anger at the priests and bishops and cardinals who protected the pederasts for decades? How do we reconcile the hideous criminality of those men with the uncountable graces God freely gave them through the many sacraments they&amp;rsquo;ve received?

                A great colleague and I invented something in 2010. It was a two-day workshop for companies. It has been incredibly successful.
In that workshop, we cite a lot of behavioral science research. We also point out that some behavioral science research is bogus. Up to 60 percent by a recent study (which might have been bogus itself.) So how do you know good science from bad?
Look for consistency. I&amp;rsquo;ll give you an example.

Yesterday, a colleague asked if she could speak to me. I naturally thought I had done something wrong.

                God made man and woman, and man and woman screwed everything up. So, eventually, God gave up the comforts of heaven and most of the perks of being God to become a man on earth and show us how to do it right. Instead of thanking Him for the tutoring, we ridiculed, tortured, and murdered Him.
Lucky for us, a few guys took notes while Jesus was here. And they published them.

Longtime readers might recall that my views on the death penalty are a bit nuanced. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t always have the courage to express it.
In 2014, I wrote:
 I don’t buy the idea that the death penalty is no deterrent. I don’t buy the notion that the death penalty should be banned. I think the availability of such a punishment serves its purpose.

Dottie is a phenomenal campaigner. She knocked on over 4,000 doors between April and August. Her efforts resulted in an enormous 19 percentage-point win despite being outspent by her opponent. Making Dottie&amp;rsquo;s more impressive is the fact that Doell had been elected to the Rockwood board three times while this was Dottie&amp;rsquo;s first race ever.

Voters in House District 110 are asking why they received such a &amp;ldquo;disgusting&amp;rdquo; flyer from candidate Matt Doell.
Answer: Probably because he&amp;rsquo;s losing badly.
Matt Doell has decided to get dirty. And personal. And mean. (Horrible internals?)
While Dottie Bailey has knocked doors, attended coffees, and generally met with voters, Matt Doell rubbed elbows with hot-shots and union bosses and avoided anything that looks like an &amp;ldquo;ordinary person.

But the worst example of cronyism and arrogance went largely unreported. (The great Elliott Davis caught it, though. Video to follow.)
Rockwood Board&amp;rsquo;s Secret Response The late auditor Tom Schweich released Rockwood&amp;rsquo;s horrible audit on February 28, 2013.

                Rush Limbaugh says radical feminism&amp;rsquo;s goal is to see that every abortion that can happen does.
Today, I witnessed the opposite of that murderous goal. Today, I was lucky enough to rub elbows with beautiful people who make sure every life that can happen does. And every life saved is given the necessities to thrive.

                Many years ago, a company hired a new president.
After several months on the job, this new president learned that most of his employees couldn&amp;rsquo;t pick him out of a line-up. He spent so much time in his office or in meetings or traveling that he rarely met with the people who reported to him.
To fix this problem, he set up a series of lunches. They were off-site at restaurants around town.

                One of the candidates for Missouri House District 110 (Eureka, Wildwood, and Pacific) sent out a mailer to voters today. The mailer talks about &amp;ldquo;local control&amp;rdquo; of education, and many other fine platitudes that poll well. In other news,** while this candidate was on the Rockwood School District board of directors** (the district that serves most of Eureka, Wildwood, and Pacific), **bad things happened**. Like this:
 The Rockwood School District overpaid its longtime construction management company by more than $1.

                I invite you to join a centuries-old tradition: fasting for a cause. Moses and Jesus fasted for 40 days. But this Primary Fast will last only 14. Some fasts require that you eat nothing during the fast. But this Primary Fast lets you eat one full, wonderful meal a day. Did you know that General Stanley McChrystal has lived on just one meal a day for decades. And one meal a day was enough to drive him through the war against al Qaeda.

                One of the candidates running for the state House of Representatives in District 110 has been on the Rockwood School Board since 2011. In a campaign mailer, this candidate claims he&amp;rsquo;s cut taxes in the district. Is that true?
Well, it&amp;rsquo;s true that the property tax rate in Rockwood has been reduced twice during his tenure. But that&amp;rsquo;s not even close to the whole picture. Since the 2010-2011 school year, when this candidate joined the board, Rockwood has raised taxes 5 times.

                Some people complain about politicians not representing their constituents well. I disagree. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my life, all politicians do a great job of representing their constituents. They really do.
If I&amp;rsquo;m right about politicians being 100% true to their constituents, then why are so many voters so unhappy with the people they voted for? It&amp;rsquo;s simple: the voters aren&amp;rsquo;t every politician&amp;rsquo;s constituents. That&amp;rsquo;s right. Not all politicians consider the people who vote for them constituents.

                A great State Rep decides to give up his seat. The seat previously held by the Speaker of the House and a conservative legend. A seat in, perhaps, the most reliably conservative House district in St. Louis County.
Now, there&amp;rsquo;s a battle for that seat. A battle between a left-leaning Establishment Republican and a grassroots Conservative activist. An activist whose work for the right causes earned a star on Heritage Action&amp;rsquo;s Wall of Honor.

The woman was very beautiful,3 and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, “She is Bathsheba,the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.” 4 Then David sent messengers to get her.

One of the old stories in the Eric Greitens category was my first comments on his book Resilience﻿. My old post talked about why it took me so long to finish the book. And it contained two short passages from the book.

When I read about Schaff&amp;rsquo;s latest endorxement of the Clean Missouri petition initiative, I believed the stories. This is dangerous stuff. If Clean Missouri becomes law, State Senator Rob Schaff&amp;rsquo;s proposal would flip our state legislature from Republican Red to a deep and dirty Democrat Blue.

In the 1980s, leftist professors, leftist news media, and leftist entertainers were angry. For years, they&amp;rsquo;d preached that Ronald Reagan was a neo-Nazi buffoon whose incompetence and malice would destroy America. Maybe even wipe out the human species. &amp;ldquo;I believe Ronald Reagan can turn America back into what it once was,&amp;rdquo; said comedian Steve Martin on Saturday Night Live in 1980, &amp;ldquo;a vast wasteland covered with ice.

                Forgive me. I say &amp;ldquo;liberal&amp;rdquo; sometimes when I mean something else.
My mistake is habit, not irony. (Irony would require some intent on my part.)
I grew up disparaging liberalism. I grew up reading and watching William F. Buckley Jr., for whom liberalism was the enemy.
In the post-WWII era, the liberalism of the day was a problem. But it was never the problem.
The problem in Western Civilization was a faction that used liberalism as cover.

The reason: President Trump&amp;rsquo;s pressure on owners to crack down on anthem haters will stir up a fight between NFL Players Association and the owners.
As if on cue:

President Trump seems pathologically opposed to festering problems. When he sees a festering problem, he pops it like a zit. For example, the North Korean nukes problem has festered since the Clinton administration. Trump is bringing Little Rocket Man to a head.
NAFTA has been festering since the Clinton administration. Trump is bringing NAFTA to a head.

Villanueva served three tours of combat duty as an Army Ranger. He&amp;rsquo;s authorized to wear the Bronze Star. He stood for his country. In Afghanistan with the Army and in Pittsburgh alone.

                You can see the battle brewing. It&amp;rsquo;s coming to a head. And no one is telling you the real reason the NFL is dying before your eyes.
Everyone sees the symptoms of football&amp;rsquo;s death spiral: empty stadiums. Crashed ratings. low quality. Criminals on the field. Some people call it &amp;ldquo;the National Felony League.&amp;rdquo;
Frustrated fans look for better entertainment. Ticket sales remain high for one reason: stupid corporate executives. Stupid executives think it&amp;rsquo;s still a status symbol to control lots of NFL tickets.

I felt like the lone voice on the right last week when I wrote &amp;ldquo;Counseling Sessions.&amp;rdquo; It feels great to have Greg Jarrett agree: Jeff Sessions should resign.
As Jarrett puts it:
 Sessions appears either incapable or incompetent. He has resisted producing the documents relevant to the anti-Trump dossier which were subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee. He has failed to appoint a special counsel to reopen the case against Hillary Clinton for likely violations of the Espionage Act in the use of her email server, obstruction of justice for destroying 33,000 emails under congressional subpoena, and potential self-dealing for profit through her foundation.

CNN previously mocked and scorned President Trump for suggesting Obama wiretapped Trump&amp;rsquo;s campaign. CNN says Mueller&amp;rsquo;s office cautioned that conclusions about Russian connection were &amp;ldquo;inconclusive.

                You wake up and nothing works.
No electricity.
No cell phone or land line.
No radio.
No electric tooth brush.
No internet or cable.
No laptop. No tablet.
Car: nothing.
What happened?
No, it&amp;rsquo;s not a scene from the Twilight Zone. It&amp;rsquo;s the aftermath of an electromagnetic pulse attack. EMP for short.
An EMP attack would look like this:
** North Korea launches an ICBM toward North America ** The warhead detonates 100 miles above Colorado ** Waves of electromagnetic energy pulse down across the fruited plain ** Every semiconductor and small wire in the United States burns out

Maybe it already happened. Maybe we just haven&amp;rsquo;t heard.
Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a few days away.
But it&amp;rsquo;s coming, folks. Believe me, it&amp;rsquo;s coming. And it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a doozy.
So many lefties were hoping that Hurricane Harvey would finally knock out President Trump. If they pray, they prayed. They prayed for a monumental catastrophe. They prayed for total collapse of FEMA.

Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened.
Someone posted this photo on twitter. All the sane people laughed.
@realDonaldTrump retweeted. And now it&amp;rsquo;s the left&amp;rsquo;s new Russian conspiracy.
I remember when all the best comedians were liberals. But the new left traded its sense of humor for baseball bats with ten penny nails.
USA!
Meanwhile, the pre-schoolers at CNN have their panties in a bunch because the President of the United States wore a hat emblazoned with USA.

 Dear People of Houston (and thereabouts),
President Trump has said, &amp;ldquo;the whole world is watching.&amp;rdquo; And he&amp;rsquo;s right!
When people say &amp;ldquo;the whole world is watching,&amp;rdquo; they usually mean it as a warning.

Today, in Houston, we saw the America of our dreams. The America that makes us cry when we hear the national anthem. Or when we see a soldier in Iraq bending down to help a tiny Iraqi child.

Arthur C. Brooks wrote in The Conservative Heart:
 There is a common misconception that conservatives are materialistic. We are not, and this confusion is a central political irony of our time. Progressives truly want to help the poor but have tried to solve poverty primarily with government money, relegating talk of culture to the past and focusing more and more on income inequality.

One day after Hennessy&amp;rsquo;s View reported Speaker Paul &amp;ldquo;Dumbbell&amp;rdquo; Ryan as a member of the Antifa caliphate support team, Speaker Ryan&amp;rsquo;s office renounced his membership in the terrorist group&amp;rsquo;s fan club.

In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it, Antifa has effectively shut down grass roots conservative speech. You cannot hold a public rally, march, or carnival if your views conflict with Antifa&amp;rsquo;s.
Antifa has established a small caliphate in North America. Just like ISIS did in Syria and Iraq.
And the government&amp;rsquo;s doing absolutely nothing about it. You should read my military strategy post and all the links.

                CNN screwed up. And it reminds me of an incident from 1970.
A headline writer admitted that the Antifa terror group seeks &amp;ldquo;peace through violence.&amp;rdquo; Later, presumably after receiving threats from Antifa terrorists, CNN removed the &amp;ldquo;peace through violence&amp;rdquo; sub-head.
But the damage was done. CNN stumbled onto real news. Real news that exposes Antifa&amp;rsquo;s terrorist aims.
Before we get to the dangers of normalizing political violence, aka &amp;ldquo;terrorism,&amp;rdquo; let&amp;rsquo;s remember a famous party.

In our hyper-emotional world of 2017, we are told to explore our emotions. Then act upon those emotions. Like poorly trained animals. Like half-wits. Like narcissists and spoiled brats. Like lower primates.
Like the KKK and BLM and Antifa thugs who turned that place into a thing yesterday.

                Angry texts.
I got a bunch of very angry texts this morning.
My friends are fired up. Because of Governor Greitens&amp;rsquo;s executive order. **An executive order that implements a novel approach to prescription drug databases. **
In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, Governor Greitens signed an executive order on July 17. The EO made Missouri the 50th state to establish some sort of prescription drug tracking.
Most states track everything about prescriptions.

                &amp;ldquo;Will Trump survive this?&amp;rdquo;
A friend of mine texted me yesterday. I had no idea what the &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; was. Later, I learned.
Turns out, like most of the media&amp;rsquo;s breathless revelations about Trump&amp;rsquo;s supposed crimes, the story that people reacted to meant little. The anti-Trump media exploded with fake news, fake interpretations of real news, and speculation that supported their own angry fetishes.
But any reasonable person would respond like my friend.

                You know it&amp;rsquo;s coming. Some fake news hack will claim the whole Foxconn-Wisconsin deal was a plot to find a new job for Reince Priebus.
Reince Priebus, the erstwhile White House chief of staff who prides himself on blocking deplorables from the White House posts they deserve, has been relieved of duties. He&amp;rsquo;s on his way back to native Wisconsin where Foxconn is building a $10 billion plant. Maybe Foxconn needs an establishment-connected middle manager.

I support Trump because he&amp;rsquo;s a fighter. He&amp;rsquo;s a man of action. Trump prosecutes his causes, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t navel gaze.
Jeff Sessions is a good man. He&amp;rsquo;s a good Washington man. He has standards of decorum. Standards I admire.
Trump has no standards of decorum. But I voted for Trump because history has made decorum a liability, even a vice.

It&amp;rsquo;s our nature. Our herding response gave our species an advantage. The herders lived to breed. The wanderers, the stragglers, fell prey. Genes of herders increased. Genes of loners receded.

 Freedom begins with understanding what we control and we do not. Yet very few people even begin to consider this essential dichotomy.
Even in the complete absence of &amp;ldquo;administration&amp;rdquo; as Tocqueville observed in early 19th century America, no one was free who failed to understand Epictetus&amp;rsquo;s control dichotomy: some things are under our control, some are not.

                To liberals, the murder of a Republican is like the swatting of a mosquito. They oppose violence in theory, but they also want the pest dead. They&amp;rsquo;re just too lazy to get out of their easy chairs to do it themselves.
Cass Sunstein, a leftist who&amp;rsquo;s happy whenever a conservative dies early, wrote a book called Nudge. It&amp;rsquo;s a good psychology book. Nudge is about persuasion, which is my chief interest.

&amp;ldquo;No obstruction. No collusion. He&amp;rsquo;s a leaker.&amp;rdquo;
That&amp;rsquo;s how Trump summarized Comey&amp;rsquo;s testimony to the Senate&amp;rsquo;s Russian Conspiracy Hoax Committee.

Scott is a genius in persuasion and psychology. Everything he just said about Trump&amp;rsquo;s linguistic kill-shot is dead-on accurate. Trump destroyed Comey without firing a shot. &amp;ldquo;No obstruction. No collusion.

 Because of tolerance, it’s getting harder and harder to make people laugh with Trump jokes. Everybody’s heard them all. So comedians have to ramp up the shock factor. And they have been. And it was working.
 Until Kathy Griffin went too far.

Seth Rich was murdered. Two gunshots to his back. Like you&amp;rsquo;d see on The Sopranos (video). The police called it a robbery. But nothing was stolen. Not his cell phone. Not his wallet. Not his watch. Not his cash.
Shortly after his murder, Wikileaks posted embarrassing emails. Emails from the Democratic National Committee&amp;rsquo;s email server. Wikileaks maintains that the theft of the emails was an inside job.

For those of you who do not follow things as mundane as television rating scores, you may be surprised to learn that Fox News Channel (FNC) is losing its lead as the powerhouse in primetime cable TV ratings to MSNBC. There are a couple of reasons why.
First, control of FNC has been transferred to two brothers, Lachlan and James Murdoch, who do not believe in the political message espoused by Fox for the last twenty years.

                Do you follow the recommended diets? Low fat. High carbohydrate? Eat lots of fruit?
If so, you&amp;rsquo;re probably overweight. And your blood tests are probably a mess. Maybe your doctor recommends expensive prescriptions to lower your cholesterol.
A new study finds the problem is not your fault. Your doctor, poorly educated in nutrition, and government recommendations, prompted by industry lobbyists, are designed to keep you fat and sick. And it&amp;rsquo;s not just US government.

** Trump is Hitler: dead ** Trump is a Russian agent: dead ** Trump is incompetent: dying ** Trump is a lightweight among world leaders: dead
In other words, it took 59 cruise missiles to blow up the left&amp;rsquo;s anti-Trump narratives.

                Susan Rice admitted she lied. She requested unmaskings of Trump associates.
Rice says her unmasking requests were routine. Maybe they were.
We can find out. It&amp;rsquo;s simple data analysis. I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how. But, first, you have to know the right question to ask. And few people do.
Right Questions You hear a lot of talk about whether Susan Rice requested unmasking of Trump associates. That&amp;rsquo;s a good question, but it&amp;rsquo;s not enough.

                Now you know. You can stop doubting. You have more than hope.
The Obama administration spied on Donald Trump and his campaign and transition teams. There is no longer any doubt.
The questions that remain are:
** Who ordered and authorized the illegal wiretaps? ** Who illegally received and disseminated the intelligence? ** What did Obama know?
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to declare the Obama Admin guilty after Evelyn Farkas&amp;rsquo;s admissions on MSNBC.

                I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my mind on priority.
Instead of going to tax reform next, President Trump should work on that big-league infrastructure bill. Now. Fast.
President Trump needs a big win because power is in perception. He also needs to put Democrats in a bind. Plus, he needs to prove he can pass big legislation without all GOP factions on board.
The solution is infrastructure.
During the campaign, Trump spoke of a massive building project to rejuvenate our roads, modernize our airports, and more.

 Imagine you are standing at a dangerous intersection now. Cars whizzing by nonstop in all 4 directions. You feel powerless and frustrated. There are no structural safeguards, no physical barriers, to keep us from getting hit. There is a crossing guard, though.

That same thing happened to Obamacare over the years. It&amp;rsquo;s now untouchable.

So it was born in a toxic environment. ** Then, Obamacare survived two Supreme Court rulings, each time by a single vote from the chief justice. ** Finally, Obamacare survived seven years of Republican promises to repeal it immediately upon winning the White House and Congress.

                General George S. Patton arrived in North Africa with a single mission: lead the Allied forces to victory over the Hun.
But Patton&amp;rsquo;s assignment was also in response to a miserable and deadly failure of leadership. The failed leadership of General Lloyd Fredendall.
 Fredendall was a Francophobe and an Anglophobe ill-suited to wage coalition warfare; a micromanager who bypassed the chain of command – giving orders as far down as company level; a coward, he allowed animus with subordinates to affect his judgment and undercut their authority; and finally, staring defeat in the face at Kasserine, he tried to pin the blame on others.

Lifer Republicans have no experience with games of chicken. They were raised on coordination games.
By changing the game to Chicken, Donald Trump greatly increased the chances that phony Paul Ryan&amp;rsquo;s healthcare will PASS.
Here&amp;rsquo;s why briefly.
Psychologically, people always think they have more time. Republicans, in particular, believe time is limitless. Lifelong Republicans think they can delay any decision until the decision they want is a given.

                President Donald Trump delivered his budget and a message for Congress.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m lazy, I&amp;rsquo;ll quote Time magazine.
First, the President&amp;rsquo;s message to Congress:
 &amp;ldquo;I urge the members of Congress to remember that last November the American people&amp;rsquo;s message was loud and clear. The mandate for change, expressed by the American people, was not my mandate; it was our mandate.&amp;rdquo;
 Then, the analysis:
 The President&amp;rsquo;s meaning was unmistakable: the public wants deep cuts in both spending and taxes, and any legislator who tries to keep the ax from falling risks putting his own neck under an ax at the polls.

Modern submarines have incredible passive sonar arrays. They can hear everything in the ocean for hundreds of miles around. Everything.
Everything except something directly behind them. Behind a submarine is a big propeller or &amp;ldquo;screw.&amp;rdquo; It turns. It pushes water abaft. The noise and the motion combine to prevent sound waves from reaching the sensors.

                John McCain may have done some heroic things, but he is a hero no more.
Imagine how you&amp;rsquo;d feel.
A knock on your door.
Through the deadlights around your front door, you see a car with government stencils on the side. When you get close enough, you look out and see a man in uniform. An officer. You know. You know why he&amp;rsquo;s here. Your throat tightens. You want to turn around and walk away.

In 2012, Barack Obama got caught telling Russian Prime Minister Medvedev that he&amp;rsquo;d have more &amp;ldquo;flexibility&amp;rdquo; after the election.
Later in 2012, during a debate, Obama accused GOP candidate Mitt Romney of stoking Cold War fears against our new friends in Moscow. Obama said, “The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because…the Cold War’s been over for 20 years!” In fact, in 2012, the whole pantheon of pantsuit partiersmocked warnings about Russia.

In 1966, Hollywood liberals made a very funny movie. The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming! The movie mocked Cold Warriors and ridiculed hyper-paranoia about the dangers posed by Russia.
Some of those same Hollywood liberals are now running around screaming &amp;ldquo;The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!&amp;rdquo;
Funny.

                You had to laugh. Claire McCaskill jumped on Twitter to announce she&amp;rsquo;d never met the Russian ambassador to the US. Before that, she jumped on Twitter to brag about being so damned important and vital that the Russian ambassador sought her oracle-like guidance.
After people mocked and scorned her silly lie, Claire McCaskill made up more lies to cover the first lie. You know, like a liar.
Senator McCaskill believes Jeff Sessions should resign for not telling a lie.

                The Concorde was a supersonic passenger plane. It shuttled people between New York and Paris very quickly.
When commercial Concorde flights began in 1976, the novelty and excitement of flying at twice the speed of sound led people to line up to take the flights. But after 27 years and several safety mishaps, the Concorde&amp;rsquo;s popularity waned. Flights were often less than half full, so British Airways, the operator, was losing money.

                Hate John McCain if you want. Call McCain a traitor, even.
I look at John McCain and marvel at his strength. Many do.
Everyone knows about McCain being shot down over Vietnam and spending 5 years in a POW camp. But most people don&amp;rsquo;t know about the deep emotional scar McCain brought home with him. And that emotional scar undoubtedly drives him to his fits of anger and telling lies about people he doesn&amp;rsquo;t like.

You can imagine what it&amp;rsquo;s like be in a bad mood, can&amp;rsquo;t you? People go through periods of deep funk when nothing seems bright or cheerful, don&amp;rsquo;t they?
And when you&amp;rsquo;re in those moods, what&amp;rsquo;s the worst thing? That&amp;rsquo;s right, it&amp;rsquo;s being around a bunch of happy people having fun.

The President looked poised, cheerful, and humorous. He volleyed with Jim Acosta of CNN. He rated each question &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bad.&amp;rdquo; He explained why he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want a nuclear war with Russia because the press seems to think nuclear war is a good thing. He mocked those in the press who want him to bomb that Russian intel ship off Virginia.

One large chapter of history ends, and another starts.
 In a very real sense, one society dies— and another is born.

Okay. Let&amp;rsquo;s call them that.
Author Steven Pressfield wrote a book about defeating The Resistance. It&amp;rsquo;s called The War of Art, and it&amp;rsquo;s an awesome, wonderful book.
Overcoming and defeating The Resistance, Pressfield tells us, is the key to living the good life. I agree, even if I don&amp;rsquo;t agree on some of his enemies.

Imagine yourself surrounded on all sides by angry faces dressed in shabby clothes, some faces covered with bandanas or ski masks. People are chanting something you can&amp;rsquo;t quite understand, like a private joke you&amp;rsquo;re not allowed to get. Or maybe they&amp;rsquo;re chanting at you.

Seventy-five percent of murder victims in Chicago are black.
Immediately, leftists, who apparently enjoy all the carnage in Chicago, attacked Trump&amp;rsquo;s call for fewer shootings and murders.

But the press corps and many Americans have a psychosis that literally replaces some words with other words. It&amp;rsquo;s not dyslexia. It&amp;rsquo;s far worse because it&amp;rsquo;s selective.
In this case, Spicer said &amp;ldquo;witness&amp;rdquo; but journalists everywhere repeated, &amp;ldquo;attend.&amp;rdquo; I wrote about it here.
Well, today, Spicer explained the situation to a psychotic journalist almost the same way I did.

                When your brain automatically alters perceptions, there&amp;rsquo;s something wrong with you.
Reporters have this psychosis. Journalists. They have very bad ADHD it seems. They can&amp;rsquo;t pay attention. Like kids with ADHD. Chuck Todd and everybody at Business Insider should probably take Ritalin or something.
Reporters are also narcissists. No one goes into journalism unless they have a pathologically inflated ego. No one.
So I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk you through the proof, slowly, so even our narcissistic, hyperactive, attention-deficit-disordered journalists can understand that Sean Spicer played with them like a cat pawing a dying moth.

                A Good Samaritan was shot and killed and three shot in a &amp;ldquo;robbery gone very wrong&amp;rdquo; at Rolling Oaks Mall in San Antonio, Texas Sunday afternoon about 3:30 p.m. Two others transported to hospitals with other medical conditions. One suspect is still at large and assumed armed and dangerous.
The dead man was a shopper who attempted to stop two robbers after they robbed a Kay Jewelers store in the mall.

The crooked press and the corrupt establishment, while dissing Trump publicly, scoffed privately. They &amp;ldquo;knew&amp;rdquo; his supporters were idiots and yahoos—marginally functional Neanderthals from America&amp;rsquo;s unreconstructed backwoods whose ability to think, handicapped by genetics, was further crippled by the moonshine distilled in the shed behind their putrid outhouse for personal consumption by their incest-ridden family of knuckle-dragging racist homophobes.

Jim was in the crowd at the very first Tea Party in St. Louis, February 27, 2009. A cold Friday. He and more than a thousand other folks took off work and school to see what this protest was all about. Like so many others, Jim knew America needed a change. A big one. A change built on the hopes and dreams and fierce independence of ordinary people.

In high school (and after) we mocked the kids who took shop. The &amp;ldquo;greasers&amp;rdquo; who got credit for wrenching on cars or welding or making cabinets. It was the 1980s and shop, along with home economics, became an elective in most schools.
Until the 80s, some practical life skill class was a requirement at most American public and parochial high schools.

The Tea Party movement was an antagonistic movement. We opposed bad stuff. We sought punishment for bad actors. We saw that the experts were wrong, and we pointed out their folly. Like William F. Buckley&amp;rsquo;s charter for National Review, we stood athwart history, yelling &amp;ldquo;STOP!&amp;rdquo; At its heart, the Tea Party movement opposed a corrupt and insulated establishment class.

The Wall Street Journal seems to agree with my conclusion: a coup attempt is going on in America. Rogue actors within the CIA, all of the major leftist media (New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS), and probably major defense contractors seem to be involved, though the Wall Street Journal stops short of accusing advertisers.

One of those powerful interests is the Central Intelligence Agency. One of the CIA&amp;rsquo;s own, Evan McMullin, attempted to disrupt the election. Like Bay of Pigs and Saddam&amp;rsquo;s weapons of mass destruction, that CIA plot failed. Even George Will admits the CIA makes some horrible, deadly mistakes.

In the month since the election on November 8, America burst out of the longest economic malaise since the Great Depression.

President Trump won&amp;rsquo;t take office until Friday, January 20, 2017. Today is December 8, 2016.

                Jill Stein has raised nearly $7 million in an effort to overturn election results in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. She has no chance of winning any of those states, and Hillary Clinton has joined Team Stein.
So what&amp;rsquo;s the point?
Apparently,Stein and Clinton want the recounts to miss their December 19 deadline. December 19 is the Constitutionally mandated Electoral College vote. If the recounts are incomplete on the 19th, voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania will be disenfranchised, no candidate will have 270 electoral votes, and the election will be thrown to the US House of Representatives.

“That won’t be necessary. I’m afraid I’ll have to place you on suspension until the board reviews your case.

While you should read all of The Fourth Turning by generational historians William Strauss and Neil Howe, here&amp;rsquo;s one of their predictions for this point in time. The prediction was published in 1997:
 The economy will in time recover from its early and vertiginous reversals. Late in the Crisis, with trust and hope and urgency growing fast, it may even achieve unprecedented levels of efficiency and production.

Anyone who says &amp;ldquo;states&amp;rsquo; rights&amp;rdquo; needs a basic course in political philosophy.
For years, a few conservatives mistakenly defended &amp;ldquo;states&amp;rsquo; rights&amp;rdquo; when they meant to say &amp;ldquo;federalism.&amp;rdquo; When conservatives made this error, the left jumped all over them.

“I’m Roger Thompson. My son David was brought here,” he said.

Once upon a time, &amp;ldquo;the United States of America&amp;rdquo; was a plural noun. (I&amp;rsquo;ll prove it to you in a moment.) Careful writers and speakers would say &amp;ldquo;the United States are .

                Guest Post by Lee A. Presser
My friend Bill Hennessy wrote an excellent 11-12-16 blog analysis of Anglo-American history and how it relates to Mr. Trump’s victory (https://hennessysview.com/2016/11/12/how-the-second-born-twin-can-be-older-than-the-first/). After reading that blog I phoned him to add a tangential thought. Bill suggested I share the thought with you.
It took 561 years (from the Magna Carta to the Declaration of Independence) for the idea of limited government and political equality to infuse itself into Anglo-American culture.

If you&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about policy, you&amp;rsquo;re thinking really, really small. Trump&amp;rsquo;s influence is way bigger. Here are three ways Trump will change America for a generation.

                Have you ever noticed that twins have a pecking order? Even identical twins born minutes apart show a subtle seniority complex. Usually the first-born twin leads the second-born.
Makes you wonder how these Peterson twins will relate to each other, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?
Because of the time change at the end of daylight saving time, the second-born twin is officially older than the first. That&amp;rsquo;ll be interesting to watch. And if you find yourself pondering the oddness of those twins&amp;rsquo; birth order, you can easily find yourself pondering America&amp;rsquo;s little sister relationship to the UK.

                Adam Carolla noticed something I didn&amp;rsquo;t.
Carolla&amp;rsquo;s first reaction to the election results was this. Hillary Clinton built herself a Logan&amp;rsquo;s Run type palace for her would-be coronation. Donald Trump accepted the presidency in a room that might double as a Hometown Buffet.
Put another way, here&amp;rsquo;s what the winner&amp;rsquo;s auditorium:

                Sometimes I forget what originally drove me to call for a tea party protest in St. Louis.
One motivation was fear of missing out because a dozen other cities were planning protests. Another driver was a desire change the direction of the country. And at least some of it was the frustrated actor in me looking for an outlet.
Since two-thirds of those motivations appeal only to me, let’s focus on the middle one: change the country.

                A few people have called me tonight to ask my prediction on the election. They know I&amp;rsquo;ve predicted a Trump landslide. They want to know if I stand by it.
My answer: blank slate.
I have no expectations. None. I have preferences, but no expectations.
It&amp;rsquo;s kind of silly to expect something you have little or no control over. I have no control over James Comey or Loretta Lynch, much less the millions of American and non-Americans who will vote.

                You might be stressing out when you learn that James Comey sent another letter to Congress. In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t hear, he did. And he said that the emails found on Huma Abedin&amp;rsquo;s computer did not change his earlier conclusion about Hillary Clinton.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to panic or get mad or dejected. Totally understandable. But that&amp;rsquo;s totally counterproductive, too. And being mad or acting dispirited is just what the elites want us to do.

Remember August 2015? It was hot, of course, but everybody was talking about when Trump would fade. For example, here&amp;rsquo;s the RCP Afternoon Edition from August 7, the day after the first GOP debate:
 Whose Party Is It, Anyway? - Molly Ball, The Atlantic The Republican Debate Was Awesome - David Harsanyi, The Federalist You Cannot Embarrass Donald Trump - Ezra Klein, Vox The Beginning of the End for Trump - Ed Rogers, Washington Post Martin O&amp;rsquo;Malley, the Dems&amp;rsquo; Fallback?

A lot of people thought I was nuts, that I was reading too much into the White House statement that discredited Hillary&amp;rsquo;s primary talking point about James Comey.

                Since its revelation in WikiLeaks two weeks ago, Donna Brazile has been justly excoriated for cheating on behalf of Hillary Clinton by passing along a debate question.
However, an important aspect to this story has been overlooked. As the saying goes, it takes two to tango. Yes, Donna Brazile sent a critically beneficial piece of information - but Hillary Clinton accepted it.
Mrs. Clinton accepted it (stealing), used it (cheating), and said nothing (lying).

From Bill Richardson to Robby Mook, Clinton surrogates are reciting a strange and disturbing talking point: Voters have &amp;ldquo;baked in&amp;rdquo; Clinton&amp;rsquo;s life of crime.
[FLASHBACK: I gave James Comey the benefit of the doubt in July]
The talking point seems meant to keep Democrats from panicking over the FBI&amp;rsquo;s re-opened criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.

Every election since 1960 has involved massive election rigging by Democrats. They laugh about it privately and act all offended by the accusation in public.
Republicans let it happen. Republicans like John McCain believe they have a &amp;ldquo;duty&amp;rdquo; to concede even if an election is rigged. They called &amp;ldquo;honorable.&amp;rdquo; But conceding a rigged election is actually a moral failing.

                Some people have already decided which candidate to vote for. According to polls, slightly more people favor the psychopath over the braggart.
For the undecided, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d create a simple quiz that will tell you whether you&amp;rsquo;re more comfortable with a President who says ugly things and brags about accomplishments or a president who gets people killed and gives away national secrets for cash. I know, it&amp;rsquo;s a tough call.

                Have you ever met someone who&amp;rsquo;s just nasty? Mean? Self-centered? Treats &amp;ldquo;little people&amp;rdquo; like dirt?
If you answered &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to any of these questions, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably met Hillary Clinton. Hillary is likely a psychopath according to official FBI documents released Friday.
What is psychopathy? For the answer, let&amp;rsquo;s go to the book Almost a Psychopath (h/t Eric Barker):
 Psychopathy is a psychological condition in which the individual shows a profound lack of empathy for the feelings of others, a willingness to engage in immoral and antisocial behavior for short-term gains, and extreme egocentricity.

                Lying is tough business.
People believe lies with more details. Time, date, people, exact words, what people were wearing, sequences of events. All that. So liars usually provide some gripping details to make their lies more believable.
In casual conversation, this works. Once some sucker buys your lie, you&amp;rsquo;re pretty much in the clear. The problem comes when you broadcast your lie for maximum coverage. The more people who hear the lie, the more people try to verify those details.

Hillary Clinton told us Trump won the debate with her final answer. Final answer.
An audience member asked the closing question. He challenged the candidates to say something nice about their opponents. Hillary went first.
The right way to answer those screwball questions is to say something nice and sit down. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why in a moment.

Trump countered with a similar answer. But Trump could have crippled Hillary with a single line:

 WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government has mistakenly granted citizenship to at least 858 immigrants who had pending deportation orders from countries of concern to national security or with high rates of immigration fraud, according to an internal Homeland Security audit released Monday.
 The Homeland Security Department’s inspector general found that the immigrants used different names or birthdates to apply for citizenship with U.

CEO Locus of Control In a series of studies, researchers found that companies whose CEO displayed an external locus of control were 650 percent more likely to fail than similar companies whose CEO showed an internal locus of control (source).

As you watch the polls shift rapidly toward Trump, you might wonder what&amp;rsquo;s happening. What&amp;rsquo;s happening is completely natural, but it&amp;rsquo;s not normal. Elections don&amp;rsquo;t usually go this way. And two psychological phenomena are working to deliver the Trump landslide I predicted long ago.

At the end of that series, the Reds were in first place, a game ahead of the Phillies and 1.

  While most serious people dismissed the rumors about Clinton’s health that were being circulated by Donald Trump’s supporters, what happened Sunday morning will deepen suspicions both about her health and whether her campaign has been telling the truth about it.

                You might find yourself freaking out that NRA endorsed the Democrat for Missouri Governor instead of Republican Eric Greitens. If you think about it, though, the endorsement makes perfect sense from the NRA&amp;rsquo;s perspective.
You realize that the NRA is a lobbying firm, and lobbyists have an easier time working with an established asset like Koster than cultivating an outsider like Greitens. Recruiting and cultivating an asset is to a lobbyist as finding and selling a new customer is to a business.

Hillary lied.

 Clinton contacted former Secretary of State Colin Powell via e-mail to inquire about his use of a BlackBerry while he was Secretary of State .

                If this shocks you, you&amp;rsquo;re probably a racist. I probably am, too.
Blacks want the same things whites want. Well, blacks want the same things non-elitist whites want. And it&amp;rsquo;s been quantified. By a Jew. Here&amp;rsquo;s what he found, as reported by Business Insider:
 His report (featured below) found that black voters care most about lowering taxes in their community, having a strong leader, creating jobs, changing the tax code to help workers and small businesses, making college affordable, and improving the financial health of the US.

                Admit it: words trump action. And words trump results.
No one really cares what you do or the consequences of your actions. They care about what you say.
That&amp;rsquo;s what we learned in school, right? That action is cheap but words are priceless. You probably memorized this nursery rhyme:
 Verbs and nouns Can break our crowns But deeds can never hurt us.
 There was another nursery rhyme with the same meter and opposite meaning.

First, the gaffes.
You hear about Trump stepping on his own applause lines. He announced Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway the day after the best speech of his life (until then). He wondered aloud (via Twitter) what Mr.

                You probably remember that in September 1980 voters couldn’t wait to cast a vote for Reagan.
If you remember it like that, you remember wrong. At least a little wrong.
TIME magazine examined voter sentiment in its September 15, 1980, issue. Voters that year sounded a lot like voters this year. Here’s how TIME’s Ed Magnuson summarized the voters of 1980:
 Disenchanted, but not apathetic. Caring about issues, although much more concerned about character.

America’s fiscal year is October 1 to September 30. With two month left in FY16, the U.S. Treasury has already paid creditors $380,925,428,211.67 in interest costs. (That’s $381 Billion) https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm
The average interest rate was just over 2%. https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/pd/avg/2016/2016_07.htm
 It is expected that the last two month’s of this fiscal year, interest costs will increase another $45 to $66 Billion. The total FY16 interest cost may be between $426 and $447 Billion.

                France’s population had changed considerably since 1614. The non-aristocratic members of the Third Estate now represented 98 percent of the people but could still be outvoted by the other two bodies. In the lead-up to the May 5 meeting, the Third Estate began to mobilize support for equal representation and the abolishment of the noble veto–in other words, they wanted voting by head and not by status. While all of the orders shared a common desire for fiscal and judicial reform as well as a more representative form of government, the nobles in particular were loath to give up the privileges they enjoyed under the traditional system.

                You might be wondering why the Missouri Farm Bureau endorsed Democrat Chris Koster instead of Republican Eric Greitens. The Farm Bureau endorses Republicans about 99% of the time.
If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking it had to do with policy or personality, you&amp;rsquo;re thinking wrong. (And, no, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t because of Koster&amp;rsquo;s hair, Mark Reardon.) This was all about the establishment vs. the people. It&amp;rsquo;s about power and control. Greitens threatens the establishment.

                Why did Trump beat Ted Cruz? Probably the biggest reason is that Trump talks purpose while Cruz talks policy and principles.
When people hear Trump, they hear a purpose that aligns with their purpose. I know I do. And it&amp;rsquo;s similar to the purpose Arthur C. Brooks explained in his great book, The Conservative Heart.
Ted Cruz never seemed to have a purpose, just policies and principles. Cruz spoke of abstract principles and left it to the people to figure out if those principles would make their lives better or worse.

Eric Greitens gave up a morning of this campaign to talk to one of my kids. That kid is a man now. He&amp;rsquo;s in the Navy at a helo combat squadron in San Diego.

I got home from door knocking for Eric at about 6:30 and walked straight to my laptop to write. Just as I sat down, my wife called me to dinner. She&amp;rsquo;d already eaten, but she heated up my dinner, called to me, then walked into our living room and shrieked.

                Some people have a loud opinion on each and every Republican Primary race.
I have a lot of opinions, but I like to focus on a few key races. Here are my major concerns for the 2016 Republican Primary on August 2.

                From Dr. Ben Carson:
   President Obama and his allies are trying to hijack the Republican primary in Missouri by attacking my good friend Eric Greitens.
    Like me, Eric is a conservative outsider, and that means the political establishment is terrified of him. Obama and his allies are now spending a million dollars falsely attacking Eric Greitens and trying to fool the people of Missouri.

If you&amp;rsquo;re a Republican and you follow the advice of the Democratic Governors Association, you won&amp;rsquo;t vote for Eric Greitens. The DGA wants Democrat Chris Koster to win, so Democrats are telling Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Republicans not to nominate Greitens. Democrats believe Greitens beats Koster in November.

**Holzer has damaged Brunner&amp;rsquo;s reputation and credibility. **And Brunner spent a ton of his own money in the process, including paying $100,000 to the guy who made the video, then squealed about it.

                Contrasts.
Two Politico stories, just weeks apart, demonstrate the remarkable contrasts between the two candidates for president.
The headline of the Trump story tells it all:
 Trump raised $32 million with RNC, but kept only a fraction.
 And the Hillary story:
 Leaked emails show officials tried to obscure the fact that Clinton allowed states to keep only a tiny fraction of proceeds from joint fundraising.
 Trump is on Team America.

The Pledge thing is a goodly part of it.

The Pledge promised support, including data, from the RNC in exchange for Ted Cruz&amp;rsquo;s endorsement of the eventual nominee.

A lot of people are saying Trump shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have invited him to speak unless Cruz agreed to endorse Trump. But Trump didn&amp;rsquo;t even ask for Cruz&amp;rsquo;s endorsement. Trump just offered Ted the prime time spot, and Ted took it.

Maybe Mr. Trump read my book Turning On Trump. That&amp;rsquo;s probably where he got the idea for this entrance. Part 3 of Turning On Trump is &amp;ldquo;Trump, The Champion.&amp;rdquo; You should read the book and find out why it&amp;rsquo;s had so much influence.

                Hillary, Obama, and much of the Democrat Party have fomented race hatred for years. They&amp;rsquo;ve ratcheted up their lies in recent months, hoping to turn race hatred into votes. They are that cynical and self-serving.
Now, Hillary and Obama have lost control of the fire they started. Crazed, racist murderers all across the country have declared war on police officers. From Dallas, Texas, to Ballwin, Missouri, to Baton Rouge, Louisianna, Hillary has sent a message that says it&amp;rsquo;s okay to kill a cop.

I don&amp;rsquo;t look at Facebook too often. I have been on Facebook lately because it&amp;rsquo;s a great vehicle for book sales, but I really don&amp;rsquo;t like it.
One problem with Facebook is that I can see what people are thinking. And so many people I know and respect think some really dumb things.

One of the reasons Trump will win in a landslide is safety. Trump has warned for years that we are weak and political correctness makes us weaker. Everybody knows he&amp;rsquo;s right. NeverTrumpers were saying this until Trump said it.
Last night,** a Muslim terrorist killed at least 84 people in Nice, France**. They were ordinary people lined up to watch fireworks, the same way you did on the 4th of July.

                I believe the greatest threat to human freedom and thriving is the political class. That smirking political class infects both Washington, DC, and Jefferson City, Missouri.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg, aka Notorious RBG, made a wish last week. Being a lawyer, her wish came with a contingency.
I just launched a GoFund.Meproject to grant her that wish. And why not?
Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a true Horatio Alger story. Born to Russian-Jewish immigrant parents, raised in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, RBG rose the highest legal position in the United States: Supreme Court Justice.

Up until now, one complaint of the NeverTurmpers has been that Mr. Trump will hurt Republicans running for Senate, the House, and state offices. They make this claim knowing full well that Trump is ahead of Romney in every poll and with every demographic group. I predict that, come October, people will be saying Trump is virtually running unopposed.

                When a person declares himself &amp;ldquo;NeverTrump,&amp;rdquo; he thinks he&amp;rsquo;s making a political statement. Or a moral one. But he&amp;rsquo;s not. He&amp;rsquo;s making a psychological commitment that&amp;rsquo;s very difficult and painful to break.
Identity is the highest, most powerful form of persuasion. Identity also drives our decisions in parts of the brain we don&amp;rsquo;t really have conscious control over.

You probably think you know why you’re mad at him. For instance, you might not like what he said about the judge in a lawsuit he’s involved with.

                I sent one email to Jamie Allman. He&amp;rsquo;s such a great guy, he invited me on two of his shows. Probably not because of me, but because of the subject of Turning On Trump. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s an honor. Thank you, Jamie.
If you&amp;rsquo;re as curious about Turning On Trump as Jamie Allman is, listen to his show on97.1 FM Tuesday, July 5 at 7:20 a.m. We&amp;rsquo;ll wait while you make a note to listen.

Where did you get news of this latest terrorist attack? Facebook? Television? Radio?

When I was a freshman in college, a professor told me he saw George Will speak. He found Will&amp;rsquo;s conservatism &amp;ldquo;intellectual and reasonable,&amp;rdquo; unlike Ronald Regan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;extremism.&amp;rdquo; It was a shot at my Reaganism. I knew it.

                When the BBC called Brexit for LEAVE at about 12:30 a.m. CDT today, I thought first of my friend Mike Flynn. Mike had a keen sense of history. He put the Tea Party movement into proper perspective, as he did with all events. Mike kept us from overstating both the Tea Party&amp;rsquo;s effect and its potential. Or he put them in context and reminded us that our potential depends on ourselves, not outside forces.

                As an American, I am proud of the people from whose loins our nation sprang. United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union. The Brits rejected globalist, elitist threats and insults to vote for independence. Like America did in 1776.
Savor this moment in history. You were alive to see a nation reject foreign tyranny. Every Brit who voted LEAVE showed courage and love of freedom. God bless them all.

                Some people say they&amp;rsquo;re afraid of Donald Trump for bizarre reasons. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard he&amp;rsquo;s a dictator, a fascist, a genocidal maniac, and a lousy businessman. If any of that is true, there&amp;rsquo;s no evidence of it, so he must also own all the media already. And the internet. In fact, if Trump is a lousy businessman who managed to bungle his way to a $10 billion fortune, he must really bad at dictatoring, because he hasn&amp;rsquo;t even conquered his home country in 70 years.

Corey Lewandowski, the obscure, small-potatoes political operative from a tiny state couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly run a presidential campaign from start to victory, could he?
But this isn&amp;rsquo;t about Corey Lewandowski. It&amp;rsquo;s about the next the president of the United States, Donald Trump. And you&amp;rsquo;ll want to read it all because it&amp;rsquo;s so true. So true.

See, I experiment with every writing tool I hear about, and I stick with the ones that measurably improve my writing. Especially when they work as I write (because I hate editing and revision, as you can tell).

There are about 320 million people in the United States. About one percent are Muslims. By comparison, about 2.5 percent of Americans are Jewish. It&amp;rsquo;s safe to say, then, that there are about 2.

                A lot of people are mad at Paul Ryan. Millions of people want Mr. Ryan to step down as Speaker of the House. I am not mad at him. Paul Ryan is a victim of his circumstances, just like a lot of other Republicans.
Paul Ryan stepped up to a microphone this week and said what he was programmed to say. Essentially, Mr. Ryan said he&amp;rsquo;s not happy with Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s statements about a La Raza judge who started issuing anti-Trump rulings after Trump called on America to enforce its immigration laws.

                Republicans hate race. Race has been bad for the GOP ever since Republicans passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See, Lyndon Johnson was a Democrat, and he proposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Most Democrats violently opposed the bill. But most Republicans supported it. The bill passed, of course, and it survived many Supreme Court challenges.
The Civil Rights Act&amp;rsquo;s aim was to wring racist behavior out of American life.

                You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard the news that Donald Trump believes it&amp;rsquo;s possible for a Muslim judge to treat him unfairly. Do you think Trump is wrong about this?
When asked by a reporter if Trump believed it would be possible for a Muslim judge to treat him unfairly, Trump answered, &amp;ldquo;It’s possible, yes. Yeah. That would be possible, absolutely.&amp;rdquo;
Notice that Trump didn&amp;rsquo;t say, &amp;ldquo;all Muslim judges are unfair to me.&amp;rdquo; Nor did he say all Hispanic judges are unfair.

The leftist press is making hay over Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s reasonable assertion that a Muslim judge might not be able to fairly adjudicate a case involving Trump.
The answer to my opening question is &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo; Many judges have presided unfairly over trials. For example, many blacks were sent to prison when the same evidence would have exonerated a white defendant. We all know that.

If you supported Ted Cruz, you might not understand how the guy who wrote The Conservative Manifesto in 1993 could support Trump.
If you supported Marco Rubio or Ben Carson last year, how do you reconcile your convictions with Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s bizarre life?
Is Donald Trump a conservative or not?

Each generation looks at its wars and finds something final, but the end never comes. Memorials never end while man roams the earth.

Trump reached 1,237 delegates today, clinching the nomination of the Republican Party. He will be the 45th President of the United States, and his press conferences will be the most popular show on television. It will be huge, believe me. And after the press conference, Trump did something that might have sealed the deal with American voters.

                After the 1998 Rams season, I walked into City Limits bar or Brothers bar or whatever its name was then. It&amp;rsquo;s a strip mall bar in Wildwood. Cindy Schuenke was tending bar, and we started talking about the Rams&amp;rsquo; dismal season. She said they were hopeless, but I disagreed. &amp;ldquo;They are four players away,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;A quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a defensive end.&amp;rdquo;
Later in the year, but before the season, the Rams acquired Trent Green (and Kurt Warner) at QB, Marshall Faulk at RB, Adam Timmermann at offensive guard, and Grant Wistrom moved up to start at defensive end.

Lately, though, most of that &amp;ldquo;principles&amp;rdquo; talk is about how Donald Trump has caused good conservatives to abandon their principles.
Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s true. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to believe it.
The one principle that many conservatives have abandoned and encouraged others to abandon: keeping your word.
The lead advocate for abandoning this principle of keeping one&amp;rsquo;s word is Jonah Goldberg of National Review and the American Enterprise Institute.

For example, on Sunday, May 1, I predicted Ted Cruz would suspend his campaign after getting trounced in Indiana. Two days later, Cruz lost the Indiana primary to Donald Trump 53 to 36. At the time I wrote, many pundits and pollster still believed Cruz could win that Indiana race, and everyone believed Cruz was telling the truth when he said repeatedly he was staying in the race to Cleveland unless Trump reached 1,237 delegates before then.

House Speaker Paul Ryan has set aside Thursday for meetings with his party&amp;rsquo;s nominee for President. Every nominee for president meets with the senior members of his party&amp;rsquo;s Congressional caucus, so there&amp;rsquo;s nothing odd about the meeting.

Contrasts and comparisons.

Last July and August and once in September, I was down on Donald Trump. I predicted that a Trump nomination would be the last nail in the coffin of conservatism.

                Every prediction about Trump has been wrong. Except for two. Ann Coulter and Scott Adams predicted Trump would win the nomination and, eventually, the White House in a landslide. They were right.
World leaders expect Trump to win, and they are lining up to make all his crazy assertions look like brilliant predictions.
Former Mexico president Vicente Fox apologized to Trump, and Trump graciously accepted. That&amp;rsquo;s a sign that Mexicans expect Trump to become the next US president.

                If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever cheated on your spouse just to get back at your daughter for dating or marrying the wrong man, you&amp;rsquo;re probably a #nevertrump person like George Will.
Suppose your daughter married a man you didn&amp;rsquo;t approve of. You would probably respond by cheating on your own spouse, would you not? Having an affair would teach your daughter a lesson, right? And if your spouse and your friends and your other children suffered, too bad.

Koop wanted to curtail the spread of AIDS. The Safe Sex movement started slowly and originally focused on non-monogamous gay men. By 1987, though, everyone was doing it. (Or not doing &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; as the case may be.) A February 17, 1987 New York Times headline declared &amp;ldquo;Safe Sex Movement Gains Favor Among Heterosexuals.

After a so-so debate performance and in the middle of a 16-hour verbal assault from Marco Rubio, Trump went nuclear. But not the way everyone would expect Trump to go nuclear.
Trump didn&amp;rsquo;t need to invent a brilliant new put-down line to counter Marco. Instead, he calmly introduced Chris Christie to 10,000 fans in Texas.

I&amp;rsquo;m going to lay out some assumptions, many of which you could disagree with. That&amp;rsquo;s okay. But for the purposes of this post, let&amp;rsquo;s stipulate:

                Who would have thought that Pat Buchanan would become the spokesman for Generation X?
I put a lot of stock into generational history. I am a big fan of Howe and Strauss, a pair of historians whose works include Generations: The History of America&amp;rsquo;s Future, 13ers: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?, Millennials Rising, and, my favorite, The Fourth Turning.
As someone born in the 13th generation of Americans, more commonly called Generation X after the book by Douglas Coupland, I am overly captivated by that generation.

I’m with Apple on this one.
This back door would allow the FBI to access the content of the San Bernardino terrorists’ phone, possibly exposing more terrorists. That would be a good thing.
But Apple never built a back door to the iPhone because no one can control the keys to such portals. If Apple builds it, every government spy agency in the world will be able to read your texts, see where you’ve been, and listen to your phone calls.

I can only assume the Pope has secretly cut a deal with The Donald.

&amp;ldquo;Just, uh, call me a Muslim or something. Make it look sincere, ya know?&amp;rdquo;

Surface thinkers ignored most of the content. I warned you about this early on. I decided against a deep examination of conservatism because people don&amp;rsquo;t care. Instead, I wrote a rather tongue-in-cheek story about why definitions of conservatism don&amp;rsquo;t matter.
Deep thinkers got the tongue-in-cheek shtick. Maybe they rolled their eyes at my cheap attempt at being clever.

Figuring out whether Greitens is a conservative or not requires a lot of thinking, a lot of writing, and a lot of clear analysis from readers. I won&amp;rsquo;t waste time on the first two because I won&amp;rsquo;t get the last no matter what.

The American people get to decide who moves into the United States. If immigrants are coming for a free meal, we don’t need them. If immigrants are coming for free healthcare, we don’t need them. If immigrants are coming for free housing, we don’t need them. If immigrants are coming and their presence in the United States increases the public debt, we definitely don’t need them.
If immigrants come here to improve their lives and the lives of their family members WITHOUT becoming a burden on American society, we will seriously consider their application.

                I re-read Ronald Reagan&amp;rsquo;s announcement speech the other day.
Delivered November 13, 1979, these are the words that launched the greatest presidency of my lifetime.
Notice the natural humanity in Reagan&amp;rsquo;s words. He didn&amp;rsquo;t browbeat people with abstract concepts like the Constitution or liberty. Instead, he spoke about the real lives of ordinary Americans. And the everyday life of an America that lived up to its ideal. And notice the complete lack of pomposity, vanity, and vulgarity so prevalent in the frontrunners of 2016.

Those philosophical and political founders interpreted and organized ancient philosophy for England and America.

**If we don&amp;rsquo;t hold candidates accountable during the race when we have all the leverage, how can we possibly hold office-holders accountable? **

                **Expectations matter most in how undecided voters decide. **
It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand how late-deciders tend to vote. This knowledge (especially in Iowa and New Hampshire) could decide the outcome.
Primary voters tend to decide whom to for at the last minute.
In 2008, 16 percent of voters said they made their choice on election day. Which means we have a long way to go to know how Iowa will turn out.

Senator Cruz said, &amp;ldquo;Katrina Pierson is an utterly fearless principled conservative.&amp;rdquo;
That was just two years ago. Katrina Pierson was challenging Pete Sessions for Congress.

                Men by their constitutions are naturally divided into two parties: 1. Those who fear and distrust the people, and wish to draw all powers from them into the hands of the higher classes. 2. Those who identify themselves with the people, have confidence in them, cherish and consider them as the most honest and safe, although not the most wise depositary of the public interests. In every country these two parties exist, and in every one where they are free to think, speak, and write, they will declare themselves.

Before Star Wars, the 1970s were about killer sharks, towering infernos, earthquakes, and capsized cruise ships.
Psychologists and sociologists attributed the genre&amp;rsquo;s popularity to the people&amp;rsquo;s need to assimilate nuclear holocaust.
I think the movies were just good, cathartic entertainment.

Last year, Senator Schmitt became the champion of responsible local government with SB-5, a bill designed to end &amp;ldquo;taxation by citation&amp;rdquo; in local governments.
This year, Senator Schmitt is back to close a loophole that some cities are exploiting to suck more money out of residents who can least afford it.

The acrimony created by Kroenke&amp;rsquo;s relocation request letter makes the situation in St. Louis untenable for the team and its owner. In short, Kroenke calls St. Louis a second-rate, economically depressed, crime-infest toilet of a city full of people so obsessed with baseball that no other sports franchise has the ability to compete for entertainment dollars.

One way to coordinate time in a city or a sea port was a time ball placed somewhere highly visible. People could use the ball to set their pocket watches, and use their pocket watches to set their other clocks.

The first five people who told me they supported Trump in 2015 also supported Ross Perot in 1992.
I realize it&amp;rsquo;s a tiny sample size. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that Donald Trump is the reincarnation of H. Ross Perot.

Where Did the Millennials Come From? Leaving biology out of it, it&amp;rsquo;s simple: 2016 will be the first election in which the entire Millennial cohort is old enough to vote. Plus Millennial-aged immigrants have increased their numbers.

I am a terrible father, a crappy husband (ask my ex-wives), and a difficult employee. I do a lot of things poorly. Most things, in fact. Especially the things I &amp;ldquo;have&amp;rdquo; to do. Authority irritates me.
While I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at following plans, I write a week&amp;rsquo;s worth of blogs on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The pattern keeps me sane. Or semi-sane. I supplement those when events warrant.

Capitalists are like children and free marketers are like their parents.
If the free marketers neglect their duties to feed, protect, teach, and discipline capitalists, some well-meaning but inept government agency will impose itself into the parenting role, destroying the lives of everyone involved and wasting trillions of tax dollars (borrowed from future generations) in the process.

The UN is already very large. Its last budget was $5.4 billion, and that represented a 2.9 percent reduction from the previous two years.

 The celebration of Thanksgiving is a celebration of plenty and appreciation of the abundance that has characterized the free enterprise, individualistic, capitalistic systems of the US.

 This is the best analysis of the war on terror that I have read. If we do not fight to win, we shouldn’t be in the fight. Winning the war on terror starts with 1) admitting there is a war on terror, 2) being willing to confront the enemy with force, 3) fighting to win the war rather than appease the enemy, and 4) do whatever it takes to protect Americans and their homeland.

But the St. Louis Post Dispatch has found that I may have been right on November 8. That&amp;rsquo;s when I made the outlandish comment that the whole race issue at Mizzou is actually an abortion issue. I suspected that Planned Parenthood&amp;rsquo;s vast lobbyist network is agitating leaders of left-leaning organizations trying to create general unrest.
**The manipulators would use campus racial unrest to demand restored privileges for Planned Parenthood.

When FDR sent the troops to fight World War 2, he sent them to win. Since 1945, the political class has not given America’s military that clear instruction when being sent to war. Political considerations have modified the goal of winning. In Korea, it was fight but do not anger the Chinese. In Viet Nam, it was fight but do not attack the enemy if they are standing on the other side of line drawn on a map.

Be Kind to Him, World My mom framed a column she read in the St. Louis Globe Democrat in about 1969, just about the time I started kindergarten. The Globe title was “Be Kind To Him, World,” but Dan Valentine’s orginal title was “Dear World.”
That column moved from place to place in our house most of the time I lived at home.

Barack Obama announced that he will veto any attempt by Congress to require background checks of Syrian refugees in an attempt to weed out ISIS terrorists. The President&amp;rsquo;s allegiances are now clear.
I heard Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) say that we must ensure proper screening in the wake of last Friday’s Islamic terrorist attack in Paris.
The House of Representatives is working on legislation to do just that: increase the likelihood that we will catch terrorist infiltraters before they reach American soil.

After the coordinated attacks by ISIS terrorists in Paris on Friday, expect the mayor come under intense pressure to change plans. News that at least one of the Paris attackers entered France from Serbia as a Syrian war refugee will only intensify the pressure on Slay.

The players and other African-American students at Mizzou believe they are victims of &amp;ldquo;systematic oppression&amp;rdquo; and they want Tim Wolfe to fix it simply by resigning.

Rep. Ann Wagner (HA-64) is the House Majority Whip. Her job is to know how every GOP member will vote on bills and to cut deals until House leadership gets the numbers it wants.
It&amp;rsquo;s unfathomable that a majority whip would not have seen the Kevin McCarthy meltdown coming long before the House Republican caucus met to nominate a candidate for speaker. But many accounts suggest that the Republican House leadership thought McCarthy had the votes up to the moment he withdrew.

No, Uber did not win the Metropolitan Taxicab Commission&amp;rsquo;s permission to operate. Instead, the ride-sharing service filed a federal anti-trade suit against the MTC.
In the first weekend, Uber X provided over 5,000 rides, mostly from people leaving bars between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. In other words, by defying the MTC, Uber X kept 5,000 drunk drivers off the road.

                What did Jefferson mean by “pursuit of happiness” as an unalienable right?
If you’ve heard it was a substitute for “property” because Jefferson feared Southerners would equate property with slaves, you heard wrong.
For weeks I have repeated a foundational belief of conservatism: every person deserves the dignity of meaningful work and the freedom to pursue happiness.
But what does it mean to pursue happiness? What did Jefferson mean? And why did Locke consider pursuit of happiness essential to liberty?

Eric Greitens will have some things to say. Perhaps he won&amp;rsquo;t say everything you want to hear. (It&amp;rsquo;s still 11 months until the primary.) But he&amp;rsquo;ll say things you need to hear.

It&amp;rsquo;s the story of Marienthal Austria.
Marienthal was a town in Austria that thrived thanks to a single employer. When the flax mill went out of business in 1932, Marienthal&amp;rsquo;s population became mostly unemployed.
Thanks to Austria&amp;rsquo;s liberal unemployment programs that replaced up to 90 percent of income, no one in Marienthal plunged into economic poverty as a result of the mill&amp;rsquo;s closing. But spiritual poverty was another story.

                Why is government involved in marriage at all? Taxes.
Brian Bollmann makes an excellent point about same-sex marriage.
Brian points out in this post that marriage is not a matter for government; contract law is. Government&amp;rsquo;s only concern in the case of a marriage is with its contractual implications:
 At some point in the short history of the United States (and certainly after the Civil War), state governments stepped onto the wall of separation and began getting involved in the religious institution of marriage in the appropriate area of protecting the rights to property – especially that of women.

I hear she&amp;rsquo;s losing a lot of support from Democrat Party insiders, at least in private. The DNC is meeting this week, and talk will likely surround an alternative Democrats can vote for.
While Republicans enjoy the Clinton meltdown, we might want to be careful what we wish for.

                There seems to be a certain air of inevitability that Trump will win the GOP nomination for President. According to a new poll, 57 percent of Republican voters expect that Trump will be the party&amp;rsquo;s candidate next year. Why is that important?
Expectations Beat Preferences It&amp;rsquo;s important because expectations are far better predictors of actual winners than preference polls. From a 2012 NY Times story by David Leonhardt:
 Over the last 60 years, poll questions that asked people which candidate they expected to win have been a better guide to the outcome of the presidential race than questions asking people whom they planned to vote for, the study found.

This was meant to be a fun exercise for people who spend too much time thinking about politics. Like the leaders-eat-last poll, this required hide, often dissatisfying choices. As a result, only six people completed the exercise which took up to a half hour.

                It&amp;rsquo;s sad that Donald Trump has inspired so many good conservatives to promote fantasies about the 14th Amendment.
The Supreme Court addressed the issue of birthright citizenship directly, and Mark Levin and Laura Ingram know it. They are Constitutional lawyers.
Both Levin and Ingraham are familiar with United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) which established, thoroughly, that citizenship by birth has been the law of the land since before the Declaration of Independence and was codified by the 14th Amendment.

Contrasts give greater clarity. Sinek’s contrast between military leadership and business leadership says a lot about the state of American business.

 Half a century after President Lyndon B. Johnson declared a war on poverty, the number of Americans living in slums is rising at an extraordinary pace.

A shooter confronted plain-clothes officers and opened fire. Officers returned fire, striking the suspect. The suspect is in critical, unstable condition in a local hospital. One officer was treated, but the severity and cause of his injury is unknown.
The shooting and at least one break-in of a business marred what had been peaceful commemorations of the death of Michael Brown.

Great question. History being what it is, we can&amp;rsquo;t spread them across time, only across government. So this week&amp;rsquo;s poll is a little fun.
The rules:
You must fill the next White House cabinet using only the current candidates for President. You do not know who the President or Vice President is, so assume it&amp;rsquo;s none of the current candidates.

Our principles dignify people with work that** produces value**. We leave them **free to pursue happiness**, which includes their work, their leisure, their learning, and their families.

                Did you ever see a movement grow?
Did you see the way it starts?
Did you feel it spread around you?
Did you hear it rustling the leaves and scraping the sidewalk?
Did you want to kill it?
The weird thing about movements is that opposition tends to strengthen them. Movements feed on hostility the way rats feed on garbage.
The way you kill a movement is infiltration and fragmentation.

It’s time to dissolve the MTC. It has served its purpose and outlived its usefulness. Like the riverboat commission of the 1850s.

                The Transportation Empowerment Act gives states control and funding for their roads. It is a far superior to the Highway Trust Fund, which is slush fund for pork projects.
Transportation Empowerment Act (TEA) from Senator Mike Lee would gradually shift federal gasoline taxes from Washington back to the states where they were collected without a Washington DC handling fee and without strings attached.
TEA embodies an idea I first heard from Ronald Reaganwhen he was governor of California.

                We&amp;rsquo;ve reached the end.
On Monday, we corrected disinformation about The Franklin Project.
Next, we looked at the historical conservative framework for national service.
Wednesday was a dissection of The Franklin Project&amp;rsquo;s Plan of Action (as distinguished from the group&amp;rsquo;s vision.)
Yesterday, we examined the consequences of ignoring the call for national service.
Today, we offer an oversimplified proposal for Missouri&amp;rsquo;s version of a national-service program. While inadequate, it is a start.

                In part 1 of this series, we clarified some misconceptions and falsehoods about the Franklin Project.
In part 2, we examined the debate on the right from 1990 with William F. Buckley and Milton Friedman.
Part 3 was a critique of the Franklin Project&amp;rsquo;s Plan of Action.
Today, we will look at the consequences should conservatives turn their backs on the concept of developing a service ethos in America.

                This is part three of a five-part series on national service. Part 1 introduced the controversy and corrected a major misconception. Part 2 looked at national service through the eyes of conservative giants, Milton Friedman, William F. Buckley, and Ronald Reagan.
So, what’s wrong with the Franklin Project? Plenty.
The Franklin Project promotes the idea of a renewed ethos of national service in America. It’s mission:
 The Franklin Project envisions a future in which a year of full-time national service—a service year—is a cultural expectation, a common opportunity, and a civic rite of passage for every young American.

First, answer this for yourself: would you vote for William F. Buckley Jr?
Milton Friedman on National Service My friend Lloyd Sloan points out that Milton Friedman disagreed with Buckley’s call for national service. It seems appropriate, then, to view the idea of a service ethos through the eyes of two champions of conservatism of the 20th century.

It begins making stuff up.
That “making stuff up” has become the chief form of amusement among those who oppose Eric Greitens for Governor.
The current fiction they advance has to do with an organization called The Franklin Project. The fiction advanced by a few Facebook warriors goes something like this: “The Franklin Project wants mandatory national service.

Barklage grew up in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, along with Peter Kinder. Barklage has been Kinder’s campaign consultant for years—all of Kinder’s races, as far as I know. They were a team. David Barlage was Peter Kinder’s chief of staff when Kinder was president pro tem of the Missouri Senate in 2002.

No one believes Greece will make good on the agreement, and Greece didn&amp;rsquo;t want the deal. Germany demanded it, and Greece surrendered. But Greece will default at some point. Then what? Will Germany send its army? Probably.

I was.

                Down in my former state of South Carolina, the legislature hastily voted to remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol building. That is their prerogative, and I take no offense at their move.
What I do worry about is the haste.
South Carolina’s action on the flag reflected a spasm instigated by the horrible deeds of a horrible man—an unthinkable crime and grave sin. I can understand how the murderer’s association with the flag would lead people to connect the flag to the murders.

                So how to reenergize the innovation diffusion machine? This is key: “A level playing field that does not favour incumbents over entrants. Many policy measures, from environmental to fiscal measures, are designed to favour incumbents.” More entry through startups and more exit by uncompetitive incumbents.
 &amp;ndash;JAMES PETHOKOUKIS, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE
The Metropolitan Taxicab Commission is a crony club for taxi company executives and their hospitality friends, and its primary purpose is to kill transportation innovation and thwart price competition.

                The world is even more fragile than it was in 2007. The big banks are bigger. Aggregate bank assets are concentrated in fewer hands. The bank derivatives books are much larger. Market liquidity is worse.

Well, ain’t that just dandy?
And it’s undeniably true. We were told that the 2008 financial meltdown was caused by entities that had grown too large: banks, insurance companies, corporations, derivitives.

                Debt is not a guarantee of future payments in full. Rather, it is a risk that creditors take, in hopes of maybe being paid tomorrow.
 The key word there is &amp;ldquo;risk.&amp;rdquo;
If you&amp;rsquo;re willing to take the risk, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a premium — in the form of interest.
But the downside of that risk is that you lose your money. And Greece just called Germany&amp;rsquo;s bluff.

                Greece has voted to reject the “troika&amp;rsquo;s” bailout terms. The people of Greece said “no” to the central banksters who encourage sovereigns to enslave themselves under mountains of debt.
The Greeks showed remarkable courage and resiliency, and their example could disrupt the entire international banking system. Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge:
 The Greek people have spoken and they said &amp;ldquo;OXI&amp;rdquo;! So congratulations Greece: for the first time you had the chance to tell the Troika, the unelected eurocrats, and the entire status quo establishment, not to mention all the banks, how you really felt and based on the most recent results, some 61% of you told it to go fuck itself.

Nothing.
Well, not nothing. All kinds of bad things happen to the economy. But nothing happens for two groups of people central to the whole debate: workers who get a bump to $15 and employers who have to bump to $15 an hour.
Most cities and states that have raised their minimum wage laws to $15 will phase in the increase over five years.

If we must respect (revere?) the erstwhile Bruce Jenner for self-identifying as a woman, we have to respect Rachel Dolezal for self-identifying as black.
Both voluntarily left the world of privilege, as it were, to join an underclass&amp;ndash;an identifiable minority. Jenner left manhood; Dolezal left whitehood.
The left doesn&amp;rsquo;t see it that way, though. Apparently, rejecting one&amp;rsquo;s biological sex is okay, but rejecting one&amp;rsquo;s biological race isn&amp;rsquo;t.

 Jefferson City, MO, May 29, 2015 - A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Senate Bill 672, passed by the Missouri General Assembly in 2014, was filed in Cole County circuit court on May 29th.
 The lawsuit claims that the General Assembly ignored the constitutional limits to their legislative authority. The Missouri Constitution includes clauses that prohibit legislators from changing the purpose of a bill, including multiple subjects in one bill, or passing a “special law” that fails to treat everyone equally.

The shake-up comes as Congress debates whether or not to extend the bank’s authorization amid heavy opposition from conservative and libertarian groups led by Heritage Action for America.
Mr. Vandelay brings almost 30 years of experience in the export-import business, where he traded in commodities as varied as potato chips, diapers, and matches.

Yesterday, a friend wrote of his concerns about Eric Greitens, the Navy SEAL, humanitarian, Rhodes Scholar, charity founder, and former boxer who’s considering a run for Missouri Governor.
His concern began: “Most all GOP candidates proudly trumpet their positions . . . “
He was right, of course. Almost.

                We metDellena Jones during our first Ferguson BUYcott in August. Since then, St. Louis Tea Partier, Dottie Bailey, has made it her mission to help Dellena&amp;rsquo;s business survive and flourish.

Dellena&amp;rsquo;s business has fallen 60 percent since the first riots. She&amp;rsquo;s repaired the damage to her salon, but business is slow.
Despite all her challenges, Dellena still found the time and energy to host Center for Self-Governance training in her shop on a Saturday, foregoing that day&amp;rsquo;s revenue to learn about freedom and responsibility.

I did recently. This gem of a paragraph leapt off the page and into my mind:
 I believe this nation hungers for a spiritual revival; hungers to once again see honor placed above political expediency; to see government once again the protector of our liberties, not the distributor of gifts and privilege. Government should uphold and not undermine those institutions which are custodians of the very values upon which civilization is founded &amp;ndash; Faith, education and, above all, family.

                House mortgage-type instrument suggested as means to pay off national debt
Guest Post By Lee A. Presser
Interest rates have been held artificially low by the Federal Reserve since 2008. This has had the effect of hiding the true cost of increasing debt. As interest rates rise back toward 4%, the U.S. Treasury will have less money to spend on discretionary governmental functions.
The FY 2015 budget is approximately $3,900,000,000,000.00. Another way to look at that number is about $12,187.

                In its entire history, who was the safest CEO for Apple?
In other words, if you were a corporate recruiter hired by Apple&amp;rsquo;s board to find a chief executive, whom would hire?
I&amp;rsquo;ll answer this later, but first here&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m asking.
Who Would You Recruit? In response to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post on Brunner vs. Greitens, someone asked me a similar question about Eric Greitens. The inquisitor seems to question my judgment for preferring Greitens over John Brunner.

You support someone for office. Call this person Candidate A. You&amp;rsquo;re all in. You&amp;rsquo;ve told your friends about this great person.
Then another candidate jumps in to oppose your candidate. Let&amp;rsquo;s call this person Candidate B. This insurgent has great qualifications. You campaigned for Candidate B in another race a few years ago. You&amp;rsquo;ve talked him up. In the past, told your friends to vote for Candidate B.

Ben deferred to me to tell the Greitens story. I went through the usual, remarkable life of a man, eleven years my junior, a century my senior. I told him about Duke, boxing, Bosnia, Rwanda, Mother Teresa. I told him about boxing at Oxford and becoming a SEAL.
Nothing from Brett.

But I said kids really don&amp;rsquo;t need more technology in school. Technology, I said, was like sex education: they&amp;rsquo;ll get more than they can handle on the streets or watching TV.

I noticed no one rose to argue, so universal laziness is a given.
When political consultants and parties recruit candidates, they do the lazy thing. They look for candidates who are easily electable. They want people who look good, speak well, shake hands like they&amp;rsquo;re still alive, and never made the papers for slapping their spouse.
Actually, they want people who are squeaky clean. Boring.

I&amp;rsquo;d get angry when I was wrong, too. More accurately, I&amp;rsquo;d get angry when someone found out I was wrong.

                My story on the Justice Department&amp;rsquo;s Ferguson report addressed race early. .
So let&amp;rsquo;s have a little blunt talk about race from a West County white guy&amp;rsquo;s point of view (which is alway helpful).
Faction A and Faction B Whenever race comes up, two large factions shut down. They shut down intellectually because &amp;lsquo;race&amp;rsquo; touches an irrational, emotional nerve.
Faction A views every issue as a race problem. They see rain at a picnic as racist.

                The will of man is not shattered, but softened, bent, and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy, but it prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, but it compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.

                The human brain is three times as sensitive to pain as it is to gain.
That’s a gross over-simplification, but it’s basically true. In other words, you’ll work three-times harder to save a dollar you have than to earn one you don’t.
Put another way, you won’t bet a dollar with even odds unless you stand to gain three dollars for a win.
That’s not a flaw. It keeps you alive.

Just days before State Auditor and Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Schweich died, Eric Greitens announced an exploratory committee. Greitens wants to test the water of a possible run for Missouri Governor as a Republican.
Greitens would be, perhaps, the most remarkable human being ever to pursue the office of Governor of Missouri. Here’s a sampling of Greitens’s achievements:

Rock n Roll Lunch We met for lunch on a hot day in April 2010. I expected a typical GOP establishment hack: smooth, overly friendly, defensive, and forgettable. I expected the man others told me to expect. But I met someone very different.
How different? That lunch ended listening to his band&amp;rsquo;s recording of their original rock song.

This new empire will resemble the Soviet Union in shape, the Czars in style.
We looked at this subject over the summer (here and here). To summarize those blogs:
 The US-led coup of Ukraine convinced Putin to reassert safer borders Russia wants to build a buffer between itself and NATO Putin wants to re-establish a Russian Empire to revitalize Russian pride and influence Western debt and war-weariness make NATO impotent Putin knows the next US president might be more of a man than Obama, even if its Hillary Putin will want to complete his expansion by January 20, 2017 Ukraine is as good as done and Poland will fall under Russian influence  I still believe all of that.

                Why have conservatives and right-leaning libertarians made so little progress since 2009?
Consider that the GOP was written off for dead following the 2008 election. Republicans disappeared from the press. When a Republican popped up on a Sunday talk show, he was talking about compromise and getting along.
Then the Tea Party happened, and all of a sudden the GOP&amp;rsquo;s testes descended. But after two off-year wave elections that gave the GOP their largest majorities since Hoover, the GOP seems poised to double down on the crony capitalist, elitist policies and candidates that got them tossed out of Washington in 2006 and 2008.

Our annual St. Louis Tea Party / Heritage Action Christmas Party started at 6:00 in the evening on December 17. I knew Auditor Tom Schweich planned to attend, and I looked forward to seeing him.
About 3:00 the problems started. People scurrying to wrap up projects before the Christmas break led to errors, questions, and never-ending email threads.

Boehner is moving quickly to purge conservatives from all committees of meaning. He has vowed to cooperate with the White House and Democrats. He has vowed never to shut down government again, no matter how evil, onerous, or destructive of liberty government becomes.
Boehner has gone full native.

For the record, I&amp;rsquo;d love to see the election go to a second, third, fourth, or ninety-fifth ballot. But I don&amp;rsquo;t expect Boehner to lose. And if Boehner should lose, Gohmert might not win. The winner will need a LOT of Republican votes, and Boehner supporters won&amp;rsquo;t vote for the guy who inserted himself into the race.

 In my agency, those of us in patrol had to keep a &amp;ldquo;Daily.&amp;rdquo; This would be a formal document that showed the times, addresses where we went, written in code, of what we had done.

And, yes, &amp;ldquo;House Republican Leadership&amp;rdquo; is a code word for Ann Wagner.
Every victorious Republican ran on a promise to aggressively check Obama&amp;rsquo;s illegal executive actions.
They weren&amp;rsquo;t all lying. Only the &amp;ldquo;leaders&amp;rdquo; lied.
House leadership is trying to weasel out of its commitment to voters to block Obama&amp;rsquo;s illegal activities.
The House can easily** attach a rider to the upcoming spending bill** prohibiting any money from going toward Obama&amp;rsquo;s 10 illegal illegal alien memoranda.

                The danger of jumping to conclusions isn’t that you might be wrong. It’s that your brain will be unable to recognize its error.
We’ve all heard of the psychological (or just logical) fallacy of confirmation bias. It’s worth looking at three aspects of confirmation bias from Science Daily:
*1. In psychology and cognitive science, confirmation bias (or confirmatory bias) is a tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one&amp;rsquo;s preconceptions, leading to statistical errors.

Even the New York Times admitted the protests in Mike Brown&amp;rsquo;s name are actually the Revolutionary Communist Party advancing Marxism. (The NYT pulled down the story on Sunday morning. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have linked it, anyway.)

                The US House of Representatives is not a meritocracy. And that&amp;rsquo;s a shame.
House &amp;ldquo;leadership&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually have anything to do with leadership. It has everything to do with money.
In a story about the fall from power of Nancy Pelosi, Michael Barone describes how the House leadership process evolved from seniority to raw cash.
  For years, liberal Democrats had decried the seniority system, which automatically made conservative Southerners (and/or senile members) committee chairmen.

I understand how someone could feel that their &amp;ldquo;gratitude privilege&amp;rdquo; had been revoked. We lost our daughter just before Christmas in 1994, about four weeks after I got out of the Navy.

People tell me Republican consultant John Hancock is a really nice guy.
I think they&amp;rsquo;re right. And, as Hancock&amp;rsquo;s clients have learned repeatedly, nice guys finish last.
The clearest example of Hancock&amp;rsquo;s failure was John Brunner&amp;rsquo;s campaign for US Senate in 2012.
Brunner is an exceptional businessman with a remarkably clear and accurate political philosophy. Had Brunner succeeded in winning the GOP nomination for Senate, Claire McCaskill would be retired, the GOP would have a Senate majority already, and Rand Paul would have a philosophical friend in the upper chamber.

Republicans were supposed to lose governor seats. Instead, they picked up nine or ten. That&amp;rsquo;s huge, because governors become presidents.

                The White House and its corrupt Department of Justice has one chance to change the election&amp;rsquo;s outcome.According to Nate Silver&amp;rsquo;s FiveThirtyEight blog, the GOP has a 62.1 percent chance of a Senate majority. With nine days left until the election, and with President Obama&amp;rsquo;s approval and likability plunging, the Democrats face a huge loss.
Apathetic Democrats Many political observers blame Democrat voter apathy, particularly among African-Americans. The black vote that swelled in 2008 and 2012 with Obama on the ballot shows signs of deflating in 2014 as it did in 2010.

                From about 1978 until the Monica Lewinsky fiasco, the GOP was called &amp;ldquo;the party of ideas.&amp;rdquo; I miss the ideas.
William F. Buckley helped. Buckley liked big ideas and smart people. He liked politicians who gave legs to great ideas and governors with the guts to experiment. Governor Ronald Reagan appeared on Buckley&amp;rsquo;s Firing Line shortly after the Gipper became California&amp;rsquo;s governor. Reagan talked about many ideas he was trying or hoping to try.

                I am scaling back my blogging.
I spend about 1-2 hours on most posts. That&amp;rsquo;s writing, researching, photo editing, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s time consuming. It&amp;rsquo;s also worth the effort.
Blogging is an opportunity cost, too. Every hour I spend blogging is an hour I&amp;rsquo;m not doing anything else. The things I&amp;rsquo;m not doing include:
** admiring my wife ** talking to my kids ** catching up with friends ** advancing my career ** cleaning up my office ** changing my underwear ** cheering on the Blues (or Cardinals or Rams) ** working out ** washing my car ** fixing that door that doesn&amp;rsquo;t open right ** training my dogs to make a proper CC and club soda ** paying bills ** answering emails ** blowing the leaves out of the garage ** hunting copperheads and rattlesnakes (we have both out here) ** visiting my parents

                Maybe this logic sucks, but this is my logic. When I vote, I ignore my positions on issues. Instead, I use my vote to advance two objectives:
*1. I want my vote to improve policy towards liberty. *2. I want my vote to maximize my political power.
A simple test that I ask myself is this: If I vote for A, do I expect resulting policy to be more or less to my liking?

Missouri Republicans are FREAKING OUT that Speaker Apparent John Diehl could go down to defeat at the hands of conservative/libertarian grassroots activists. The freak-out is over a press conference in Queeny Park at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, September 30.

I heard of the Stop Diehl project last week. On Saturday, mostly Republican volunteers began a door-to-door campaign in Diehl&amp;rsquo;s district to block re-election.

Rick Stream is &amp;ldquo;a quiet leader.&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t see him as a politician,&amp;rdquo; she told me. We were talking about Rick Stream, the candidate for St. Louis County Executive.

 No, Ann Wagner didn&amp;rsquo;t actually say that. But her comments to a 2nd District Republican committee meeting on Tuesday gave at least one attendee the impression that Mrs. Wagner opposes the idea of conservatives holding Congress accountable.
Ann Wagner Attacks the Conservative Heritage Action Rep. Ann Wagner accused the conservative Heritage Action for America of &amp;ldquo;pitting Republican against Republican&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;never attacking Dems&amp;rdquo; at the Republican meeting.

A couple days ago, I wrote that I will not vote for Ann Wagner&amp;rsquo;s re-election in 2014. I arrived at that position after realizing that Mrs. Wagner and I share incompatible, mutually exclusive views on the proper relationship between government and people. She believes government should run markets. I believe government should make sure markets are fair.

 To get to the lame duck.
You can&amp;rsquo;t trust the GOP establishment.
In case you missed it, the House GOP leadership pushed a Continuing Resolution to fund government through December. Now, these same GOP leaders will tell you they expect Republicans to take over the Senate in January. So why would they give Harry Reid a chance to use the lame duck Congress in December to pass an Obama-friendly long term CR?

                Rep. Ann Wagner&amp;rsquo;s Heritage Action Score is a disappointing 59. It&amp;rsquo;s about to drop even lower.
Last week, the Republican from Missouri&amp;rsquo;s 2nd Congressional District came out strongly in support of cronyism by endorsing and vowing to fight for extending the Export-Import Bank.
From Wagner&amp;rsquo;s interview with National Public Radio:
 “There is some talk about a short-term reauthorization, perhaps six or seven months on Ex-Im,” she said. “I’d like it to be longer than that.

Something has to give, and it&amp;rsquo;s usually the thing that doesn&amp;rsquo;t generate revenue.

                Did you ever wonder why do-gooders and social planners never pay for their crimes?
Yesterday, I wrote about Jesse Jackson dressing down at the hands of activists in a McDonald&amp;rsquo;s parking lot in Ferguson. I pointed out that Martin Luther King and Dick Gregory were similarly dismissed by rioters in the 1960s. Some things never change.
One thing that has changed is the economic gap between whites and blacks. That&amp;rsquo;s gotten worse despite trillions in federal poverty programs that went mostly to &amp;ldquo;community organizing.

                ****UPDATE
Tim Jones let me know that I&amp;rsquo;m giving the legislature more power than it actually has.
Veto sessions are limited to overriding vetos. Thus the name. BUT the governor can call a Special Session to vote on a Ferguson Tax Holiday. That session can run concurrent with the Veto Session, saving taxpayer dollars.
SO &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; New Action: Ask Jay Nixon (via Twitter and Facebook) to call a Special Session concurrent with the Veto Session to create a Tax Holiday for Ferguson/Dellwood.

                You can&amp;rsquo;t change the world in your living room.
That&amp;rsquo;s why a small band of (mostly) white people from (mostly) West County drove to Ferguson (and Dellwood) to shop tonight.
We targeted the small businesses that were hit hard by violence&amp;ndash;violence committed (mostly) by out of town agitators, criminals, vandals, and hooligans.
We drove to Ferguson to make two statements with our actons: 1) Ferguson is OUR community, and 2) Ferguson is open for business.

                Since the Post won&amp;rsquo;t run my reply a recent op-ed about the Ex-Im Bank, I&amp;rsquo;ll publish it here:
Huge multi-national corporations like to preach from the &amp;ldquo;small business&amp;rdquo; bible when it comes to the Export-Import bank. Unfortunately, most of the Ex-Im propaganda about how &amp;ldquo;small business&amp;rdquo; benefits crumbles under scrutiny.
Professor Stanford Levin of Southern Illinois University recently wrote an Op-Ed supporting reauthorization of the Export Import Bank. As the professor states, the Export-Import Bank provides cheap loans to foreign companies and governments with which to buy products sold by mostly large, multi-national companies with headquarters in the United States.

On Wednesday, April 16, 2003, I was in Bel-Ridge, Missouri, Municipal Court to plead “not guilty.” The violation listed on the ticket did not match the reality of what actually happened on the road. In a file folder, I had documents and photographs to rebut the charge. The ticket stated that Court convened at 6:30 P.M. I arrived twenty minutes early.
Before 9:30 that evening, I had been tightly handcuffed twice, verbally abused by police, pushed into a depressing detention cell, and made an example of in front of seventy-five to one hundred people.

                What did you think when you first heard reports of violence in Ferguson? I mean, after the shooting death of Michael Brown?
Did you ever for a moment think, &amp;ldquo;this is about more than just Michael Brown?&amp;rdquo;
I hate to say that. It&amp;rsquo;s embarrassing to admit that I&amp;rsquo;m so jaded as to think &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s all&amp;rdquo; when a young man dies. Sorry. I&amp;rsquo;m just being honest.

In the meantime, keep shopping Ferguson/Dellwood if you get the chance. And make an appointment on your calendar to shop Ferguson/Dellwood on Labor Day Weekend. Have out-of-town guests? Take them on a tour and have a meal in one of the great restaurants in the area.

I&amp;rsquo;m not saying poor people do bad things. I&amp;rsquo;m saying that, at some point, eliminating jobs and hope will drive people to take things. And they will take things by force. And they will show no mercy to anyone who tries to get in their way.

                I haven&amp;rsquo;t written about Ferguson because I&amp;rsquo;ve known too little to add value. But ignorance hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped others from stirring up hate and discontent. For example, Missouri&amp;rsquo;s shakedown artist, Lacy Clay.
Lacy Clay, speaking from a private island in the Carribean, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Michael Brown was murdered. Clay knew or should have known the effect of his words: more violence. Either Clay meant to incite violence or he has a casual disregard for the effect of his irresponsible speech.

In the United States, criminal trials have two parts:
*1. Determination of guilt or innocence *2. Determination of penalty
Does that make sense?
What if we did it the other way around? What if, first, the prosecutor and defense attorney had to convince the judge or jury of the appropriate punishment for the crime in question. In this phase, the state would present the facts of the case.

 But there was more to it than me knowing people would be angry about Mississippi. First, many of the people told me what they wanted to ask Reince.

Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s true, I have had disagreements with Erick in the past. I try to assess the situation, not just the person. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to disagree with someone on one subject and to agree with them on another.
If anything, Erick showed consistency by rescinding Trump&amp;rsquo;s invitation to Red State. Erick didn&amp;rsquo;t want the event to descend into chaos led by my friends over the Barbour episode; he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want a descent into chaos led by Donald Trump.

I have many reasons for hating elections. One reason, though, seems pretty common: horrible, insulting radio ads.
Two ads really stick out:
 The negative ad that mentions the sponsoring candidate&amp;rsquo;s opponent(s) five times as often as it mentions the candidate you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to remember at the poll. The couple having a stilted, phony conversation about the sponsoring candidate using words and interruptions that no human being ever uttered or ever will.

            <div class="card-text">
                Now that Amendment 7 has gone down in flames, let&amp;rsquo;s look at highway funding in Missouri.
Amendment 7 would have authorized a 3/4 cent sales tax increase in Missouri. The money was intended for transportation in the broadest sense of the word. Parks with dirt paths qualify, since people can walk on the paths. Even if the bill tightened down the definition of transportation, municipalities and counties would have merely shifted funds to other projects and replaced that money with Amendment 7 taxes.

A few weeks ago, hunkered down at my laptop in my hotel room in Jacksonville, Florida. I was exhausted from seven hours of travel and a time change. But I had to take a moment to recognize Ed Martin&amp;rsquo;s commitment to all the best the Republican Party stands for.
Ed is determined to expose the GOP establishment&amp;rsquo;s willingness to do anything to destroy grassroots insurgents. Thad Cochran&amp;rsquo;s forces in Mississippi threw ethics, morality, and decency to the wind in their quest to stop a Tea Party candidate from unseating the 128-term Cochran.

                No time for deep analysis tonight, but there&amp;rsquo;s a small political earthquake in St. Louis County.
With over 90% of the precincts counted in the Missouri primary, incumbent Congresswoman Ann Wagner has only 500 more votes than her November challenger, Democrat Arthur Lieber.

I get that this is a primary and that the St. Louis County Executive race drew a lot of attention. But Wagner won her seat in 2012 by 20 points.

Seriously. The president&amp;rsquo;s family has no more authority than anyone else. The reason people show contempt for activist spouses of presidents is the same reason history hates Marie Antoinette.
I know, the all-Democrat Congress passed the school nutrition law in 2010, but Michelle Obama wrote it.
Michelle Obama has dictated that no tasty foods may enter any school property. That ban includes school bake sales and snack shops which has PTOs scrambling to replace lost income.

Tea Party Patriots picked St. Louis to host the Gateway to November rally under the Arch. Unlike our rag-tag events, this one would be professional all the way: live music with Sounding Fathers, speakers you heard of before the movement began in February 2009, and real security.
The guest speakers began rolling into town on Friday the tenth.

When I write about freedoms lost, I don&amp;rsquo;t itemize the freedoms. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel too bad, though, because almost no one does. Itemizing sucks.
First, it&amp;rsquo;s hard work. &amp;ldquo;Losing freedom,&amp;rdquo; takes about three seconds to type and less time to read. Listing freedoms,on the other hand, takes that much time just to highlight all the freedoms and click the un-ordered list button.

Forgive me, but that was sort of a tease. Here&amp;rsquo;s the meat: Reagan wrote a proposal for the Republican Governors&amp;rsquo; Conference of 1967 to allow states to keep about 2 percent of all federal taxes raised in the state.

                Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it suck when Jay Nixon and Francis Slay get on opposite sides of an issue?
Where do we go?
They&amp;rsquo;re on opposite sides of Amendment 7, the largest tax increase in Missouri history. And you need to choose a side before August 5, because the ball&amp;rsquo;s in the voters&amp;rsquo; court.
But there&amp;rsquo;s no need to fear; Hennessy is here. And I heard Francis the talking Mayor on KMOX this morning (or maybe it was yesterday) talking about how much he loves, Loves, LOVES the 3/4 cent sales tax increase theoretically for transportation.

                Want to fix Missouri&amp;rsquo;s roads and cut taxes at the same time? Well, two American conservative icons showed us the way almost 50 years ago.
The Establishment likes to attack grassroots conservatives by claiming Reagan would have opposed the Tea Party. They&amp;rsquo;re wrong, of course, and the Transportation Empowerment Act tells us why.
In 1967, shortly after Ronald Reagan became governor of California, William F. Buckley Jr. asked Governor Reagan if was even possible to be an effective governor.

                What political label do you give yourself?
Yesterday, I blogged about calling myself a Republican. I was a kid.
Then, from about 1996 on, I called myself a conservative.
Over the past year or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken on the label of libertarian. Now, a simple online test confirms that I&amp;rsquo;m a right-leaning conservative. [Take the test yourself]
That&amp;rsquo;s exciting, because I feel like I need a new label.
Labels Matter I know there was a movement a couple of years ago to abolish political and ideological labels.

The Universal Veto Game  Sometimes my job as a consultant involves helping people decide what to do when no ideas have a consensus. Sure, someone in a hierarchy can dictate terms, but dictated solutions don&amp;rsquo;t really work in business. Cooperation and collaboration are too important for success, and dictated terms are usually executed half-assed.
So we play this game.

I usually don&amp;rsquo;t say much in response. After the disaster of the ill-conceived Clinton impeachment fiasco,** impeachment seems like a superstition**. Like a unicorn. I think impeachment is a dangerous tool and should never be used for political purposes.

                Not all casualties of war die in the field. Or even during hostilities.
We&amp;rsquo;ve learned that some of our warriors died because they landed on a &amp;ldquo;secret waiting list.&amp;rdquo;
Bureaucrats love pleasing their bosses. They live for it. In the case of the Veterans Administration, bureaucrats fired the final shot in the wars of at least 40 American warriors.
Sadly, the American government proved a deadlier foe than Hitler, Tito, Saddam, or bin Laden to some of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines.

                I knew it was getting late. I was leaving work, walking to my car, when I got a text message. My nephew scored two tickets to Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.I texted my son, Patrick, to see if he was home. I planned to fly home, put on my Blues sweater, grab Patrick, and fly down to the Scot.
But Patrick didn&amp;rsquo;t need a ride or a ticket. He was already on his way to the game with a friend.

Every day when I get to work, I go through a thirty-minute routine. I write down the 3 things I want to accomplish that day. I write down my appointments. I write down a one-sentence prayer. I copy a quote to guide me. With the time remaining, I learn one new thing.
Today that one thing I learned was humbling. Shameful, actually.

Instead, blogger Brett Logiurato wrote a fair assessment of what&amp;rsquo;s happened to the GOP since February 27, 2009.

Yes, I expect the Blackhawks to end the Blues’ delusions of Market Street parades this afternoon. The Blues’ tenacity, hitting, and heart can’t overcome their lack of goal scoring and playoff goaltending.

That conversation happened last Sunday at an Easter party. The Blues were up 2-0 at the time, preparing for Game 3 in Chicago. My trepidation stemmed from the pattern emerging:

                In 1977, the National Socialist Party (Nazi) applied to march and rally in Skokie, Illinois. Few communities want Nazis marching down their streets, but Skokie held a stronger case against the Nazis than most towns in America. About one person in every six of Skokie&amp;rsquo;s large Jewish population was a Nazi prison camp survivor.
 The debate was clear-cut: American Nazis claimed the right of free speech while their Jewish &amp;ldquo;targets&amp;rdquo; claimed the right to live without intimidation.

Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s piece also exploded the myth of &amp;ldquo;pro-business&amp;rdquo; way too many conservatives believe. Conservatism isn&amp;rsquo;t pro-business, it&amp;rsquo;s pro-market. I&amp;rsquo;ll let Jonah explain:
 Just to clarify, the difference between being pro-business and pro-market is categorical. A politician who is a “friend of business” is exactly that, a guy who does favors for his friends.

Rockwood NEA President Suzanne Dotta worked hard to influence the recent school board election. The candidates Ms. Dotta pushed won.
The new board hired Ms. Dotta as Director of Professional Learning within 72 hours of the election.
I expect Ms. Dotta to teach Rockwood&amp;rsquo;s professionals how to game the system for personal gain at taxpayer expense.

                This morning, a White House aide told reporters that Obama’s sanctions are visibly “weakening” Putin and Russia.
Hours later, the White House recognizes that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could come any moment.
 Speaking from the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, Mike Rogers, the chair of the House of Representatives intelligence committee, said US intelligence officials were convinced “that Putin is not done in Ukraine”.
 Surprise. As I’ve written, Russian paranoia demands a larger sphere of influence and a large buffer of puppet governments, all the way to the German border with Poland.

By &amp;ldquo;they,&amp;rdquo; you mean politicians, of course. Maybe you feel they listen to lobbyists and big corporations and banksters, but they don&amp;rsquo;t listen to their constituents.
I have to agree with you. Politicians don&amp;rsquo;t listen to their constituents. They don&amp;rsquo;t even know who their constituents are.
They know demographics and statistics about their constituents, but that&amp;rsquo;s like saying you know how a banana tastes because you read a chemical assay report of its contents.

                Ask yourself this: why did the stock markets rally today after Obama announced sanctions against Russians? I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to that, but first some background.
I&amp;rsquo;ve often said that Putin plays chess while Obama fumbles with checkers. I picture our president, chin resting on fist, brows squeezed in childlike concentration, as he carefully chooses between jumping Putin&amp;rsquo;s piece to end the game or getting another of his pieces &amp;ldquo;kinged.&amp;rdquo;
Of course, Obama goes for the kingship.

                Do you live in Rockwood School District?
I do. My kids all went to Rockwood schools. My wife taught in a Rockwood school for three years.
The teachers in Rockwood tend to think a lot like the people who live here. They&amp;rsquo;re not a bunch of wacked-out lefties. Not most of them.
Still, that good education has come with HUGE price tag. Rockwood is one of the most expensive districts in Missouri.

                In the 1970s, a magazine ad for Benson &amp;amp; Hedges cigarettes portrayed a hockey fight. Two players slug it out. Sticks and gloves litter the ice.
The point of view is on-ice, in the midst of the scrum. The crowd is on its feet, banging the glass. You&amp;rsquo;re right there with linesmen trying to break it up.
The hockey gloves are Coopers. Every hockey player knows the name. In the photo, one of the gloves has been doctored.

I firmly believe that the purpose of a company is to make life better, and if it does that well, it will make a profit. If, on the other hand, a company makes life worse, the market should let that company die.

                I stand by my assessment that Chris Christie&amp;rsquo;s leadership and management played a role in the retaliatory shutdown of Fort Lee&amp;rsquo;s access lanes to the George Washington Bridge. Yesterday,I compared the GWB scandal to several Obama scandals. I pointed out that conservatives must apply the same standards to Christie as we did to Obama when the IRS scandal broke.
Today, let&amp;rsquo;s look at Christie&amp;rsquo;s response and contrast it to Obama&amp;rsquo;s.

                One argument put forth by conservatives&amp;ndash;and even some liberals&amp;ndash;regarding the IRS scandal was this:
Obama set a tone that encouraged IRS workers to harass conservative and Tea Party groups. He didn&amp;rsquo;t have to give a direct order. His tone and statements clearly condoned such criminal behavior toward his political enemies.
Kimberly Strassel at WSJ.com:
 Mr. Obama didn&amp;rsquo;t need to pick up the phone. All he needed to do was exactly what he did do, in full view, for three years: Publicly suggest that conservative political groups were engaged in nefarious deeds; publicly call out by name political opponents whom he&amp;rsquo;d like to see harassed; and publicly have his party pressure the IRS to take action.

                Last week&amp;rsquo;s Weednesday Post generated several comments that took my side but the facts wrong. Specifically, a couple of commenters claimed &amp;ldquo;marijuana is harmless.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s not true.
While cannabis may be have fewer harmful effects than alcohol and tobacco, someone who abstains from all three will be healthier mentally and physically than the same person smoking pot.
On the other hand, a lot proponents of prohibition throw around bad science, too.

                Ben Sasse wants to break the back of lobbying and crony capitalism by moving the seat of government from Washington to Nebraska. Sasse is a Republican candidate for US Senate from Nebraska.
Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to cripple lobbying? But Sasse&amp;rsquo;s plan won&amp;rsquo;t cripple lobbying. It will inconvenience lobbyists for a year while they resettle in the Midwest. Then it&amp;rsquo;s back to business as usual.
Before you throw up your hands and say &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s hopeless,&amp;rdquo; here&amp;rsquo;s an idea that might actually end lobbying as we know it.

                I blog about tea party stuff 90 percent of the time. I get decent readership with those blogs, and I appreciate my loyal followers. Very much.
But as long as I write about stuff only conservatives and activist libertarians care about, only conservatives and libertarians will read my blog. That means our ideas won&amp;rsquo;t escape the echo chamber we&amp;rsquo;ve been yelling in for years.
When I write about the conservative/libertarian perspective on issues of wider interest, though, I bring in people who never otherwise read our views.

Many others commented as well. I will work through your comments as the blizzard rolls through this weekend. But I wanted to pull my reply to Dennis and Lisa and to link directly to their most salient comments.

Remember Leon Spinks? He beat Muhammad Ali. Then he got arrested a bunch, gained a lot of weight, and lost to Ali a few months later. He was pretty much done. And Ali was like 50 when Spinks lost to him.
Spinks had the whole world served up on a plate. He tried to eat it all at once. He choked on it.

                The other one was 1975. At least in my lifetime.
1975 was weird for good reasons and bad. Saturday Night Live debuted with the Not Ready For Prime Time Players: Dan Akroyd, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtain, Gilda Radner, and Garrett Morris. President Gerald Ford tried to stop inflation with WIN buttons (seriously). New York City faced bankruptcy, but, after initially saying &amp;lsquo;drop dead,&amp;rsquo; Gerry Ford ended up bailing it out with $2.

                Have you ever wondered why moments end?
I wrote about the Irish Moment and the Jewish Moment and the Gay Moment on Saturday. Three Moments enjoyed by identifiable groups of Americans. Moments that ended when the groups joined the main plot of the American story, leaving the artistic sub-plot to the next in line.
Demographics offer only one kind of Moment, though. There are cultural moments and fashion moments and, of course, political moments.

First, I was finally old enough (12) to not be so shallow and needy and get pissed off if I didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly what I wanted. Santa Claus and my parents and sisters were really good to me, but until 1975 I could still get worked up if the Erector Set I got wasn&amp;rsquo;t the 118-piece set with real electric motor.

                The vices are, indeed, let loose, and they wander and do damage. But the virtues are let loose also; and the virtues wander more wildly, and the virtues do more terrible damage. The modern world is full of the old Christian virtues gone mad. The virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone. Thus some scientists care for truth; and their truth is pitiless.

Everett Johnson, a lawyer representing the ghosts, says he will begin negotiations with the town’s haunted house tour guides, spirit shops, and even owners of haunted properties.
“The living have been exploiting these tortured souls for decades,” Johnson told Hennessy’s View.

The recreation complex was pretty rustic then. About ten cabins, a recreation hall with ping-pong and a huge fireplace. The big parking lot near the Rec Hall was covered with pea-size brown and tan gravel held in place by an eight-inch railroad tie wall.

Scientists study all kinds of things. One thing they study is ants, because ants teach a lot about communities.
In a recent study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, ecologists Shigeto Dobata and Kazuki Tsuji studied the effects of &amp;ldquo;cheaters&amp;rdquo; in a colony of Pristomyrmex Punctatus ants.

                I wanted to be William F. Buckley Jr. All I lacked was his intellect, education, and unique experiences.
Well, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be him. I wanted to be the next one.
Every day, I wrote a 750-word piece. Poorly. I believed that practice would improve my writing.
It didn&amp;rsquo;t.
One day, I realized, as long as I tried to be the next William F. Buckley, I was destined for frustration and failure.

                I can be pretty hard on Republicans. Not hard enough for some. Too hard for others.
But I, at least, try to time my battles for ideological consistency. As a general rule, odd-numbered years are for cleaning up the GOP. Even-numbered years are for cleaning out Democrats.
This is an odd-numbered year. Right up to the votes on the continuing resolution,my primary targets were Republicans, especially Roy Blunt.
Once the House exercised its Constitutional power of the purse strings, sending a popular continuing resolution to the Senate, the battle lines shifted.

RINO stands for &amp;ldquo;Republican In Name Only.&amp;rdquo; Rhinos and Elephants are both pachyderms, so it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty clever name for people who join the Republican Party but prefer the Democrat platform.

Even though there&amp;rsquo;s no cost involved, the White House chose to dishonor the veterans&amp;rsquo; request. It send forth &amp;ldquo;goons,&amp;rdquo; in Senator Paul&amp;rsquo;s works, to erect barricades around the memorial.

As the continuing resolution fight approached, I expected House Republicans to cave. I expected Boehner to make a half-hearted attempt to use debt ceiling, instead of continuing resolution, as leverage to stop Obamacare. And I expected Republican Senators to make a stand.
But that&amp;rsquo;s not what happened.
In reverse order, Senate Republican leadership ran away from confrontation like schoolgirls spying a snake. Led by Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, and Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Junior Senator Roy Blunt, the GOP attacked Senators Mike Lee and Ted Cruz instead of Obamacare.

McConnell will, of course, vote nay on the final bill. But that&amp;rsquo;s just a gimmick.
McConnell&amp;rsquo;s slick maneuver is short-sighted. It will bite him.  Slick Mitch knows as well as anyone that Obamacare is a disaster for the American people.

From Heritage Action for America:
   This morning, House leaders announced they would pass a continuing resolution that funds the government but defunds Obamacare this week.
 In many ways, today’s announcement represents “a victory…for the GOP’s conservative wing and its tea-party allies.” (Wall Street Journal) However, it also represents a victory for the tens of thousands of workers who have seen their hours cut thanks to Obamacare and to the patients searching for new doctors.

So quit waiting for one, and quit staying at home and casting a protest vote.
We need your help. Who are we you ask? The voters who have been getting their asses handed to them. We have about a hundred years of making up to do and we need to get started with a strategy.

                _Historic Veto Session leaves Missourians frustrated. _
Why is it that we expect more from elected public servants than from ourselves? We demand and expect them to stand up, sometimes alone, in a chamber full of their peers and fight for us, yet we don&amp;rsquo;t do it in our own communities!
When we get frustrated with our elected representatives in Jefferson City (and Washington) who don&amp;rsquo;t stand up for us, our knee-jerk response is to try to elect someone else in their place and hope that new representative will listen to us.

Tonight’s speech was touted as the most important of his life. I doubt many will remember in 3 years.
“I have asked Congress to find something else to do for a couple of weeks,” seemed to be the theme. Or “there’s something wrong with you people for wanting to bomb a Middle East country. I mean, they’re Muslims for God’s sake.

                Eric Cantor’s latest tactic in the battle to defund Obamacare reminds me of the Trojan Rabbit in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
According to Business Insider’s Josh Barro:
 It&amp;rsquo;s a strategy predicated on the idea that Republican activists are stupid. Many of them are stupid. But they&amp;rsquo;re not stupid enough to fall for this.
 (Barro is hard-left, btw.)
From what I can gather, Cantor intends to pass two continuing resolutions out of the House.

Instead, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough told the Associated Press “a common sense test” implicates the Syrian government.
Well, no, it doesn’t. Quite the opposite, in fact.
Chemical weapons attacks are signs of desperation. But Assad’s forces have recently gained the upper hand against rebels according to numerous sources.

                I got four emails from Republican candidates today. They all sucked.
I’ve made every mistake they made, so I won’t beat anyone up over it.
But if conservative candidates want to win elections, they have to become—or hire—excellent marketers.
Everybody freaks out about the Democrat advantage in data, analytics, and social. But 80 percent of that gap is good execution of scientifically established marketing principles.
Republicans tend to despise marketing. They reject psychology.

  I am far from convinced that the chemical attack was perpetrated by the government. Terrorism expert Yosef Brodansky reported that the preponderance of evidence indicates Syrian rebels released the sarin attack.

Boehner doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to. He&amp;rsquo;s afraid that shutting down the government will hurt Republicans in the 2014 election.

 My hometown of St. Louis, Missouri was the largest city west of the Mississippi River in 1850, and the second largest port city in the entire country. Only New York handled more tonnage than the riverboats that docked, often more than a hundred at a time, at the St. Louis levee. Among other things, the riverboats supplied equipment, people, horses, and other materials to a burgeoning population of pioneers who rode wagon trains out from St.

                Get into the spirit of ‘76 with a great live musical You probably didn’t know that I was a theatre guy in high school and college. In fact, I was a theatre major for a couple of years. I think the right’s neglect of the arts is one of our biggest failings. The arts reach people at an emotional level. Intellectual arguments cannot change emotional attachments.
So here’s a chance to rev up your American patriotic spirits while connecting with the arts.

                The police in Watertown responded magnificently. But the most brilliant strategic move gets little notice from the press.

For about sixteen hours, hundreds of law officers, FBI agents, helicopters, and satellites scoured a relatively tiny area of Boston suburbs for one wounded terrorist. At the same time, they kept the public relatively safe, off the streets, and out of the way of their manhunt.
**But they didn’t find their man.

I just walked past a carbon-copy of my little doggy Stella guarding her homeless master who was sleeping on the stoop of a building at 8th and Mission. They were the first two people on the street who weren&amp;rsquo;t smoking dope.

Then it dawned on me. In San Francisco, there is no opportunity for people at the bottom to climb up to the top.

 Let’s stick with that one. To be terrorism, all of these five elements must be present. You can use it as a checklist:

                This post is a bit unusual for me.
Strange and disturbing thoughts crowded my mind tonight—Sunday, March 7.
These thoughts interrupted my television viewing. I couldn’t really focus. Then, I couldn’t sleep. The thoughts won’t rest, and they won’t give me rest. So I write.
I’m bewildered by the world’s stock markets. Someone told the Wall Street Journal that, sure, the US economy seems to be tanking, manufacturing’s falling, the labor rate’s in the toilet.

My Take
The Loudons took a big gamble. It’s about time someone did.
Gina is dead on. As I’ve been saying for awhile, we have to break out of our affinity bubbles. That means going to places we might not be accepted.

                The RNC’s Autopsy report wants to do away with caucuses and conventions, replacing them with regional primaries. But I’ll propose a different reform that will make candidate selection more interesting, whether in a caucus or a primary.
A Word About The Autopsy The idea of compacting the primary season and eliminating caucuses has some merit, but also a lot of downside. On the plus side are splashier events to showcase the party, fewer Tuesdays littered with politics, and, believe it or not, some economies as candidates can focus on one geographical region at a time.

What’s wrong with this headline?

I’ll tell you what’s wrong with it. It shouts: “Everybody’s getting an abortion!” Even if connected with messages that say abortion is wrong.
In numerous studies, messages intended to discourage a behavior by promoting the number of people engaged in the behavior (called negative social proof) actually caused the behavior to increase.

                The GOP’s self-examination on the 2012 election debacle rightly identifies marketing and messaging and lack of a ground game as contributors to that mess.

But the GOP’s self-exam missed a potentially fatal problem for the party: the American people simply do not trust Republicans on the budget.

No! It’s the worst possible outcome. Either of the two other outcomes—no implants or two—would be better than the compromise.

Those were the words of Missouri State Senator Kurt Schaefer to Director of Revenue Brian K. Long in a heated hearing at the Missouri State Capitol this morning.

Senator Schaefer and researchers at the Missouri Family Network, who broke this story, learned prior to the hearing that Long’s department has ordered Missouri fee office workers to violate state law by collecting and storing personal identifying information (PII) on everyone who renews a driver’s license, non-driver ID, or concealed carry permit in Missouri.

                A lot. Marijuana prohibition costs enough to put more than 900 new police officers on the streets.
Here’s the numbers from Harvard and Cato scholar Jeffrey A. Miron and marijuana law reform researcher Abhi Sivasailam (via Show-Me Cannabis):
 Missouri would save about $90 million in government expenditure and yield roughly $59 million in tax revenue annually. This assumes that marijuana would be taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco and that all other states and the federal government would also legalize.

 McCain lost his cool with Rand Paul and sounded like the old man down the street screaming to the new kids on the block, “Get off my lawn!”
 The real reason McCain and Lindsey Graham embarrassed themselves on the floor of Senate had nothing to do with what Rand Paul said. Rand Paul&amp;rsquo;s ideas terrify McCain, Graham, and most of the Republican establishment.

You slowly look around the desert and white shards of light catch your eye. Reflections of the sun off lenses of cameras mounted on poles about every every 30 degrees around the perimeter of the field.

2009: 59% Conservative

With almost 60% calling themselves somewhat or very conservative, how could Barack Obama get re-elected? How could Republicans fail to gain the Senate in 2010 and 2012? Come to think of it, how do Democrats win at all?
The answer is simple: being conservative doesn’t make you Republican, but being Democrat makes you a liberal.

                One of the most powerful tools of influence is fear.
Decades of research shows that fear of loss is about three times as motivating as hope for gain. (This changes under certain situations, like conditions of certain loss, but that’s for another time.)
So political message writers often use negative messages to influence voters to take a chance on a cause or a candidate.
This tactic works well with Republican voters, and less well with Democrats.

First, Rubio’s Cuban, and the GOP wants to court Latinos.
Second, Rubio’s relatively young, and the GOP wants to stop the bleeding when it comes to young voters.
But there’s a fundamental problem with the Republican approach, and it stems from the GOP’s least favorite discipline: behavioral science.

Republicans should announce “the sequester won’t be so bad” and shut up, and science tells us why.
Obama, the Dems, liberal pundits, the press, and even John Boehner are running around yelling about how horrible the sequester will be.
In some deep recesses of our minds, we agree. “Oh, my God! We’re all going to do die!”
Fear-mongering only works in the future because, in short, nothing is as bad (or as good) as we think it will be when we think about it.

Libertarian reforms offer the best hope, because all the other conservative factions – evangelicals, Second Amendment, home schoolers, fiscal &amp;ndash; have hit their high-water marks. We saw that in 2012. Liberty, however, sells with the kids. Or it might, if Republicans would try it.

                You probably never heard of Lance Beshore of Joplin, MO. He’s been Missouri’s delegate to the Republican National Committee’s Rules Committee for 12 years. He runs the lobbying department of Leggett &amp;amp; Platt furniture company. He’s on the Missouri Chamber of Commerce, and he’s chairman of the board of Freeman Health Systems.

In his roles at Freeman and the Missouri Chamber, Beshore advocates for Obamacare Medicaid Expansion in Missouri.

She sneaks out of bed at 4:45 every morning. No one else is up. No one’s watching her. At that hour, she can do whatever she wants without consequence.
She sneaks downstairs and puts on her make-up in front of the TV. She also encrypts mysterious lesson plans into a little black book. Names and numbers.

The Missouri Chambermaids of Cronyism Here’s the simple truth: the Missouri Chamber of Commerce is not conservative. It does not exist to advance limited government and fiscal responsibility and free enterprise capitalism. The Missouri Chamber of Commerce has become convinced that it must lie down before government and beg for scraps from the federal table.

Daniel Kahneman is a psychologist who won a Nobel in economics for Prospect Theory, more commonly called Behavioral Economics. In his book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman describes a cognitive bias that leads people to make the wrong choice on automobiles. But the bias might actually keep gasoline consumption high by fooling people with number.
Say you’re concerned with the amount of gasoline you use.

The Republican Primary season was already well underway. Before a single caucus or vote, though, we pretty much knew that Mitt Romney would win the nomination. He had the entire Republican establishment behind him, including true conservatives who wanted a “safe” candidate.
We know how that worked out.

What might have been had a strong conservative emerged in 2011? What if someone without baggage had prepared years in advance for a run against the weakened, staggering Obama?

The Nazis interned Frankl. He spent time in four concentration camps, including Auschwitz and Dachau. For three years, his captors made him dig ditches for railroads and water pipes, and fed him a slice of bread and an ounce or two of soup a day.

 Q: Which kills more people: guns or diabetes?
 Here’s what your brain is doing. It’s searching your memory for mentions of the keywords: “guns,” “diabetes,” and “kill.”
For most of us, one of the variables—guns or diabetes—carries a significantly heavier emotional weighting than the other. A paid-up-for-life member of the NRA might attach powerful positive emotions to “guns.” The parent of a child who died of complications of diabetes will attach high negative emotions to “diabetes.

                In an open Republican primary in Missouri’s 8th Congressional District, a solid conservative would beat an establishment &amp;ldquo;my turn&amp;rdquo; Republican, hands down. And the Missouri GOP would hate it.
That’s why I smell a rat. Would you be surprised to learn that Jo Ann Emerson and Lloyd Smith had this switcheroo planned months ago? You have to admit that the timing is suspicious:
 * Emerson wins a certain re-election * Smith announces he&#39;s stepping down as Missouri GOP Executive Director * Emerson announces she&#39;s resigning to become Queen of Lobbyists * Missouri&#39;s GOP Establishment breaks hips to tell reporters &amp;quot;Lloyd Smith&#39;s our man!

The GOP has no leverage in budget negotiations, and conservative denial won’t change that.
Use Game Theory As I wrote on November 12, fighting Obama – voting down a budget in the House – results in the GOP’s worst possible outcome: total blame for anything that goes wrong and no credit for anything that goes right.

In 1995, 56 percent of American described themselves as “pro-choice.” At the time, Michael Kinsley on CNN’s Crossfire declared the debate over.
Then something strange happened. Americans started changing their minds. The pro-life movement whittled away at public opinion.
By May of this year, Gallup found “pro-choice” to be at an all-time low:
 The 41% of Americans who now identify themselves as &amp;ldquo;pro-choice&amp;rdquo; is down from 47% last July and is one percentage point below the previous record low in Gallup trends, recorded in May 2009.

Yes, vote fraud is real. Voter rolls in most states need to be cleaned up. Voter intimidation should be harshly prosecuted.
You can sign up at True the Vote or Missouri Precinct Project to take effective, useful action. These organizations do vital work, and they both need more volunteers.
Using vote fraud, however, as an excuse for secession or for blocking the Electoral College vote is neither effective nor useful.

Unions destroy themselves like pathetic drunks, dragging down everyone around them.

In a fine example of anti-strategic thinking and un-game theory, the Bakers Union put 637 of its members out of work yesterday.
Hostess—makers of Twinkies—is bankrupt. Part of the bankruptcy involved rewriting union contracts to allow the company to stay in business.
Instead of taking one for the team and helping their company crawl out of its fiscal hole, the Bakers went on strike.

The same is true in political combat. For years the GOP upset Democrats at all levels through superior ground games. Typically, this process involves:
 * Identifying potential voters * Contacting the high-value targets * Registering the unregistered * Mobilizing them on election day  Karl Rove’s Crossroads PACs tried a different strategy this time.

                Conservatives take great pride in working, and for good reason. Work gives shape to life. Work is the poles of a tent, the bones of a body, the beams in the ceiling.

But work isn’t why we live. We live to pursue happiness.
For some, the pursuit of happiness involves acquiring property. Land, clothes, cars, plastic surgery. All examples of the pursuit of happiness.
Voting is another pursuit. People vote for minor candidates representing strange parties who have no chance of winning.

The final Gallup poll that year had a dead heat. Time Magazine’s November 3, 1980, called the race a dead heat. So did Newsweek.
The press was hoping John B. Anderson, a former Republican Congressman running for president as an independent, would siphon votes from Reagan. He did siphon votes from Reagan, but not nearly enough.

One reason the Middle Class has shriveled and wages shrunk over the the past four years is underemployment. People want full time work, but settle for anything. And anything is usually part time.
Most of the fantastic new jobs created since the 2009 have been part-time jobs.

                I Endorse Ed Martin Dear Friends,
This is an email to encourage you to remember to do all you can to get Ed Martin elected Attorney General of Missouri. I know there are a lot of races and it is easy sometimes to overlook some of the down-ticket offices. But the Attorney General is an extremely important office. He is the chief law enforcement official of the state. He is responsible for seeing to it that our laws are faithfully enforced and our constitutional rights protected.

                Gallup released its early voting poll today, and it shows Mitt Romney winning 52% to 45%—right in line with their Likely Voter poll numbers. Here’s the chart.

Politico Reporter Can’t Read But Gallup’s section on early voting by party ID completely lost Politico’s Kevin Robillard.
Robillard looked at the chart that shows when voters intend to vote by party and candidate and mistook it for voting results. This poll question shows that those who support Obama as as likely to vote early as are those who support Romney.

When America came under attack, Obama panicked and froze.
When Americans under his direction pleaded for their lives, he was afraid to pull the trigger.
Here’s the emerging picture.

Maybe they’ve read about socialism, seen the movies, and heard about it from their college professors—ya know, like the one who actually visited the old Soviet Union.
But those sources give only an intellectual view of socialism. You can’t actually _feel _it. And life, in the end, is about feelings.

                Polls do influence elections. That’s why people like Nate Silver and some of the writers at Business Insider are doing somersaults over Gallup’s Daily Presidential Tracking numbers.

For over a week, Gallup has shown a tidal wave for support for Mitt Romney. Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight tried to discredit Gallup by blogging about outlier results it’s shown in past years. Here’s the conclusion Business Insider reached:
 Bottom line: Gallup swings wildly and it frequently has results not in line with other pollsters.

The smartest man in the world can’t make a gaffe, surely. When Barack Obama says something ridiculous, mean-spirited, wrongheaded, or just plain dumb, he means it.
So we know Obama considers the murders of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others mere “bumps in the road” to his re-election. Four bumps, to be precise.
When Obama says Israel is just “one of our strongest allies” in the Middle East, no longer our strongest, he means it.

                A couple years ago, a lot of folks believed that victory in 2010 would be a cakewalk. Led by Tea Party activists, the GOP picked up over 800 legislative seats, state and federal, in the 2010 off-year election. Rumors of the Republican Party&amp;rsquo;s death had been greatly exaggerated.

Or so it seemed.
Novels and action movies involve a hero&amp;rsquo;s quest. The main character hopes to accomplish something. Dorothy wants to return to Kansas.

                A genius is someone who can hold contrary concepts simultaneously in mind.
What, then, do we call a person who simultaneously argues two contrary concepts?

How ‘bout “demagogue?”
A few weeks ago, Barack Obama told America’s business owners that they are not responsible for their success. “Someone else built that.”
Today, the same Obama told Mitt Romney that there not many people who consider themselves victims.
Does Mr. Obama believe that people in dire straights are not victims of circumstances?

Burroughs’s anti-Christian blasphemy in Naked Lunch. (Funny. I don’t recall reading about Christians blowing up embassies over that book’s publication.)

I&amp;rsquo;m pretty good at ignoring bogus, fraudulent polls like the one CNN released tonight. In that poll, CNN announced a massive 52-46 national lead for Obama. If true, the race would be all but over.
CNN, of course, cooked the books on this one.
About one-third of voters describe themselves as independents, CNN sampled only 3% independents for its latest poll.

On Tuesday, the Democratic National Convention stripped God&amp;rsquo;s name from their platform and rejected Israel&amp;rsquo;s choice of Jerusalem as its capital.
Wednesday, the party panicked and rushed in an amendment to restore God and Jerusalem.

Well, the Democrats passed a new platform today. Two headlines emerged:

  The Democrats rejected Jerusalem as Israel&amp;rsquo;s capital.
  The question is: can you trust them? Do Democrats really reject God and reject Jerusalem as the center of Israeli political life?

&amp;ldquo;I could kill him,&amp;rdquo; is an idiom. Its cousins include &amp;ldquo;wring his neck&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;poke his eyes out.&amp;rdquo; Idioms hyperbolize our emotional reaction to an event.
I was angry because Todd Akin gave the left a great talking point in the infamous interview. I like Todd Akin. I voted for him.

Here’s seven more warning signs that Obama’s 6-year campaign is about to implode:

                The story Isaac is about tests of faith.
God commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, his only son, born after Abraham and Sarah had given up hope of conceiving.
Once Isaac was bound and placed on the altar, God stayed Abraham&amp;rsquo;s hand. &amp;ldquo;Now I know you fear God.&amp;rdquo;
You know the rest.
It just struck me this morning, listening to the weather during Jamie Allman&amp;rsquo;s show, that Isaac now threatens the GOP convention, dangling above Tampa like Abraham&amp;rsquo;s dagger.

Before we get too far down the Akin rally road, let&amp;rsquo;s get some solid advice to Mr. Akin.
His principles, his spine, his grassroots do no good if Missouri turns blue. He cannot advance his causes from his house in Wildwood. Failure to take the Senate makes Obamacare permanent, at least in our lives.

I think it&amp;rsquo;s smart to have a plan in case Todd Akin drops. The GOP central committee is working on a plan. If you wait until after a vacancy occurs, your preferences will be meaningless.
That said, if you should decide to plot a contingency to influence the selection of a candidate to fill a vacancy that might occur, consider this: **the MOGOP central committee is not tea-party-ish.

Sometimes, the ideal is paramount. In 2012, we simply must take the US Senate. We must put Claire McCaskill out of office. And we must send a strong conservative to the US House of Representatives from Missouri’s 2nd Congressional district.
Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District has been well served by Todd Akin.

                If Mitt Romney applied game theory in choosing Paul Ryan, I have renewed respect for him. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why, but first a bit of background on game theory.
Game theory is a branch of social science concerned with strategic decision-making. It is most closely associated with economics. Professor John Nash, the subject of the movie A Beautiful Mind, won a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in game theory. (For a great primer on the subject, read Thinking Strategically: the competitive advantage in business, politics, and everyday life.

                America is suffocating under an amazing tax burden, but most Americans STILL underestimate how much their tax bill really is. That’s because Washington has done a fantastic job of forcing employers to hide most of the taxes you pay. If people had to see and deal with their total liability, the Democratic Party would be swept into the dust bin of history.

                Choosing Paul Ryan as his running mate was a great Romney move. Looking ahead, Romney sees movement conservatives working hard right up to the election—even if he or his advisors continues to say stupid things. That was necessary.
SCROLL DOWN FOR TWO IMPORTANT EVENTS THIS WEEK
But it wasn’t enough to win the election and unseat America’s first anti-American president. To do that, we must find a way to win over the selfish middle.

                Why did murder skyrocket in Chicago as soon as Rahm Emanuel became mayor? Why have Americans become nastier and meaner since Barack Obama became president?

As Michael Dukakis told us, a fish rots from the head down. Obama surrounds himself with people who thrive on decay and death.
After four years, Obama has nothing to say for himself. Nothing. He can only cut and attack and lie and sneer and mock like a high school bully.

Generational historians William Strauss and Neil Howe describe a generation of &amp;ldquo;nomads&amp;rdquo; in their prophetic book The Fourth Turning.

They came of age curtailing the earlier rise in youth crime and fall in test scores—yet heard themselves denounced as so wild and stupid as to put The Nation at Risk.

                The horror in Aurora, Colorado, gave President Obama a little cover last Friday. That&amp;rsquo;s because the Labor Department announced that unemployment rose in 27 states.
President Obama promised to hold unemployment under eight percent if Congress passed the stimulus package in 2009. Congress did, but Obama failed. Remember all those green jobs? They&amp;rsquo;re gone.
**The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t Barack Obama; the problem is liberalism. **

Race to the Top was a contest in which states agreed to let the federal Department of Education, via two puppet organizations, run all of the state&amp;rsquo;s education systems. In exchange, some states were awarded money, but others were not.

                Tax credits reward particular businesses or developers with tax dollars from the general population. They concentrate wealth in a few hands. Tax credits are the way politicians play the market with someone else&amp;rsquo;s money.

Worse, **Republicans are addicted to tax credits. **
A Missouri House Republican leader told a constituent that his party gives tax dollars to people who &amp;ldquo;spend it smarter.&amp;rdquo; Bill Clinton said the same thing in about 1992.

                Missouri&amp;rsquo;s primary is August 7. Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Republicans now litter the airwaves and in-boxes with smears against their Republican opponents. What strikes me is the weakness of so many of their pitches.
Every political ad is a pitch. It&amp;rsquo;s a chance to sell an idea and to volunteer as that idea&amp;rsquo;s champion in some high office. What a noble calling.
Few politicians take that noble path, sadly. Instead, they bully and vilify their opponents&amp;ndash;especially their primary opponents.

If you read my blog, you’re likely one of the “those people,” the ignorant masses who don’t understand the fineries of the legislative process. You don’t appreciate how hard the insurance industry lobbyists worked with Jefferson City to craft a law that sold only a bit of you into slavery while ensuring the insurance companies remained profitable and your favorite Republican legislators had the money to campaign next year.

In his new best-selling book, Jonah Lehrer discusses the link between depression and creativity:
 This helps explain why Forgas has found that states of sadness— he induces the downcast mood with a film about death and cancer— also correlate with better writing samples; subjects compose sentences that are clearer and more compelling.

                In the Ronald Reagan movie Kings Row, Reagan plays Drake McHugh, whose legs are sawn off by a sadistic, class-conscious doctor.

Everyone remembers the line “Where’s the rest of me?” No remembers what happens after that. I’ll fill you in.
McHugh’s best friend, a psychiatrist, decides to tell McHugh (Reagan) the truth: his legs were perfectly healthy, but the doctor cut them off to keep the lower class McHugh from pursuing the doctor’s debutante daughter.

                I love some things about Business Insider. Mostly its great headlines.
Unfortunately, sometimes its writers show an ignorance of basic economics in their rush to catapult Obama to a second term. Joe Weisenthal is just the latest example.
Joe tries to claim that economic recovery in the US is retarded by loss of public sector jobs.

What Joe doesn’t seem to get is this: the private sector pays for those public sector jobs.

                In a column intended to attract readers, not to promote hard economics, Rotman University economist Richard Florida declares that home ownership is terrible for the US Economy.

The problem is, like many economists,** Florida’s understanding of home ownership is 180 degrees ass-backwards**. Florida thinks that home ownership is supposed to _cause_ economic growth.
 Instead of leading to economic development, higher rates of homeownership today are associated with lower levels of it.

And when Obama won, many believed the tales of the Obama Youth.

She also hinted that her preference for bison meat to beef indicates her heritage.
“My pepaw taught me this dance when I was a little girl,” Warren said during a short session with reporters at a high school gymnasium in Cambridge, MA.

                The look on George “Stephie” Stephanopoulos’s face was priceless. He had to say it.

“ABC News now projects that President Obama will go down to defeat.”
He couldn’t bring himself to say, “Romney won” or “Republicans won.” He just couldn’t.
The network analysis was a political cliché run amok. My favorite came from James Carville who told CNN viewers that the election result “proves that crackers and racists vote.”

I received this response from Freida Keough, St. Louis County Director ofMissouri Precinct Project:
 My answer: We have 56 positions for committeemen and women in 28 Townships for St.Louis County. Did you know that 35 new individuals filed for these positions in addition to the incumbents. Coincidence? I don&amp;rsquo;t think this happened because people felt they have nothing else to do.

                Let me get this straight. Secret Service Agents and some military guys brought more than 20 &amp;ndash; count &amp;lsquo;em, _twenty _&amp;ndash; hookers to a hotel in Cartagena, Columbia. The Americans were drinking&amp;ndash;a lot, according to hotel staff. When the girls were ready to leave, apparently, the Americans refused to pay.
I guess these soldier or sailors or Marines don&amp;rsquo;t watch enough movies. They&amp;rsquo;d know how hookers act when they don&amp;rsquo;t get paid.

First, Eric Reeve The Lake Liberal wrote this letter-to in Lake News Online. He concludes:
 We may hear of the Tea Party here and there in the future, but I doubt it will ever figure prominently in American politics again. I say we should take a moment and reflect on what it might have been as we say farewell to the once promising Tea Party movement.

 The structure and left-wing dominance of the nominating commission (the distinctive feature of the Missouri Plan) has led many to argue that the state should amend the constitution to either directly elect judges or have them selected under something mirroring the advice/consent model set forth in the U.

The two allegedly made contributions to the Democrat Party (legal), and reimbursed themselves out of Missouri Employers Mutual Insurance Company’s coffers (illegal).
But that’s not the weird part. After all, election fraud is the Democrats’ principal form of amusement.
The weird part is the statement from Griesedieck’s law firm.

 Is Obamacare a tax? (8-1 Against)  Technically speaking, if Obamacare is a tax, it could be non-justiciable until implementation. However, judicial precedence suggests the courts may review a tax before its implementation in certain circumstances. The Government did not even want to argue that Obamacare was a tax, so the Supreme Court (SCOTUS) appointed a separate attorney to make the argument. The only SCOTUS justice that appeared to entertain this line was Justice Breyer.

Still, it’s sort of weird that after three years of public, wildly emotional and stupifyingly complex arguments, the fate of the republic comes down to a short meeting in Washington involving nine people in a paneled room.

 If the court upholds ObamaCare, it will end the principle of government limited by a written Constitution. Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia said as much. A vote by Kennedy to uphold the legislation, then, would be a vote for unlimited government power.

                When the Supreme Court rules on ObamaCare, it will define Barack Obama as either a winner or loser.

James Carville says overturning ObamaCare would be the best thing that could happen to Democrats. I think he’s wrong.
ObamaCare is the centerpiece of Obama’s term in office. He put all of America’s business on hold for a year to pass it. He coerced, lied, intimidated, and threatened to get the law passed.

                Everyone (including me) is cracking on Donald Verrilli, Obama’s Solicitor General. He figuratively died on the biggest legal stage in the world today. Here’s a sample of the left’s reaction to Verrilli’s performance:
Mother Jones:
 Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. should be grateful to the Supreme Court for refusing to allow cameras in the courtroom, because his defense of Obamacare on Tuesday may go down as one of the most spectacular flameouts in the history of the court.

First,Ginsburg statement:
 Mr. Verrilli, I thought that your main point is that, unlike food or any other market, when you made the choice not to buy insurance, even though you have every intent in the world to self-insure, to save for it, when disaster strikes, you may not have the money.

The St. Louis Cardinals owe big government statism and technological innovation a big thanks, in addition to geography and great teams. The technology was radio. The big government statist?

Jason Plummer, a 29-year-old lumber heir, is the GOP Establishment’s appointed candidate for US Congress in Illinois’ 12th Congressional District. He’s facing a shockingly tough race from former police detective and former Belleville Mayor, Rodger Cook. (Never underestimate a detective’s tenacity.)
In a debate last week, Plummer failed his one simple assignment. Despite a nearly unlimited war chest from his family’s fortune and the Illinois GOP treasury, Plummer said something stupid.

Governments don&amp;rsquo;t keep up with technology or culture. Nor can they act nimbly. A start-up produces finished products worth millions in four months; it takes government that long to start the first feasibility study.

Sandra Fluke, the student, begged Congress to confiscate property from me and millions of other taxpayers in order to satisfy her sexual appetite.
Rush Limbaugh pointed out that law school lasts three years, condoms cost about a buck each, and Ms. Fluke needed 3,000 of them just to make it to the bar exam.

                Yesterday, I blogged about freedom envy—the feeling Americans get when they look at countries where the people get freer every day.
Today, thanks to Economic Freedom blog, we have a great video to introduce the idea of economic freedom.
Does that sound silly? I mean, aren’t Americans born with an understanding of economic freedom? And craving to preserve it?
Yes, we are.
But our schools, entertainment, press, and, above all, GOVERNMENT beats economic freedom out of us by the time we’re 14 years old.

                The first entry in National Review’s “The Week” from sometime around 1990 listed ten or so former Soviet bloc countries that recently had shed the yoke of communist repression. And it made a simple statement:
 “It must be nice to live in a country where you get freer every day.”

                The 3rd Anniversary Tea Party rocked . . . because of the great patriot-activists who have decided it’s time to act and win.

Although Dr. Larry Schweikart couldn’t make it (because of the Chicago snow storm), Friday’s event was better than planned or expected. Tea Party champion Michael Patrick Leahy jumped into fill a last-minute void, and the crowd loved it.
I had the the pleasure of reading and advanced copy of Mike Leahy&amp;rsquo;s new book, Covenant of Liberty: The Ideological Origins of the Tea Party Movementin December.

                Yes, I’ve written about little else. The 3rd Anniversary Tea Party is something of an obsession with me. And for good reasons: * Obama is surging * Apathy has seized the right * America’s future hangs in the balance
But there’s a much bigger reason you—you, the person reading this blog—should attend the 3rd Anniversary Tea Party.
That reason is personal, powerful, and acute.
That reason is this:You cannot live with yourself if Obama wins and you failed to do everything in your power to stop him.

Lent prepares us for the cycle of mortality and resurrection, perfected by Christ, without which life has no meaning. It’s a time of humility. We call to mind our human brokenness in hopes of making ourselves better imitators of Christ.
On Ash Wednesday, we mark ourselves with the sign of the cross in ashes. **“Remember, man, that you are dust and unto dust you shall return (Genesis 3:19).

But the Romans had nothing on we moderns when it comes to persecuting Christians. Today, Christians are the most persecuted religious group on the planet. And the problem grows worse every day.

By “relate to,” the media and Romney’s handlers actually mean “hoodwink.” While Romney might secure the GOP nomination without conservative support, his campaign will go down in flames without conservative grassroots boots on the ground from Labor Day to Election Day.

                When the rules become so complicated and convoluted that well-meaning people unwittingly break the law, the legal system has lost its moral authority.
Students at Georgetown University are discovering the horrors of, what Tocqueville called “small complicated rules, minute and uniform, through which the most original minds and the most energetic characters cannot penetrate, to rise above the crowd.”
An editorial in The Hoya, the official student newspaper, students advocate “eliminating bureaucracy.

                “Anybody will beat Obama.”
I get some comments and see a lot of tweets about the inevitability that any Republican will win in November.
That’s frightening.
The prospect of a Republican beating Obama isn&amp;rsquo;t frightening, of course—any of the four remaining candidates would be night and day better for our future. What’s frightening is that so many people bet on the unknowable.
Except in rare cases—one candidate is caught stealing from a church weeks before the election—political elections carry too many variables for anyone to predict their results a month in advance, much less three-quarters of a year ahead.

                Ask a real partisan—someone with a Ron Paul or Ed Martin sticker on his car&amp;ndash;why he supports that candidate. You’ll get a lot of rational reasons.
Then challenge just one of those reasons, and what do you get? More reason?
No, you get raw emotions.

That’s because the emotional mind—the part of the brain designed for survival—exerts far more influence over our thinking that most people are willing to admit.

                At some point, each additional GOP Presidential debate becomes just a bigger pain in the . . . But science shows us that the last debate before a vote—and the last memorable event in the last debate—is paramount to how we remember the entire event.
In fact, memorable moments at the end, not consistent performance throughout, determine who wins and who loses.
In this awesome TED talk, Nobel winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains the weird difference between our experiencing selves and our remembering selves.

                Two weeks ago, weeks ago, how many Missouri statewide offices did you expect to flip? Be honest.
Yes, there are great people running for Governor, Secretary of State, and Treasurer. And we already have a fine Lieutenant Governor Kinder running for re-election.
But numerous factors, like name recognition, experience, and Jay Nixon’s weird relationship with Republican House leadership, made a major upset unlikely. And no Republicans had stepped up to challenge Chris Koster for Attorney General.

                Truth is, not all companies, not all business ideas, can make it on their own.
It’s easy to say that a good idea will automatically lead to a successful business. But it’s a lie.
Apple did not become Apple without investors. Sure, there are some examples of businesses that flourished without financial help. But not many. We’ll never know the wonderful ideas that died in their owner’s garage for lack of financing.

                Most Americans know more about forensic evidence in the Casey Anthony case than they do about the Constitution. That ignorance gave Barack Obama the hubris to end constitutional government in the United States. He did it, and you probably didn’t even notice.
Over the course of a week, Barack Obama made a series of so-called recess appointments. In the process, he and his henchmen in Eric Holder’s Justice Department effectively nullified the US Constitution.

And Ron Paul did way better than I expected. Congratulations to Dr. Paul and Mitt. 
I still think my Saturday night post accurately reflected the national impressions, though. That’s backed up by this CBS News poll that shows Republicans believe Santorum most closely shares their values, but—and this is a J Lo but—they believe Romney is more electable.

                It depends on how you score. 
I see three scoring scenarios: 1. Best conservative performance 2. Best electability performance 3. Best positional performance
Conservative performance is pretty clear: whose answers appeal to conservatives? (Does not mean conservatives believed the candidate meant what he said.) This is not Tea Party scoring, either. I’m not limiting my evaluation to the 3 core Tea Party principles of Constitutionally limited government, free markets, and fiscal responsibility.

Conservatives and libertarians dominate the caucuses.
Romney is the choice of the Republican establishment. The cronies poured millions into his campaign even before he declared himself a conservative. He’s won endorsements from just about every big name general election loser include Bob Dole and George H.

Jobs’s life left insanely good lessons. Some lessons instruct us on how to do things. Others warn us of bad things to avoid.
One of the good things Steve Jobs taught us: focus. Maniacal focus on things that mattered, and a pathological aversion to distractions.
One example. When Jobs returned to Apple after 10-year exile, he took stock of all the projects underway.

                Some St. Louis area conservatives cheered Roy Blunt’s (R-MO) elevation to the Number 5 leadership position in the Senate Republican caucus.

I didn’t. At least not politically. I like Senator Blunt personally, so I’m happy in that respect. But I’m not happy for the reasons some others are.
First, as I told Jo Mannies of the St. Louis Beacon, internal party stuff isn’t really a Tea Party matter. Leadership in the Senate’s GOP caucus is for Republican Senators to worry about.

                Everyone knows and accepts that government does stupid things. Sometimes it feels like people institute governments and delegate them certain powers just to give us something to complain about.
Government stupidity, scandal, and corruption hits different people in different ways. Government hyperactivity keeps poor people poor by limiting opportunity and by building barriers to exiting poverty programs. “If you take that job, you’ll lose your health insurance.” Compassion my non-qualifying asset.

Because so many school systems have driven great English literature out of students’ hands and minds, it’s possible that some kids never read Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol. If you’ve never read this classic, please do so now. You need it.

Back? Good. Fascinating stuff, isn’t it? And so much more accessible than David Copperfield, which was my introduction to Dickens.

 &amp;ldquo;At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,&amp;rdquo; said the gentleman, taking up a pen, &amp;ldquo;it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time.

&amp;ldquo;EH?&amp;rdquo; returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s to-day, my fine fellow?&amp;rdquo; said Scrooge.

 THE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.
It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand.

Maybe that’s why I’m a lower-case “r” republican and not an upper-case one.
Republicans seem to feel every hill is worth dying on.
What else could explain the House’s rejection of a silly payroll tax cut extension followed by a doubly-damaging capitulation?
By “silly,” I mean ill-advised, inconsequential, irrational, and fiscally irresponsible. The Senate’s two-month extension of the Social Security tax cut represents the worst of Washington.

                Have you ever studied human networks?
I’m not talking about online social networks alone, but any kind of human network.
They’re amazing.

Networks tend to determine who we date, who we marry, and where we work. Our lives are more influenced by networks than we can imagine.
 A network community can be defined as a group of people who are much more connected to one another than they are to other groups of connected people found in other parts of the network.

 Johnny,
 Sorry that I&amp;rsquo;m just getting to this. I get a lot of email, and sometimes I miss things.
I organized the tea party in St. Louis in 2009. I did so because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that governments accumulate power until they crush liberty and freedom.

I have. And I’ve made feeble attempts to satisfy that urge. Feeble.
Still, when I’ve done something “good” for others with no expectation of return, I kind of thump my chest and smile at myself in the mirror like I’m some kind of big shot.
Then my wife introduced me to Valerie Hays, and I realized how much more a person can do.

He looked at me and said, ‘but our special interests do good with the money.’

 An apologist is “one who speaks or writes in defense of someone or something.

 The English version of the Roman Catholic Missal changed at the start of Advent. The new translation is truer to the Latin original.

The response to “The Lord be with you,” change to “And with your spirit” from “and also with you.” The Latin, et cum spiritu tuo translates exactly into “and with your spirit.”
Another change that thrills conservative Catholics, is the consecration.

The story encourages and frustrates at the same time.
Encourages because we learn Davids can, occasionally, beat Goliaths. Frustrates because Goliaths tend to change the rules just before the epic battle.

That’s how the establishment wins—by establishing the rules. And changing them as necessary. Not exactly fair, but fairness isn’t in the rule book.

                The Gipper didn’t always follow his own commandment.
I’ve appreciated Newt Gingrich’s attitude during the 398 Republican Presidential debates. You know, his approach of refusing to attack his opponents.
He will, necessarily, change that approach a bit on the stump, but it’s been very effective so far. As Gingrich might put it, anyone on this stage will do a better job than Barack Obama.
And he’d be right.
But being right about that doesn’t mean candidates don’t have an obligation to show voters why they’re preferable to their opponents.

                Some center-right people take their ball and go home. Guess who?

Since the 2010 election, we’ve heard from the Establishment (GOP, MSM, DNC) that Tea Partiers are too puritanical.
The elitist theory holds that Tea Partiers demand doctrinaire allegiance to some engraved-granite list of principles. Stray from that list, and the Tea Party will hunt you down like a dog in the street and beat you with a Wiffle Ball bat until you pee blood for a week.

                I hear about it all the time. People are frustrated with me. With St. Louis Tea Party.
They&amp;rsquo;re frustrated because they hear about our events after the events.
That&amp;rsquo;s no good. We want people at the events. That&amp;rsquo;s what makes them events.
**What you asked for was some way to get a phone call about upcoming events. **
That&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable. The question is, how are we going to pay for it?

                The quality of the answers you get in life depend on the quality of the questions you ask.

Sometimes, though, when offered the chance to ask important questions, we ask questions about personal gain or immediate problems. That&amp;rsquo;s natural. Our brains are wired to prompt us with the urgent, immediate things in our lives.
But sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s not the best strategy. Sometimes we need answers to the bigger questions&amp;ndash;questions that may be crucial later.

                Like the Penn State athletic department, most St. Louis news media covered up a sex crime in order to protect an organization they love.
The St. Louis Post Dispatch, KTVI 2 and KPLR 11, and KSDK 5 each failed to report a sexual assault that took place at the illegal OccupySTL squatters&amp;rsquo; village in Kiener Plaza last week.
The assault came to light only because a citizen-journalist, the POed Patriot, monitors the police crime map.

Now, weather in Thailand&amp;ndash;and the tsunami in Japan&amp;ndash;threaten to upend American politics in the 2012. Your economic future could hang in the balance.

I was in New York last week. Every day I was there, I passed hundreds of people. Each day, I met a dozen new friends. Everyone in New York, it seems, is ready to smile and have a conversation.
I thought about some of these people&amp;ndash; the young couple holding hands, the young man with a hoodie a dozen tattoos, the two models (I was in that part of town) sitting in the hotel lobby talking on their cell phones.

When the GOP takes Washington (or Jefferson City), things don&amp;rsquo;t seem to get better. Wonder why?
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a little stroll down memory lane.
 &amp;ldquo;To secure the nomination, the Dewey forces spent money and made deals and promises that Taft would never make. Offers were made of Federal jobs that Delegates could not resist.

                Writers are always looking for the perfect topic for a book. But there’s a problem.
What’s important to me may not be important to you. And what you to read about, I might not care about.
That’s why great books achieve a certain universality. They touch on the essence of life itself, of humanity itself, of existence.
Some say that the secret to perfectly spellbinding stories is a mixture of just three elements: sex, food, and spirit.

                The Tea Party movement faces its greatest danger right now. The future of this country, therefore, straddles a sharp and angry line. One wrong move and everything that we’ve built over the past two and half years will collapse around us.

Occupy Wall Street is a communist idea built on the very same factors that inspired the Tea Party movement. If Tea Partiers let their disdain for the messenger distort our message, the American experiment will end.

With Christie out of the race, the money will flood toward the establishment guy, Romney. In other words, the race will be over before Thanksgiving. Romney will be the GOP candidate. Whether he beats Obama is a coin flip.
Romney will in the nomination, unless conservatives put country before pride.

                When Jay Nixon decided to ignore the voters, ignore the Missouri Constitution, and ignore the power of the legislature, he spit in our faces. But why?
Maybe because his special session is failing.
Maybe because, to save the centerpiece of that legislation, House Speaker Steve Tilley needed protection from the grass roots.
Maybe because Jay Nixon is as crooked as a dog’s hind leg and doesn’t give a hoot about you, your state, your country, or the law.

I have. They remind me of several things. My Uncle Patrick Mahon, for one. Uncle Pat and I watched M_A_S*H reruns every day at 4:00 when I was a kid. We met at my Aunt Mame’s house (unwed sister to Pat and my mom). Uncle Pat drank coffee—usually black with sugar—and smoked unfiltered cigarettes.
Uncle Pat retired from the St. Louis Fire Department in about 1976 (rough guess).

                You might have heard that Jefferson County Council was one of the happiest stories emerging from the 2010 election.
Well, some of the conservative champions who led the crusade to capture the council want to help more citizens become political leaders.
On Saturday, September 24, you can help. You can help while having blast of a good time in Crystal City.

Events all day long, including live music in the caverns from 7 to 9 pm.

When Mark Gillar of Tea Party Power Hour asked me to come onto his show, I broke my rule. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.
First, Mark Gillar&amp;rsquo;s professionalism and sincerity are spectacular. His show is his mission to advance liberty and good government.
Second, Tea Party Power Hour has hosted some amazing guests&amp;ndash;folks I&amp;rsquo;m very honored and very humbled to follow.

 As the marathon for the presidency, 1980, begins to quicken, the American electorate is in a singularly sour and pessimistic mood. Not only is the public naturally worried about the economy, energy and inflation, but it doubts things will improve much. The country is anxious to find strong leaders —the evidence is overwhelming—and the public has little faith that Jimmy Carter has the ability, let alone the programs, to solve the nation&amp;rsquo;s problems.

 On the razor’s edge of another recession; blocked at every turn by Republicans determined to slice him up at any cost; starting an unexpectedly daunting re-election bid; and puzzling over how to make a prime-time speech about infrastructure and payroll taxes soar, maybe President Obama is wishing that he had thrown the game.

One point that I should have made before being prompted by Ed’s speech. Trading Missouri sovereignty for a few pieces of ObamaCare silver is simple cowardice. Governor Nixon, and any Republican who voted for the healthcare exchange, should be retired—on their own or in a primary.

 The leftists dreamed. Visions of a union-boss oligarchy danced in their heads. Posters misquoted Marx and Lenin. Others wanted nothing to do with waiting two months for an election: they were ready to take up arms and violently overthrow the Wisconsin government.

                Warren Buffett makes the erroneous claim that he pays less in taxes than does his secretary. He claims that the government thus “coddles” the rich. He asks the government to increase his taxes, and the taxes of others like him, as if he is incapable of doing that on his own.
Buffett is half right. He proves that government coddles people by** asking the government to solve his problem of guilt**.

The big story is this: MoveOnUp.org has cheated history.
Why “cheated?” Because the past 50 years of American liberal history has prepared American blacks for one purpose: compliance.
Using victimhood, welfare, crime, destructive education, and programs designed to destroy families, American liberals from Ted Kennedy to Barack Obama chained African-Americans to “Uncle Sam’s Plantation,” as Star Parker so aptly puts it.

                Rule by the cleverest brute dominated most of human history. Then came the bizarre notion – in Greece and Rome to degrees, but mostly in the USA – of rule by the governed.
Rule by the governed gave way in 20th century to rule by experts.
Many so called “conservatives” warned against the expert thing. Eventually, conservatives believed, the experts would either fall prey to the clever brutes or to a world too complex for a small group to manage.

Sometimes the only option is humor. Maybe it’s time to laugh . . . at ourselves, at our pre-occupations, and at our president.
We elected him. And, in a republic, you always get the leadership you deserve.
Now what?
Now focus. Public displays of anger only hurt us. Anger is a tactic.
Yes, I’m angry. Furious. But acting out on anger does us no good. Instead, wise men and women focus that anger into a steely resolve to electorally destroy the cretins that destroyed America’s credit rating, liberty, and economy.

                Do you ever feel like Dan Blackford?
Dan is an original Tea Party organizer. He’s been at it since 2009. And he’s just about worn out. According to the Wall Street Journal, Blackford’s given up his position in the Houston Tea Party.
 All the protests, the organization, the fundraising, the block-walking, has it done anything? Are we better off than we were two years ago? I say &amp;lsquo;No.’
 How many other people feel the way Dan feels?

                It’s not the Balanced Budget Amendment, though that’s a good second choice.
It’s certainly not senseless and impossible ideas like impeaching Obama or suing over birth certificates.
Instead, we should push an idea that’s ripe for quick passage. It’s an idea that cheers political moderates and conservatives. And it doesn’t immediately turn off liberals.
What is it?
It’s an old idea that Jack Kemp championed for decades. It’s an idea that I’ve written about many times before.

                There’s hysteria on both sides. From Satan Sandwiches to “killing future generations,” you’d think Congress is voting on a bill to launch the US nuclear arsenal on Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.
There are reasons to distrust the deal. I distrust it.
There are great reasons todistrust the Congressional committee charged with finding more cuts.
The bill does far too little, too slowly, to prevent a credit rating cut in the near future.

No, the Tea Party is not the winner. (No one won.)
No, this debt deal won’t guide the government off the road toward bankruptcy. Here’s why.
  No Entitlement Fix: In fact, it appears that entitlements aren’t touched. Entitlements are the nation’s spending problem. Not roads and bridges, not the military. Entitlements. Until we arrest and reverse growth in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, we’re spitting in the ocean.

                Our present crisis is the result of:
** Too much borrowing ** Too much spending ** Too much government control ** Too much taxing
Those who argue that America needs to borrow, spend, regulate, and tax more are simply wrong, wrong, wrong. Their argument is absurd on its face.
The way to increase revenue to government is to increase the economic activity of the people. You do that by giving the people maximum control over their destinies.

Mike Flynn, the editor of Big Government, has quietly (and not so quietly) led the fight for liberty and good government for decades. His Big Government site has been a backbone in the resurgence of our first principles.

                Your FICO score is a number between 380 and 820 (or something like that) that banks use to determine your credit worthiness. The higher your FICO score, the better.
But that’s not what I’m talking about here.
I’m talking about your FICA score.

Your FICA score is the minimum payment on your federal loan.
You didn’t know you had a federal loan? You do.

Usually out of desperation. I’ve lied to those closest to me—those most willing to forgive the thing I lied about.
I’ve also told the truth to my own detriment. In the long run, the latter works best. In fact, telling the truth works best in the short run, too.
So maybe Obama’s desperate. Maybe he knows that the debt ceiling debate is the beginning of the unraveling of Americum Sovieticum, his life-long dream.

But the President lies.
Revenue from taxes and other fees would cover Social Security and other payments. What won’t be covered is additional borrowing to service the country’s already outrageous debt.

Jefferson was very opposed to federal government borrowing. (He was less concerned with states borrowing.) What I love about the quote below is Jefferson’s concern for leisure time.

Yes, I still believe that. Morally, at least. And you probably do, too.

The reason 4th of July creates Republicans has nothing to do with patriotism and everything to do with education. Here’s why:

Even though they became ubiquitous when he was an undergrad,Obama just now discovered that ATMs reduce foot traffic in banks. Then again, they probably didn&amp;rsquo;t have the machines in the Kremlin where he spent his semester abroad.
But the twits are sure having a blast with the news (me included).
Exit question: you think ATMs and airport kiosks are preventing people from finding work?

In this case, though, I&amp;rsquo;m referring to unemployment. Well, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m referring to the economy overall.

Obama has increased regulation, seized entire industries (auto, student loans, commercial banking, medicine), and borrowed more money faster than all previous presidents combined.
Obama is a one-dictator disaster. And an incompetent one at that.

I’ve met the former Missouri GOP head and former US Ambassador to Luxembourg a couple of times. Ann Wagner is smart, funny, and engaging. I think she’d make an outstanding Republican candidate for the US House. If elected, she’d serve Missouri well.
Missouri and the tea party won’t be the big winners if Ann Wagner gets the nomination, though. That distinction would go to the Missouri Republican establishment—the same establishment that the tea party hopes to reform or replace.

                There’s a “special” school in St. Louis County. Its seniors graduated on last Friday.

How sad it must be for those kids. They’re not graduating from the district’s “normal” schools with their peers. For various reasons, they’ve been relegated to a school for misfits.
Seeing the building makes the bad feelings worse. It’s a former grade school, crammed inconveniently behind a bank and a Taco Bell. Its Eisenhower era architecture stands out amidst its Mortgage Boom surroundings like a dandelion on golf course.

Brooks wrote of The Missing Fifth. **Did you know that 20 percent of American men in their primes don’t work? **
 Americans should be especially alert to signs that the country is becoming less vital and industrious. One of those signs comes to us from the labor market.

**Do you agree with Don Giljum’s statement “I believe in a violent overthrow of Bourgeois?” **
Before you answer, remember that Giljum’s use of the personal term “Bourgois” instead of the the class “bourguoisie” indicates that Giljim believes in violence against individual members of the middle class.

Missouri House Speaker Steve Tilley (R-Perryville) has signed onto legislation designed to circumvent the Electoral College in presidential elections. Like his position on embryonic stem cell research and the national debt, Tilley seems far out of step with Missouri’s Republican base on this. And this guy wants to be Lt. Governor? Please.

                Patrick Tuohey made some good points about the office of Lieutenant Governor. Based on that, I thought up all the possible reasons someone would run for LooeyG.
1. Stepping Stone: Establish state-wide name recognition and give yourself plenty of time to run for that next office, like U.S. Senate or Governor.
2. Party Reptile: If the governor is or is likely to be of the opposite party, you get to be the de facto head of your party in the state.

                Let’s face it: the Missouri GOP has become a club to advance the careers of a select few favorites. It is not a party to advance conservative principles.
And that needs to change here and now.
And that means some old names need to retire.
Here’s just one example of the ideological impotence of the Missouri Republican Party: The St. Louis County Assessor.
The GOP created the St. Louis County Assessor’s office because of corruption and incompetence in the political patronage version of the office under Democrats Buzz Westfall and Charlie Dooley.

Jake Zimmerman’s campaign rotates two themes:
  The St. Louis County Assessor should be a career political hack, not a seasoned real estate professional
  His little old friend, Margaret, is in danger of losing her home.
  But mostly St. Louis County government needs more Democrat political hacks.
Turns out that, just like Jake’s dad, his friend Margaret, a rather unsuccessful real estate investor, got a break on her property taxes.

 Most school systems don&amp;rsquo;t care about liberty; they care about conformity. The only way kids will learn an appreciation for the blessings of libertyis if their parents send them to schools that put liberty at the center of the cirriculum. That&amp;rsquo;s what Vacation Liberty School does.
  Many teachers would love to teach more about the blessings of liberty to their skulls full of mush, but they can&amp;rsquo;t.

Previously, she had charged taxpayers some of the cost of operating her private plane. Before that, it seems, she registered the plane in property tax-free Delaware.
On Monday, Claire wrote a $287,000 check without batting an eye. Now, St. Louis County says she owes them another $33,000 in interest and penalties, for a total bill of $320,000.

                Historians will mark March 19 as the day the Obama presidency reached its point of no return.
The image of a cowardly and selfish child-president flying to Brazil to launch a war will haunt his legacy, like Nixon’s vulgarities on tape in 1974. Obama’s war on Libya has doomed an already weak administration.
Today, Germany pulled out of NATO because of the bungled, late, and idiotic intervention. It appears, now, that the alliance that won the Cold War and help sustain two decades of peace could collapse under a lack of American leadership.

                What many people don&amp;rsquo;t get is that cooperation is not the same as consensus.

Cooperation means someone takes the lead on an issue. If it makes sense, and if the leader is perceived to have good character and judgment, others follow. Otherwise, the project is stillborn. It&amp;rsquo;s the way the market picks leaders. Not through org charts, but through action and response.
One person may be the leader on one issue and a cooperator on many others.

                When the US invaded Iraq in 2003, it do so with the clear intent of bringing its enemy—Saddam’s regime—to an unconditional surrender. That was the objective. Despite what happened after that objective was achieved, we went in with a clear and measurable purpose.
The motivating reason for our foray into Iraq was also clear. We believed at the time that Saddam Hussein’s possession of &amp;ndash; and desire for more &amp;ndash; weapons of mass destruction posed an imminent threat to US interests and citizens.

It’s bad enough that corruption, nepotism, and Machiavellian favoritism runs rampant in St. Louis County. What’s worse is that Dooley doesn’t seem to care what anyone thinks.

                According to a book by historians Neil Howe and William Strauss, history follows a fairly predictable pattern, rotating in cycles equal to a long human life. The book, The Fourth Turning, was written in 1997.
Read it.
If Howe and Strauss are right—and so far, they’re dead on—then we recently entered a Fourth Turning in the current saeculum which they named “millennium.”
What is a Fourth Turning?
 The Fourth Turning is a Crisis, a decisive era of secular upheaval, when the values regime propels the replacement of the old civic order with a new one.

                “Why would a nation become imperial?,” Steven asked me. “I mean, why would you want to take that on?”
The conversation had been on Japan leading up to World War II. The question was important. Why would a nation conquer dissimilar nations? Why accept that burden and risk?
My answer, which I’ve grown more fond of as time’s passed, was something like this: Imperial people view everything as a fixed pie.

But here are three scientifically proven steps to being happier. And since happiness causes success in other areas, not the other way around, these could be the most important tasks you perform.

Doing the right thing after years of practicing the wrong things is even harder.
When your senate separated the fiscal responsibility provisions affecting union collective bargaining powers from a bill that previously included tax and spend provisions, you took a big step toward fiscal recovery.
For years, public sector unions have dictated states’ taxing spending policies through brute force. These unions were not elected by the people, but the people were forced to pay—or borrow—what the unions demanded.

The problem with traffic signals is that they make all of the problems they’re designed to solve worse. By “all the problems” I mean: * Pollution * Congestion * Deaths * Accidents * Speed of Transit * Risk to pedestrians (except those with certain disabilities)
Banning red light cameras is a great first step, but the ultimate goal should be elimination of traffic lights altogether.

Look at what’s going on in Wisconsin. The people who represent the net tax payers—those who pay more in taxes to the state than they receive in salary—are being vilified, harassed, threatened, and assaulted by the net tax takers—those receive more in state wages than they pay in state taxes.

                I love getting lots of comments, and I encourage you to comment more. (Just say “hello” if that’s all you can think of.) But I want to clear up some misunderstandings about the way comments work.
Over the weekend, a commenter got quite upset at me because her words didn’t appear on my blog 30 seconds after she his Submit.
That’s by design.
My comments are moderated. Believe it or not, I attract lunatic-fringe commenters who like to describe the shape and smell of the bullet they intend to use on me.

                Two years ago today, fifteen hundred Americans took time off work, school, and leisure. You braved high winds and low temps to stand under the Arch and say, “We’ve had enough.”
Since then, over 1,000 state and federal offices have changed hands. In nearly 100 percent of these switches moves power from the privileged to the people. Some more than others. Some not enough. But an amazing reversal of trends, nonetheless.

                I continue hearing reliable reports that the GOP Leadership in the Missouri House keeps its boot on the throat of Tea Party freshmen.
What a shame.
The party that was flat on its back from 2006 to 2009 rose back to power because of the tea party. But, it seems, the Missouri branch of the party didn’t get the message. And its Speaker in the Missouri House has become tighter with left-fringe Democrats that with conservatives of his own party.

The National Education Association is a radical, political organization whose primary purpose is not education but control. Threatened with sensible legislation that protects the people of Wisconsin from unsustainable and unjustified retirement benefits, these teachers decided to shut down Wisconsin’s schools.

Republicans dominate both houses of the Missouri legislature. You’d think they’d act like republicans (lower case). But when it comes to education bribes from Washington, many of our Republican legislators show little resistance to political seduction. We can help them.

We are concerned that Senator McCaskill put her re-election before Missouri jobs by lobbying the DNC to hold its 2012 convention in Charlotte, NC, instead of St. Louis, MO.
Down the road, a group of Cardinals fans held a demonstration outside Busch Stadium. The future of future Hall of Famer Albert Pujols is important, too.

Keep that in mind for a moment while we look at the Obama Administration.

This ruling goes further than the previous Virginia ruling. Judge Vinson declared the entire Obamacare bill unconstitutional because the individual mandate portion is not severable from the rest of the law.
Third, Judge Vinson granted the plaintiffs “declaratory relief,” the functional equivalent of an injunction, freeing them from the burden of compliance.

                The news might seem unimportant to us in the USA:
 Day after day they marched, tens of thousands strong, defiant chanting demonstrators surging through the streets of Cairo, a capital unaccustomed to the shouts and echoes of dissent. The subject of their protest was the policies of Egypt’s supreme ruler, Hosni Mubarak. Some carried signs demanding his ouster. Others called for a return of long denied civil and political liberties and the enforcement of Islamic laws.

                Many of the people who support eliminating state oversight of the St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners are not conservatives. Decidedly not.
There are some good conservatives who disagree over the Board of Police Commissioners for the City of St. Louis. I’ve heard some of these conservative make some strong arguments for abolishing the board or relinquishing it to St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay.
Some of the arguments in favor of so-called “home rule” are flat out false.

In 2005, Reason Magazine posted an online debate between Friedman and Whole Foods Market CEO John Mackey. The debate coincided with the 35th anniversary of Friedmans’ famous The New York Times Magazine article entitled: : &amp;ldquo;The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits.

Suppose you did something stupid. You blamed the wrong person, for instance, for a capital crime. Then supposed one of your comrades compounded your . . . error . . . by threatening to kill someone on national television?
If you’re an American leftist, you might double down by issuing even more death threats to even more people.
That’s what’ happening right now in America. Death threats are pouring into Trent Humphries, Tucson Tea Party organizer, Dana Loesch, Sarah Palin (who vows not to be silenced), Glenn Beck, and more.

Dionne, Paul Krugman, others – have [executed a prepared propaganda war](https://hennessysview.com/crime/a-national-day-of-shame/) against anyone who disagrees with them. Their theorem is: vitriolic rhetoric inspires conservatives to act out in violence.
Unfortunately for the loony left, there was no evidence to support their theorem. The evidence they falsely pointed to—Jarod Lee Loughner’s deranged murder rampage in Tucson—was determined to be a lie only hours after the event.

                Last week, the Illinois legislature passed a massive income tax increase on individuals and businesses. Overall, it represents about a 67 percent income tax increase.
In response, neighboring states of Wisconsin and Indiana have wisely mounted massive campaigns to suck businesses and people out of Illinois. Even New Jersey’s fabulous governor, Chris Christie, plans to fish the Land o’ Lincoln for some business transplants.
One state bordering Illinois has been notoriously silent.

                Just as in 2001, some Republicans are falling for Democrat mind games. In 2001, it was the shared leadership arrangement in the Senate, even thought the GOP had the majority because of the VP tie-break. This year, it’s beginning with “bi-partisan” seating at the State of the Union address.
I have one message for Republicans: Knock it the hell off.
When a Democrat offers to reach across the aisle, with very few exceptions, it’s to poison a Republican.

I thought that most people who voted for larger government, higher taxes, tighter regulation, and limits on speech, religion, and assembly, were misguided.
I’ve always known and acknowledged that the people who advocated and plotted to concentrate power in the hands of a few were wicked creatures. I never hesitated to attack them head-on.

In the memo, obtained by Fox News and posted on Greta Van Susteren’s blog, the DHS agent openly speculates about undue internal influence. That’s because Loughner’s arrests don’t all end with reasonable closure, if you will.

These leftist cowards shut up only after it became undeniably clear that the evil bastard who shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 11 others is not a tea partier, but a deranged socialist.

                Update: Gateway Pundit has much more on the alleged shooter.
These appear to be the paranoid ramblings of the man in custody for shooting Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 11 others, including a federal judge, in Tucson, AZ. Lots of hard left references in his favorite books, including Mein Kampf and The Communist Manifesto. Politico’s Ben Smith calls Laughner’s writings “socialist.”

                Like all decent people, I am disgusted to hear the sad news out of Tucson, AZ: Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) was shot and killed along with four others today. Twelve were shot altogether. The murderer was apprehended by heroic bystanders and is in custody.
Not sure of the young murderer’s motives. I’m sure they weren’t worth killing or dying for. Except to him.
Please prayer for the souls of the faithful departed, the well-being of their families, the quick recovery of the wounded, and the delivery of justice.

Our work has just begun.
But we have the momentum.
Here’s how we need to deal with Congress:
1. We let them know what’s important to us.
2. We defend them—individually and collectively—when they do the right thing.
3. We remind them of their purpose, promises, and limitations when they stray.

                It’s 2011. The Tea Party movement is almost two years old.
Two years after the Boston Tea party, the Revolutionary War was well underway. In April, 1775, British Lieutenant General Gage sent troops to Concord, Massachusetts, to seize a garrison held by revolutionaries. It didn’t go so well for the Brits.

By 1776, the Continental Congress declared our independence from Great Britain citing human rights. With words that echo through the centuries, we declared that human beings have certain rights, and:

Last week, Klein unwittingly advanced the cause of dead constitutions. He did a better job than any proponent could. He said:
 The issue with the Constitution is that the text is confusing because it was written more than a hundred years ago.
 (William F. Buckley once described a statement like Klein’s as evoking of the sort of pity one feels for the ignorance of animals.

But don’t expect The 5000 Year Leap to change you. Or history. It won’t.
Now, if 70 percent of the US population read it, it might make a difference. Or maybe not. I tend to doubt it, but that’s fodder for a different post.
When tea partiers read books like Glenn Beck’s Common Sense or The 5000 Year Leap, we’re not broadening ourselves—we’re narrowing ourselves.

                Politicians don’t seek money. They seek power. They use money to acquire power. Once they have the power, money becomes irrelevant.
Did you see how states behaved last summer? The “Race to the Top” is all you need to know about the relationship between government money, power, and degradation.
The Race to the Top education initiative dangled cash in front of states. Most states, including Missouri, bit. They competed against each other for the privilege of surrendering their sovereignty over education to a DoE overlord.

 when extreme, prolonged, or contextually inappropriate, negative emotions can trigger a wide array of problems for individuals and for society.
 Phobias develop out of unchecked fear.

                How many new voters has the tea party movement created? There’s reason to hope that first time voters will begin shifting to the right in 2010. There’s also reason for us on the right to worry.
About 8 million people turned 18 since the 2008 election. While the left undoubtedly brainwashed many of them before they reached voting age, many others avoided indoctrination through good parenting, good thinking, or simply not paying attention to the left’s message.

Decide for yourself: here’s the link to Dana’s show.

A guy sitting behind me at a restaurant in Lambert airport began singing along with the background music. “Burning down the house (do do).”
Perfect.

November 2, American voters burned down the U.S. House. Before the vote, estimates ranged from 45 to 70 seats switching from Democrats to Republicans. Burning down the house, indeed. The final number was 63.

                Conservatives (tea party, et al) and Republicans better learn to get along. Quickly. Just as quickly, the two need to recruit, vet, and prep some A-list candidates. Candidates for offices from President down to school boards.
That’s because the winners in 2012 will either belong to a conservative coalition or the most radical elements of the Democrat Party. Here’s why.
Pollster Frank Luntz points out in today’s Washington Post that the largest ideological faction in the United States is the combination of GOP plus tea partiers:

Sometimes they don’t.
Salon carries a depressing story for the lower 48 of North America. Author Alfred McCoy writes:
 Despite the aura of omnipotence most empires project, a look at their history should remind us that they are fragile organisms. So delicate is their ecology of power that, when things start to go truly bad, empires regularly unravel with unholy speed: just a year for Portugal, two years for the Soviet Union, eight years for France, 11 years for the Ottomans, 17 years for Great Britain, and, in all likelihood, 22 years for the United States, counting from the crucial year 2003.

                We talk about liberty, limited government, freedom, Constitutional principles, and the like. Those are all relevant to the purposes of the conservative grassroots movement. But are they ends? Or are they just means?
I believe they are means. In the founders’ writings we find clues to the end, even they don’t state it explicitly. Jefferson did. Jay came close. And Adams implicitly understood that end.

Let me ask this: what’s the point of all the work we did in the past two years?

Before you answer, let’s look at some of the science behind giving. Then let’s look a little deeper.
Dr. Barbara Fredrickson studies the psychology of happiness. About a decade ago, Dr. Fredrickson announced a formula for creating an “upward spiral” of happiness. In other words, she identified what it takes to have happiness breed happiness. The formula applies to individuals, families, groups, and even companies.

  Balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.
  Elimination of earmarks until the budget is balanced, and then requiring a 2/3 vote.
  Audit the entire damn government, including the Fed.

                When Barack Obama became president in January 2009, he began a campaign to weaken America. I’m not talking about military cuts; I’m speaking of America’s stature. Barack Obama famously refused to acknowledge American Exceptionalism in 2009. He bowed to kings and princes, then denied doing so, then bowed again and again. His White House has driven down the dollar. Timothy Geithner, Obama’s Secretary of the Treasury, warns that the world economy must “rebalance” with less reliance on America.

Luckily for us, Senator-elect Roy Blunt showed his courage in a recent Wall Street Journal article about the Tea Party and the GOP.
In a year when voters overwhelming demanded changes to business as usual in Washington, Roy Blunt showed he has the rectitude to stand strong for the tried and true practices of obfuscation, political double-speak, and deflection.

How did this happen?
The town did the opposite of what had always been done. Instead of adding more traffic lights or signs or spy cameras, they went the other direction.

Because of the energy and enthusiasm in the room, the quality of the calls was fantastic. Veteran callers said that the people they spoke to were more engaged and pleasant than on past nights. That’s because success and energy drives enthusiasm, which people respond to even over the phone.

And in such a case my concern would be for the U.S. Constitution, not for my investment. The rooms, the rocks, the vegetation had no hold on my vital organs.

Don’t believe me? Here’s Woodrow Wilson, educator and president, speaking on the American plan for education:
 We want one class of persons to have a liberal education, and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class of necessity in every society, to forgo the privilege of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks.

He’s shown that the administration has no concern over the 2010 election because it has no intention of obeying the laws passed by Congress.

                Leftist philosophies lead to despotism. Despotism appeals to some people because:
  They don’t have to think.
  They won’t face consequences.
  Problems arise when the people who thought they didn’t want to think decide to think for themselves. Traditionally, the despots either kill or incarcerate the thinkers.
Eventually, too many people think, the prisons overflow, and the people kill or incarcerate the despot.
Instead of living through this cycle of violence again, why don’t we stop the despot now?

In what seems to have been a coordinated attack, Riverfront Times and several progressive blogs and web sites ascribed culpability for the crime to St. Louis Tea Partyers. At one point, Chad Garrison of RFT flatly stated that the suspect “fit the description” of a tea partyer, a statement he later attempted to soften by claiming that firebombing is “too sane” a crime for Tea Partyers.

Instead, the economy is now saddled with so much debt, so many regulations, and such onerous new taxes that the Obama Administration tells us to be happy with 9.5 percent unemployment.

Barack Obama is an economic disaster of the first order.

Douglas played William “D-FENS” Foster, an engineer at a defense contractor who has a really bad day. Some described the movie as “an ordinary man at war with the everyday world.”
Foster became an iconic anti-hero for the people who (stealing Bill Clinton’s line)worked hard and played by the rules, yet found themselves at the bottom of the heap in the post-Cold War era of 1993.

                The Wall Street Journal headline is grim:
   Grim Voter Mood Turns Grimmer  Underpinning the gloom: Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe the economy has yet to hit bottom, a sharply higher percentage than the 53% who felt that way in January.
Wow. I think thebarrage of terrible economic news this week has people realizing that you can’t borrow your way out of a debt problem.
So far this fiscal year, the US has paid more in interest on its rapidly rising debt than it’s taken in from all corporate taxes.

                A lot.
Today, Congress gave failing states and cities $26 billion in Chinese loans. More failed policies bolstered.
Today, the Federal Reserve Board reversed its plan to pay down the debt in order to put off economic downturn until after the election.
Today, the Fed announced that our future is bleak.
Today, we learned that the government probably overstated 2nd quarter economic growth—by almost double. (h/t Ed Morrissey)
Today, we learned that inventories increased because people and businesses aren’t buying.

                Congressional Democrats plan to hold a special session in August to pass yet another $26 billion bailout for states. Specifically for states that have create welfare empires they can no longer sustain.
So responsible states now have to pay for irresponsible states at the point of a federal gun.
It looks like the Democrats want to completely bankrupt America before they lose power in January.
Of course, this also gives empty suits like Russ Carnahan an excuse not to debate their opponents, talk to constituents, or hold town halls.

                As we approach the anniversary of Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream” speech, it seems we should both honor Rev. King and learn from that speech.
I can think of no better way to accomplish both goals than to liberally borrow from Simon Sinek’s fantastic blog post about that speech and the importance of living your “why.”
 On August 28, 1963, 250,000 people from across the country descended on the Mall in Washington, D.

                The only two people in the world who believe the economy is healthy and vibrant are Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

Now, the Federal Reserve Board’s Open Market Committee (FOMC) is getting ready to announce that the economy is sicker than we thought.
 Although Fed policymakers still believe the basic trajectory of the economy remains one of moderate expansion, there may be more attention given to heightened dangers of a sharp slowdown.

                No,not Marie Antoinette. Too clichéd and too . . . ancient. Rather, Michelle Obama’s opulent life rekindles fond memories of Imelda Marcos.
Imelda Marcos was the wife of Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos. Marcos was more a dictator than a president. Another parallel. In 1986, the Filipinos and the world had enough. Marcos was deposed and Imelda’s extravagance exposed.
Imelda Marcos’s closet contained 2,700 pairs of shoes. That’s a different pair of shoes every day for 7.

                I guess this is the Boy Scout Jamboree. It’s too wonderful to research.
On the big screen, we see The One, The Despot, Barack “Ass Kicker” Obama.
In the foreground, we see and hear Boy Scouts booing and mocking and jeering.

Part of me wishes the Boy Scouts were more respectful of the President of the United States, no matter who occupies that office. But another part of me believes that Obama is such a disgraceful, un-American anomaly that to disrespect him is to honor the United States.

                I received a couple of phone calls this morning. Maybe because of the primary election in Missouri. Or is the stifling, stale heat of August that drove the calls? Either way, I believe the calls represent very good news.
We survived The Dip (Godin, 2007).

Back in April, I sensed a dip in the burgeoning grassroots movement. By June 1, my suspicions were confirmed and I blogged about The Dip.

                On Tuesday, Missouri becomes the first state in the union to vote on ObamaCare. If being a Tea Partyer means anything, it means you vote Yes on Prop C on Tuesday. I urge not to wing it.
Most elections, I wake up and think “it’s election day.” Then I take a shower and go to work. I think about stopping to vote, but I don’t want to walk into the office at 9:00.

 Can a citizen decide not to buy health care services, and with that decision, not be required to buy health insurance?

                Just before her beatification, Shirley Sherrod jumped the shark.

On Thursday, CNN’s Anderson Cooper let the embattled former USDA director talk for an hour. Bad idea. It was bad for CNN, bad for viewers, and really bad for Sherrod, who lost her mind on the air. This is what she said:
 I think he’d [Andrew Breitbart would] like to get us stuck back in the times of slavery, That’s where I think he’d like to see all black people end up again.

Still, with each passing day and each new, permanent crisis, it seems like BO just ain’t up to the job of President. Nothing new. When Jimmy Carter’s incompetence became obvious, the lefty press developed a theory that the job had simply grown too complex for one man.

What Breitbart and Big Government did regarding Ms. Sherrod was identical to what every television news program does every day of the week. They produced a news story based on information reasonably available to them.

                Sometimes it is personal.

Beginning with a simple blog post in February 2009, the St. Louis Tea Party Coalition has attracted over 40,000 people to dozens of events and online crusades. The vast majority of these folks represent America’s highest ideals in character and citizenship. We are educated, polite, and patriotic. We are stand-up people who fix our own problems and earn our own livings. We are not perfect, of course, but we understand that no one else can live our lives for us.

That’s the scenario developing.
President Obama appointed a bi-partisan commission to make recommendations about the US government’s debt. The commission will not report out until after the November 2010 elections, but the leaders—Republican Alan Simpson and Democrat Erskine Bowles&amp;ndash;have given some warning about what we can expect.

 That&amp;rsquo;s why there have been signs in recent weeks that party leaders are planning an ambitious, lame-duck session to muscle through bills in December they don&amp;rsquo;t want to defend before November.

Today, Democrat Arlen Specter warned that he may have to vote “no.”
She might not be the infanticidal maniac some claim. Instead, she seems to be devoid of any substantial legal thought whatsoever.

                Sometimes things just happen.
As Jim Durbin points out, last night’s St. Louis Tea Party Night at the Ball Game was a total fluke. A mix-up left us with 46 tickets to last night’s Cardinal’s game against Arizona. (Long story.) But this tea party thing that started over a year ago seems to generate its own publicity.

But the real story, to me, is what happened last night. Three incidents vindicated the shift toward more community building work, even if that work comes at the expense of big, boisterous rallies.

                When a family’s children are small, the family has such unity of purpose. Mom, Dad, and all the kids climb into the mini-van or the SUV and head to the store. From there, they visit her parents. Then stop at McDonald’s on the way home. If one of the older kids is involved in an organized program, the whole family attends.

                Communist dictator Hugo Chavez has has stolen eleven oil rigs owned by the American company Helmerich and Payne. As Reuters points out, Chavez has now nationalized oil, telecommunications (including news), power, steel, and banking.
If you’re keeping score, Chavez leads Obama 5-3, as Obama so far has managed to seize only banking, automotive, and healthcare. But Obama has vowed a comeback.

 I&amp;rsquo;m doing it because I said I was going to do it and I think it&amp;rsquo;s the right thing to do.

                The stock market reacted mildly to some devastating economic news today. In fact, the stock market appears to be in denial about the state of America’s economy.
Existing home sales fell in May. As of this morning, economists expected a six percent increase.
Economists expect new home sales to be worse than existing home sales.
And economists expected home sales to fall off the table in July and for the remainder of 2010.

I do. I am concerned that we keep repeating the same tactics to the same audiences until both the audience and the actors become . . . well, bored.
When I read stories like this one, that GOP sentiment is at an all-time high, I worry that some on our side might decide they can go back to their regularly scheduled programming.

Major General Stephen Layfield, the reviewing officer at the Navy’s June 11 Boot Camp Graduation, introduced my son, AT Jack Hennessy, and 848 of Jack’s fellow sailors to America&amp;rsquo;s enemies. He mocked at our enemies’ plots to destroy America, pointing out that before him stood “eight hundred and forty-nine reasons why you’ll never succeed.”
The crowd of about 4,000 roared. The sailors, in ranks, could not even clap.

In less than twenty-four hours, the left has demonstrated its incapacity for civilized living by physically assaulting a college student, then exclaiming the virtues of physical assaults on reporters.
Background
A Democrat member of Congress assaulted a college student. The assault, shown on two video angles, was unprovoked (unless asking a simple, closed question is now cause for violence) andcontinuing long past the point at which the victim said stop.

If you live in Israel, you are not at peace. You are at war. War against a massive body of people who want to destroy you before they move on to destroy Christendom. If Christendom doesn’t destroy itself first.
So let’s all thank Israel for standing tall on the front lines of this epic battle between good and evil.

                A Washington Post/ABC News poll shows a major shift in sentiment toward (against?) the tea party movement.
I would not challenge the accuracy of the results which show the tea party’s popularity waning among Southerners and people 18 to 29. In fact, the poll shows that a full 50 percent of Americans now have a negative view of the tea party.
Sure, there may have been some chicanery with the questions to skew the results.

                Thirty-two years ago this month, the modern conservative movement was born.
The movement began with a local issue in a single state. Howard Jarvis of California succeeded in rolling back that state’s property taxes. Voters ignored Governor Jerry Brown’s apocalyptic predictions and captured the imaginations of a nation. After decades of government growth, the people of America’s largest state said, “Enough!”

While it’s understandable that a Christian church would treat Muslims as children of God, we are obliged to do so in the context of their prayerful conversion to Christ. Tolerance does not require submission.

When we built a levy to keep our village from flooding, or when we learned to lure and trap, then farm, animals instead of tracking them.

                Seth Godin is one of my favorite writers, thinkers, marketers, and presenters. Everything he writes is worth your time reading. Two of his books stand out for me. One is Tribes, because Tribes describes the whole Tea Party experience perfectly. And he wrote it a year before the Tea Party things started.
Right now, though, my other favorite Godin book serves as a question and a guide for the Tea Party movement.

                I ran to Walgreen’s at lunch. I needed some medication—maybe for a cold? I don’t remember for sure. While I was there, I picked up a Muscle Milk and a protein bar so I wouldn’t have to make another stop. I had only about 20 minutes to complete the circuit before my next meeting.
Returning to work, I hit a traffic jam in an unusual place. The outer road was backed up—something I’d never seen before.

                A few weeks back, the Christian Science Monitor asked me to write an op-ed. The subject was, “If the Tea Party ran America, how would things change; and why do you think you’ll win?”
The call was my opportunity to break from the easy, unassailable position that things are bad and getting worse. It meant coming up with a solution or two. And solutions already find disagreement somewhere.
For over a year I’ve said that the Tea Party movement, begun out of anger, must shift its energy over time from anger to solutions.

                It took almost three years of Jimmy Carter’s dangerously naive worldview before the world rushed in. By “rushed in,” I mean the Soviet Union rushed into Afghanistan, Iranian radicals rushed into the US Embassy in Tehran, and Cuban-backed communists rushed into every Central and South American country they could.
These aggressions resulted from a world perception that Jimmy Carter was unwilling to use America’s arsenal for good. Additionally, following Vietnam and observing American culture, the world surmised that:

As Peggy Noonan pointed out in a painfully honest Wall Street Journal column on May 28, we know now that Barack Obama is an empty suit, a child playing grown-up.

An additional crook in this den of thieves is Democrat Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Casey has introduced yet another bailout package. This time, the bailout is intended to repay corrupt unions like SEIU and AFL-CIO for bankrupting their members’ retirements by bribing the media and politicians.

 Although right now taxpayers could possibly be on the hook for $165 billion, the liability could essentially be unlimited because these pensions have to be paid out until the workers die.

                Celeste is an eighteen-year-old student in the Francis Howell High School.
Celeste’s fellow students and, apparently, a teacher named Debra Blessman are bullying and abusing the girl. Celeste’s sin? Conservatism.
Bob McCarty tells the story better than I can. Dana Loesch has been all over this story. There’s a facebook page dedicated to supporting Celeste, which everyone should like, even those of us who hate facebook.
I should point out that, to date, the school’s administrators are standing behind the abusive teach, Blessman, who calls Celeste a “tea bagger” and encourages the students to mock the girl.

Quit the SEIU. No decent person would belong to an organization that openly, and with the federal government’s approval, uses terrorism to get its way.

Guess what they show. Yep, you’re right! As temperatures rose on Earth, temperatures rose on the Moon.

Earlier this week, McGraw Milhaven of 550 KTRS criticized Tea Partyers for not opposing Missouri legislation, introduced by and championed by Republicans, that will force insurance companies to cover treatment for children diagnosed with Autism and associated conditions. (I personally oppose this legislation, by the way.)
Before that, a few Tea Partyers criticized me and others on facebook for not doing “enough” to support the Missouri Healthcare Free Choice act, which recently passed both the House and the Senate.

In fact, yesterday Danny Sullivan of Search Engine Land noticed that “how do i delete my facebook account” is now one of the top Googlesuggestions when typing “how do i …” in the search box.

This eighteen minute presentation synthesizes almost everything I believe about leadership and inspiration.
We own Why
We believe that God&amp;rsquo;s law trumps Man&amp;rsquo;s, and that the Constitution trumps Congress. And the President. And the courts. We believe that each one of us has the will and the capacity to dream our own dreams, live our own lives, and die our own noble deaths without government assistance or government contraints.

If you have friends or family in Pennsylvania&amp;rsquo;s 12th Congressional district, you might want to give them a call this weekend and ask them if they plan to vote in Tuesday’s election.

                I had a small revelation yesterday: there are two paths to focus.
One path requires constant vigilance against distraction. This path also demands great awareness of many things, knowledge, and outlandish tenacity. This is the path we recognize as heroic.
The other path gets less notice, less acclaim. Those how follow this other path to focus don’t seem to try hard. These are the “naturals.” Things seem to come easy for them.

                Happiness is a choice; anger is a tactic.
Anger will have to wait for a future post. This one is about happiness. So let me ask: would you do something that took less than a minute if that something would make you happier?
Martin Seligman at University of Pennsylvania’s school of Positive Psychology has broken down happiness in more scientifically measurable components:

On Saturday, a crowd of several hundred 9-12 Project and Tea Party organizers heard Ryun explain why it’s time to move beyond the rallies at the American Majority Post-Party Summit in Kansas City. I have mentioned this before, and it seems to bother many people. I understand why.

The rally was the animating function of the Tea Party movement.

At Tea Party marches and rallies, we are surrounded by others who understand and cherish liberty. We know the horrors that occur when a government loses accountability to and, yes, fear of the people they govern. Such regimes become murderous, intolerant, and repressive.

 S&amp;amp;P downgrades Spain to &amp;lsquo;AA&amp;rsquo; with a negative outlook, saying the country is likely to have an extended period of subdued economic growth.
 Markets react: DJIA plummets from &#43;23 to –22 in seconds after S&amp;amp;P drops Spain’s debt rating. And the sovereign debt nightmare is only beginning. The UK is next. But the USA borrows more money faster than anyone, and Socio-History blog ain’t happy:
As I pointed out yesterday, US debt threatens to end the economic stabilization.

                As I waited to appear on Larry Kudlow’s show last Friday, I heard Larry announce over and over again that he’s sick of hearing about Greece’s problems. Greece isn’t America. The U.S. economy is booming, and Greece can’t hurt it.
I didn’t tell Larry, but I think he was wrong.
Greece’s problems will hurt the American economy because Greece’s problems foreshadow a far more dangerous crash headed to America.

                I heard from my son, Jack, tonight for the first time since he left for Navy boot camp on April 14.
He is doing well. He survived the first week. He’s been declared fit for full duty. He’s learned to fold things very compactly, to recite the General Orders to the Sentry on command, and to identify his Chain of Command through the President of the United States.
If boot camp hasn’t changed, week two is worse that week one, but I didn’t tell him that.

A person with a powerful focusing ability gets as distracted as the next guy. The difference is that the Focus Master has learned to recognize distraction and gently guide his thoughts or actions back to the intended task at hand.
That simple skill is rare and remarkably powerful. Pay attention to every word of this two-step process:

                WASHINGTON, DC: The White House unveiled a new strategy to lower the nation’s unemployment rate, currently standing at 10 percent.
In his weekly radio address Saturday, the President announced that he will use remaining funds from the failed Stimulus bill to take advantage of little known variable in the unemployment rate factor: “discouraged workers.”
Pointing out that “discouraged” workers are excluded from the unemployment calculation, the President explained that the government will encourage the unemployed to simply give up hopes for finding work.

According to the forthcoming book, “Game Changing,” Reid described Obama a “light-skinned” black man “with no Negro dialect . . . unless he wanted to have one” during the 2008 presidential election.
In his apology, Reid said, “I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words, but it’s mighty white of the President to accept my sincere apology.

I began this book in December 2008, just after the election. My goal was to produce a book that would inspire people to restore our republic. At the time, conservatives were disheartened, dismayed, and distracted.
Then the Tea Party movement began, and I had to put my book project on hold. But thanks to your work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to return to my project.

                Usually, I’m against any government adding anything to its list of functions. But our friend Carl Bearden points out a novel and needed commission proposed by Missouri State Senator Gary Nodler. If enacted, Senate Bill No. 587 would require Missouri to establish a 10th Amendment Commission.
Here’s language directly from the proposed bill:
 The commission shall examine actions of the federal government toward the state, and refer cases to the attorney general when the federal government takes steps that require the state or a state officer to enact or enforce a provision of federal law that lies outside Congress&amp;rsquo;s enumerated powers and intrudes on the sovereignty reserved to the states by the tenth amendment to the United States Constitution.

 Dr. Benway is operating in an auditorium filled with students: “Now, boys, you won’t see this operation performed very often and there’s a reason for that…. You see it has absolutely no medical value. No one knows what the purpose of it originally was or if it had a purpose at all. Personally I think it was a pure artistic creation from the beginning.

                As a candidate, Barack Obama swore he would throw open the activities of government to light of public scrutiny. In his inauguration, he swore to disclose everything. As President, he has instituted strict rules of secrecy on White House actions&amp;ndash;except those of his predecessors.
Now, Newsweek&amp;rsquo;s Michael Isikoff, no friend of the right, notices the incongruity between Obama&amp;rsquo;s promises and his actual openess.

                One single legislative act will stop government overspending in its tracks.
In 1978, Representative Jack Kemp (R-NY) proposed legislation (which had no chance of passage in Tip O&amp;rsquo;Neill&amp;rsquo;s Democrat Congress) designed to stop the government from defrauding investors with inflation: bond indexing. The measure would have the additional value of discouraging government spending.
Ronald Reagan and Milton Friedman endorsed Kemp&amp;rsquo;s proposal. Let&amp;rsquo;s dust off this bill and push it through Congress as a memorial to Jack Kemp.

                In the battle between conservatives and statists, a fundamental difference seems to lie in the meaning of a concept found in the Declaration of Independence:
 Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed[.]
 The dispute is how men convey consensual powers to their government.
Conservatives believe that governmental power is conveyed exclusively through the Constitution; statists believe power is conveyed through elections.

Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp wanted to index everything, especially Treasury notes and taxes. By &amp;ldquo;indexing,&amp;rdquo; we mean tying rates (interest and tax) to the inflation rate. Calls for indexing subsided after Reagan and Volcker did what Ford and Carter could not: whip inflation now.

On Thursday in London, the President of the United States transferred America’s economic sovereignty from we, the people, to a small group of European central bankers.
In the words of former Clinton staffer Dick Morris, Obama “nullified the Declaration of Independence.” Specifically, Obama signed an agreement to create the Financial Stability Board comprised of European central banks and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.

Almost simultaneous with North Korea&amp;rsquo;s launching an ICBM in violation of international law and in defiance of US warnings, Barack Obama stood before the world and declared his intention to disarm the arsenal for democracy.

                The Obama administration has no intention of relinquishing dictatorial control of the banks according to financial expert Stuart Varney.  The government wants to control the banks, just as it now controls GM and Chrysler, and will surely control the health industry in the not-too-distant future. Keeping them TARP-stuffed is the key to control. And for this intensely political president, mere influence is not enough. The White House wants to tell &amp;lsquo;em what to do.

While Hennessy’s View has been critical of Waggoner’s leadership at GM, we oppose illegal and unconstitutional dictatorial powers in the hands of any US president.
Nothing in the Constitution permits a sitting president to direct a private company.

Tax Cuts: More voters than ever now say tax cuts help the economy.

A separate survey released earlier today found that 66% of voters think the president is likely to raise taxes on those who make less than $250,000 per year.

From The Weekly Standard:
 Some of the detainees, deemed non-threatening, may be released into the United States as free men, Blair confirmed.
That would happen when they can&amp;rsquo;t be returned to their home countries, because the governments either won&amp;rsquo;t take them or the U.S. fears they will be abused or tortured.
Blair said the former prisoners would have [to] get some sort of assistance to start their new lives in the United States.

Before Obama destroys your kids’ minds in his “let’s kill all the productive people” Nazi-Marxist youth camps, make them read the seminal work on conservatism by Mark Levin.
Having authored a Conservative Manifesto myself, I am confident that this book is the definitive thought on conservatism.
If you’re new to politics and activism, you need this primer. It will arm you with the verbal and intellectual ammunition you need send the scrawny rabble rouser we call a president back to the slimy rock he crawled out from under.

 Hello, it&amp;rsquo;s Lloyd Marcus, one of the spokespersons for the Our Country Deserves Better Committee. I&amp;rsquo;m active with this organization because I believe that Conservatism is compassionate and is the true path to achieving the AmericanDream. Liberalism weakens the human spirit by encouraging people to view themselves as victims.
 Besides political activism, my other great passion in life is as a singer, because that&amp;rsquo;s one of the things God gave me the greatest passion to pursue.

                The speed with which Barack Obama has seized—is seizing—private enterprise amazes even radical conservatives like me. Quite honestly, I am losing confidence in anyone’s ability to stop him from making the United States into a hip version of the old Soviet Union. In his first 100, Barack Obama will have transformed the US government, completely erasing Ronald Reagan’s presidency—as it the 80s never happened.
The New York Times piece gives a great example.

                The latest Rasmussen poll has bad news for Obama, good news for those of us who’ve been warning America how dangerous he is.
Highlights:
The number of people calling Obama “extremely liberal” has jumped 16 percentage points since the inauguration
Those expecting government spending to skyrocket is up to 72 percent from 54 percent on election day
Overall approval has fallen to &#43;4 percent from &#43;30 percent just after the inauguration

 I did not use the word &amp;ldquo;terrorism,&amp;rdquo; I referred to &amp;ldquo;man-caused&amp;rdquo; disasters. That is perhaps only a nuance, but it demonstrates that we want to move away from the politics of fear toward a policy of being prepared for all risks that can occur.

That’s America today. In the leadership vacuum created when the left eviscerated George W. Bush in 2006, America’s precarious imbalance seems improbable. Impossible.

 The leader of the nation&amp;rsquo;s largest veterans organization says he is &amp;ldquo;deeply disappointed and concerned&amp;rdquo; after a meeting with President Obama today to discuss a proposal to force private insurance companies to pay for the treatment of military veterans who have suffered service-connected disabilities and injuries.

THE MAGAZINE&amp;rsquo;S CREDENDA
Among our convictions: 1. It is the job of centralized government (in peacetime) to protect its citizens&amp;rsquo; lives, liberty and property. All other activities of government tend to diminish freedom and hamper progress. The growth of government(the dominant social feature of this century) must be fought relentlessly. In this great social conflict of the era, we are, without reservations, on the libertarian side. 2. The profound crisis of our era is, in essence, the conflict between the Social Engineers, who seek to adjust mankind to conform with scientific utopias, and the disciples of Truth, who defend the organic moral order.

                Rasmussen&amp;rsquo;s daily Presidential Approval Tracking numbers continue to show that Obama has lost more support in his first 50 days than any president since polling began.

Among the many factors contributing to Obama&amp;rsquo;s falling popularity, in my view, is his scattershot approach to the economy, inability to recruit and retain talent, and strong leftward lurch since taking office.
Americans do not want socialism. I hear over and over from disenchanted Obama voters that they didn&amp;rsquo;t believe he was a leftist as some on the right made him out to be during the campaign.

I know this is a little late, but I was waiting for Congress to spend another trillion dollars or so before committing my prediction to the public. Here goes:
GDP and unemployment will flatten and even improve a bit in first half of 2009 for a couple of reasons:
First, people will begin to look for excuses to spend money. This includes businesses.
Second, the hideous transfer of power from individuals to government that passed Congress on Friday will have a psychological effect on people making some believe that things will get better soon.

&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s real, and I&amp;rsquo;m a victim of it. I have the scars to prove it,&amp;rdquo; Williams told O&amp;rsquo;Reilly.
The left-wing smear machine includes The New York Times, Daily Kos, and others. As Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s forthcoming book, &amp;ldquo;A Slobbering Love Affair,&amp;rdquo; points out, this smear machine is a loosely but skillfully orchestrated consortium of radical, anti-American organizations that seeks, not just win at the polls, but to eliminate conservatism and Constitutional government.

Arctic Sea Ice Extend Growing
Not too long ago, Al Gore told German school kids that the North Pole, Santa, Polar Bears, and puppies would all be dead and rotting hunks of diseased fleshed in barren, desserts that were once the Arctic Sea by the time they entered high school. Turns out that the Arctic Sea Ice Extent for 2007-08 and 2008-09 is pretty much in the average for entire history of measured sea ice extent (1979 to present).

                The economy was just fine before you people elected a Democrat Congress. The Democrat party has controlled government&amp;rsquo;s taxing and spending policy since January 2007. In that time, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi, now joined by Barack Obama, have presided over the greatest market and economic crash since the Great Depression.
Everything They Do Makes Things Worse
The US and world economies have been in rapid decline since Pelosi picked up the Speaker&amp;rsquo;s gavel.

Barack Obama is now less popular than George W. Bush at the same point in their respective presidencies according to Rasmussen.
The poll also indicates that deficits are more important to Americans than anything else. This could be the result of theTea Party movement which drew more than 30,000 people in 40 cities to take to the streets over the weekend.
At this rate, Obama&amp;rsquo;s overall popularity will turn net negative this time next week.

                Dangerous Thoughts Standing in the Wings
_Why are you here? _I thought.
I was standing on the steps of the Arch fully aware that my fingers were painfully cold when the wrong thought crossed my mind. By &amp;ldquo;wrong thought,&amp;rdquo; I mean that one thought that will subconsciously sabotage the important or dangerous thing you are about to attempt. Like thinking, &amp;ldquo;what if the front wheel just fell off?&amp;rdquo; as you&amp;rsquo;re cruising down a winding road on a motorcycle, or &amp;ldquo;what if I forget my lines?

When Congress listens, it will repeal the trillions of waste, fraud, and abuse it has produced over the past 4 months, it will stop proposed borrowing and bailouts, it will stop rewarding bad behavior in corporations and citizens, or it will retire. This time, there are no two ways.
 Using tools like Twitter, email, and Facebook, TCOT has provided at least 163 patriots a forum to voice its discontent on Friday, February 27 at 11:00 a.

                A few weeks ago, shortly after his inauguration, Barry “The President” Obama panicked: the Republicans might talk the people out of the stimulus bill.
Barry moved quickly. But Barry is an organizer, not an engineer. He’s the cheerleader, not the quarterback. He moves mobs, not nations. And when panicked, he fell apart.
Barry decided to announce that life as we know it would economically end the Day After The Stimulus Bill Is Defeated.

                From his inauguration to the end of his first month in office, President Obama has dropped between 5 and 7 percentage points in approval according to Fox News and Rasmussen, respectively. That&amp;rsquo;s the largest first month drop in approval rating of any president since polling began. Barring a major plebiscitory reversal in 2010, Obama will go into the 2012 election with no scapegoats and no Congressional help. The Democrat Congress under Reid and Pelosi is the least popular since polling began, and Reid and Pelosi promise to deliver more of what made them so unpopular.

                Yesterday it seemed that Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s principal goal in China was to detach human rights from . . . well, from everything. Today&amp;rsquo;s Washington Post reveals the real purpose of her trip: sales.
Barack Obama has, in a month, made George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s deficits look like surpluses. And he or his cabinet members promise about another $1.5 trillion in direct debt before the fiscal year ends in September.
To finance this socialist expansion of government, Obama must sell bonds and lots of them.

Okay.
Obama’s First Decision Was Disaster
During the campaign, Joe Biden was a laughing stock, relegated to the safe, blue states where—Obama hoped—the press would ignore him. They did not.

No, wait. He is the dumbest man. And the whiniest. This is like listening to my kids complain about homework. Obama has no understanding of basic economics. He lacks any knowledge of the Great Depression. He seems to actually believe that the New Deal significantly reduced unemployment.

                The Constitution enumerates certain powers to the US government. Chief among them is national defense. Barack Obama, in his campaign and in his first two weeks as president, has demonstrated a callous disregard for that duty. His actions threaten to place Americans in grave danger. Safe Since September 11, 2001
Like many, I assumed that Islamofascist terrorists would strike the US within a month or two of 9/11. The reasons were obvious at the time: we were woefully unprepared, panicked, and confused.

Since the white, Republican folks in Appalachia fit none of these categories, Obama’s happy to watch them suffer and die.

I based[ my prediction of oil in the $30s](https://hennessysview.com/2007/11/13/oil-price-collapse-coming/) on the simple fact that the experts agreed we&#39;d never see oil below $100.

Yesterday, Michelle was still the #1 conservative blog&amp;ndash;at 39 overall. Huffington Post is #1, Kos is #8.
Why?
Reason 1: Focus
Or lack thereof. The rising stars of the right aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily political, but scientific.

                For months I&amp;rsquo;ve been echoing the warnings of Peter Schiff and others: when China stops buying American debt, we&amp;rsquo;re in deep, deep trouble. The possibility for hyperflation, prices rise by double-digits on daily or weekly measures, becomes palpably high.
Even though this article from IHT failed to suprised me, I have a sick, frightened gnawing in my stomach:
 China has bought more than $1 trillion in American debt, but as the global downturn has intensified, Beijing is starting to keep more of its money at home - a shift that could pose some challenges to the U.

The United States and every country on earth is in a perilous position right now. The world economy is on the brink of depression. Bad business practices driven by even worse government policies and regulations have destroyed $ trillions in wealth and left us on a narrow, swampy peninsula between deflation and hyperinflation.

                The first time I met George W. Bush in person, I was campaigning for Jack Kemp for President. Kemp was running against Vice President George H. W. Bush (and 47 others) for the Republican nomination. This was 1987.
A wonderful, tough, and tireless local Republican organizer named Thelma Stuart recruited me and served as my mentor in Dixiecrat-style politics of South Carolina. My first gig was manning the Kemp booth at the Low Country Stump Days in Charleston.

In yet another egregious display of Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) arrogance, he changed the temperature data from 1910-2008 to reflect what is clearly a cooling trend to reflect a warming trend.

 Just mindblowing. Here is #44 today (via the AP):
 Obama said Tuesday the deficit appears on track to hit $1 trillion soon. Speaking to reporters after meeting with top economic aides, Obama said: &amp;quot;Potentially we&#39;ve got trillion-dollar deficits for years to come, even with the economic recovery that we are working on.&amp;quot;  If Obama really believes that the world economy will tolerate annual deficits north one trillion dollars, he will receive a belated economics education in short order.

When Al Gore speaks, the opposite happens. Where Al Gore goes,snow is sure to follow. So when Al Gorefrightened a bunch of German kids by telling them that the North Pole would be gone in 5 years, that Santa Claus would die along with his reindeer, and that Polar Bears would either become extinct or catch the last few ice floes south to Europe where they&amp;rsquo;d &amp;ldquo;eat little kiddies like you,&amp;rdquo; you just knew that the Arctic would grow ice faster than Joe Biden&amp;rsquo;s head grows hair plugs.

If Barack Obama sends a $300 billion tax cut proposal to Congress as the meat of his stimulus package, he deserves high marks.
Tax Cuts Increase Tax Revenue
A large tax cut aimed at tax payers&amp;ndash;individual and business alike&amp;ndash;will not only stimulate the economy, it will increase federal revenue, defraying the irresponsible and dangerous spending of Paulson and Bernanke. As Kennedy, Reagan, and Bush 43 understood, tax cuts, to a point, increase federal revenue.

Strike One: How Al Gore (and Hansen and the rest) lie to you about climate change:
 First, the expression &amp;ldquo;climate change&amp;rdquo; itself is a redundancy, and contains a lie. Climate has always changed, and always will.

When a team of governors demands that the federal government steal wages and profits of the citizens and transfer those monies to state governors to dispense as the governors see fit, one wonders whether or not the disease is now the norm.

I&amp;rsquo;m into my third month of acquiring positive habits with Leo Babauta&amp;rsquo;sZen to Done method. At the same time, I&amp;rsquo;m working the 30 day challenge. What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far is that I hold onto too much.
 * I carried around anger and frustration over missed goals and failed or abandoned projects * I vilified good people (in my mind) because I wanted to get my way all the time about everything * I sabotaged myself by trying to do everything anyone asked of me * I was afraid to look weak, and that fear weakened me  The faultering economy, no doubt, led me toZen Habits, which led me to Zen to Done, which led me to &amp;ldquo;The Power of Less,&amp;rdquo; which led me to theSedona Method, which led me here.

The 1960s started with JFK&amp;rsquo;s assassination&amp;ndash;until then, they were a lot like the 50s except with a young president whose economic policies were to the right of his Republican predecessor&amp;rsquo;s.
The 1970s culturally started with Woodstock in 1969. As Hunter S. Thompson pointed out in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Woodstock was not a celebration but a funeral. It marked the end of the hopeful part of whatever the 60s were and the beginning of the malaise of the 1970s.

Why are these books so important? Because life changed in 2008. The commitments we’d made as individuals, families, communities, nations, and the world received a margin call.

                After a 2 year hiatus from annual predictions, here&amp;rsquo;s what I see happening in the precarious Year of our Lord Two-thousand nine:
The Dow: The Dow trades within a range of 1,000 points with a daily average closing of 8,500.
GDP and Economy: By July, everyone pretty much calls the situation &amp;ldquo;Great Depression II.&amp;rdquo; Unemployment, which declines in the first quarter, increases to more than 12 percent by fall. Gross Domestic Product by quarter:

                Israel&amp;rsquo;s assault on Hamas terrorists in Gaza continued for a second day. As if reading from a script, the UN Security Council called for an immediate stop to Israel&amp;rsquo;s self-defense. As the air strikes continued, Israel has moved more troops and tanks to the border, possibly in preparation for an incursion into the area now under terrorist control.
Some internation responses were less than predictable, though. France, for instance, demands first that the terrorists stop pitching rockets at Israeli school kids, then that Israel stop its air assault.

 First, all over the world, temperatures have been dropping in a way wholly unpredicted by all those computer models which have been used as the main drivers of the scare. Last winter, as temperatures plummeted, many parts of the world had snowfalls on a scale not seen for decades.

                The increased urgency to legislate or judicially impose new, draconian burdens on society to &amp;ldquo;save the planet&amp;rdquo; is not your imagination. Neither is it a response to increasingly rising temperatures. Temperatures have been falling for 8 years now, and have not risen in more than 10. The reason the AGW alarmists need to impose restrictions is: credit. Remember the ozone holes? According to leftists, the holes were caused by chloroflourocarbons like refrigerant used in air conditioning.

                Even as CO2 levels rise, western Lake Superior is freezing over for the first time years.
 The western tip of Lake Superior has frozen over in December for the first time in recent memory, and that could mean a long season of ice angling that hasn’t been seen in years.
 “We were just talking that it’s been something like 17 years since we had a good, long ice fishing season at this corner of Lake Superior,’’ said Russ Francisco, owner of Marine General sporting goods store in Duluth.

The Arab world (yawn) reacted predictably, condemning Israel (yawn) and staging street protests (yawn). I&amp;rsquo;m sure many a rifle was fired into the air.
The left&amp;ndash;and I suspect Barack Obama is included&amp;ndash;will decry Israel&amp;rsquo;s self-defense. They will call for Israel to show restraint. They will call on Israel to take another body blow.

 John Brennan, Obama&amp;rsquo;s chief intelligence adviser and anticipated CIA chief, was recently forced to withdraw his name. There was no drumbeat of opposition to Brennan from the front pages or on cable. Rather, the pick was torpedoed by the blogosphere.
 &amp;ldquo;Apparently there is a lot of pressure on the Obama team from a blog saying that Brennan couldn&amp;rsquo;t be made the director of the CIA because he was involved in torture and renditions, which he wasn&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; said Mark Lowenthal, former assistant CIA director.

                Rarely does a single factor cause a paradigm shift. For one example, look at the election of Ronald Reagan. Sure, Reagan had a great message, expert delivery, and that presidential look. But without Carter&amp;rsquo;s bungling incompetence, excesses by liberals in Congress, a runaway Supreme Court, Soviet expansion, stagflation, the Iranian hostage crisis, and seventeen thousand other annoying problems, Reagan would not have upset an incumbent president in 1980.

Mark the date: according to Gore, on 12/12/2013, there will be zero ice north of the Arctic Circle. This would an amazing change in trends since global sea ice has been growing for 20 years now.

For 40 years&amp;ndash;since the introduction of Japanese cars in the US market&amp;ndash;these whining, overpaid slobs have bilked consumers for billions, insisting that they deserve to be overpaid simply because there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of them.

Robert Rubin abandoned the Clinton administration when a recession was unavoidable. His relief was his protege, Larry Summers.
Robert Rubin talked the Citigroup board into investing in extremely high-risk mortgage-backed securities. He also showed the bank how to carry those risks off the books&amp;ndash;exactly the way he showed Enron how to do it.

 Al Qaeda is out of practice. The terror organization has been quite since 2001, pinned down inside in Iraq where our heroes destroyed their efforts to establish a beach head.
The coincidence of the horror in Mumbai with the FBI reports of a serious, legitimate threat to the NYC subway system seems coordinated to me.
Since 9-11, the US, UK, and Israel have trained and developed anti-terrorism techniques jointly with many nations, including India.

                Since no one else will listen to his lies, half-science, and hysteria, the old man of GISS wrote a long letter to the president-elect.
Luckily for the rational world, Richard Courtney (pdf) excoriated Hansen for the letter and for Hansen&amp;rsquo;s continued crusade to end freedom as we know it. Courtney&amp;rsquo;s summary of Hansen&amp;rsquo;s conclusion may go down in annuls of the AGW debate as a masterpiece:
 That &amp;ldquo;conclusion&amp;rdquo; may be correct if it were based on evidence and reasoned argument, but - as explained above - it is not.

                The Internet&amp;ndash;the engine that drove year-over-year increases in sales since its inception&amp;ndash;is unable to overcome the economic malaise in America.
 For the first 23 days of November, online sales declined 4% to $8.2 billion from $8.5 billion the same time last year, according to market-research firm comScore Inc. The firm projects that retail spending online in the months of November and December will total $29.2 billion, flat from the same period last year &amp;ndash; a dreary sign for online retailers, many of which had grown accustomed to double-digit gains.

                Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats could be headed toward a final showdown over abortion and the right of men and women to choose their moral direction.
Obama has promised in bold and belligerent words to make the Freedom of Choice Act his first, most important act as President. Consistent with his lifelong passion for encouraging abortion, even encouraging his daughters to have abortions, Obama&amp;rsquo;s first act as President will be to drive a permanent wedge between the United States and the Catholic church.

                While we in America credit Ronald Reagan with saving modern conservatism and the Western World, it was Margaret Thatcher who preceded Reagan and set the world stage for his entrance, stage right.
Thatcher rose to the top of British government in response to decades of expensive, debilitating leftward drift in Europe. The countries of NATO faced a long series of self-inflicted financial crises, the KGB incited their youth toward socialism and Sovietphilia, and taxes were out of control.

                The US Government is now on the hook for $7.7 trillion in bailouts and guarantees trying to stave another Great Depression [source]. Mathematically, the government&amp;rsquo;s scheme cannot work.
Bailout Costs in Perspective
World War II cost about $2.1 trillion in 1990 dollars, which I calculate to be $3.5 trillion in 2008 (assuming 2.8 percent inflation over the period.). (San Francisco Chronicle puts a $5 trillion tag on WWI, though.) It took 50 years to pay off that debt.

Government intervention in the private problems afflicting General Motors, Chrysler, and the finance business effective reward poor leadership. Leaving executive compensation off the table completely, the government should foster a healthy climate for business, but no more.

He further recommends adopting the habits in the order presented in the book and warns that the temptation is to follow the advice of most similar systems and attempt a dozen new habits all at once.
Since I have none of the positive habits recommended in ZTD or in David Allen&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Getting Things Done,&amp;rdquo; which I&amp;rsquo;ve been re-implementing for nearly a decade, I decided to follow Babauta&amp;rsquo;s advice to the letter, with on exception: I use a digital notebook.

The report calls the present financial mess the worst in more than half a century, carefully avoiding direct references to the Great Depression.

                From Rich Lowry (editor of National Review) to Norman Ornstein (American Enterprise Institute), conservatives cry out for &amp;ldquo;message that resonates with young people and minorities.&amp;rdquo;
Hogwash.
Barack Obama won the election because, given the choice of two vacuous and banal &amp;ldquo;messages,&amp;rdquo; voters went with the more interesting one.
Blaming conservatism, Reagan, Christians, and clingers for the 2008 election results betrays a kind of ignorance for which non-profits raise funds to cure.

                According to reports, Barack Obama will spend most of the afternoon of January 20, 2009, signing Executive Orders to ban or limit activities that produce CO2. Bankrupting the coal and steel industries apparently can&amp;rsquo;t wait for legislative action.
Why the rush? Why is Obama in such a hurry to put tens of thousands of people out of work?
Obama and the left want to get CO2 laws in place so they can claim the laws stopped and reversed global warming.

And it reminded me of a great reason to celebrate. Let me explain.
I was born in 1963 when there were still &amp;ldquo;Colored&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;White&amp;rdquo; drinking fountains. Obama&amp;rsquo;s a few years older.

Americans, faced with the choice of Marxist-socialism or republican-capitalism, a plurality chose communism.
Their moral weakness, combined with viral corruption of character, has created a majority coalition of indecisive morons known as independents, children who want government to make their decisions and butter their bread, and neo-Marxists, like Obama. We fought the Cold War for nothing.

&amp;ldquo;It was remarkably efficient,&amp;rdquo; said Philly Mayor Nutter (D). &amp;ldquo;We managed to break voting records without forcing people to leave work early or find the polling places. This is a model for the country.&amp;rdquo;
For the numbers, 127 percent of the eligible voters were represented in the final number, and nearly 1,800,000 votes cast.

According to Obama himself this force will be armed and funded as heavily as the US Armed Forces. Unlike the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marines, this force will aim its destructive power on political dissidents.
&amp;ldquo;We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we&amp;rsquo;ve set,&amp;rdquo; Dear Leader said Wednesday.

                At the current rate of decline in Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s definition of &amp;ldquo;the rich,&amp;quot; by June 2009, anyone earning more than $20,136 a year will get a tax increase.
Since July 2008, Obama&amp;rsquo;s definition of rich has been declining at rate of 20 percent per month. Simple extrapolation shows that even minimum wage earners will face a tax increase by the time any legislation can be enacted in June 2009.
In other words, Obama&amp;rsquo;s real definition of &amp;ldquo;rich&amp;rdquo; is: &amp;ldquo;you have a job.

                After a week of steady gains in polling, McCain is now 1 point ahead of Obama according to Zogby.
Some call the Friday poll an anomaly, but there&amp;rsquo;s reason to believe it&amp;rsquo;s not.
Joe the Plumber and Tito the Builder resonate with an increasing number of voters. These are ordinary Americans who work hard to make a better life for their families. Obama and the leftist press attacked them viciously for deigning to challenge the American Lenin&amp;rsquo;s right to ascendancy.

 Obama has been encouraging voters to go to the polls for early voting. The Democratic nominee . . . released a new 30-second spot on his Web site urging voters to &amp;ldquo;talk to your boss&amp;rdquo; or professor and then take the day off from work or school to volunteer for his campaign on Election Day.

                In an NPR interview in 2001, Barack Obama admitted that he despises the US Constitution because it limits government. He stated that the Warren Court did not go far enough in redistributing wealth. In essence, the tape confirmed conservatives&amp;rsquo; worst suspicions of Obama&amp;rsquo;s motives. Last night, I blogged on light side, asking those who support Obama whether or not they&amp;rsquo;re ready to change the US form of government. I tried to make the case that Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s long associations with admitted communists and terrorists, combined with expected Democrat control of both houses of Congress, placed at risk the idea of self-government, limited in its powers by a Constitution written by the People and enumerating those particular powers that we cede to the government.

                Among the most important titles we have in the Catholic Church for the Blessed Virgin Mary are Our Lady of Victory and Our Lady of the Rosary. These titles can be traced back to one of the most decisive times in the history of the world and Christendom. The Battle of Lepanto took place on October 7 (date of feast of Our Lady of Rosary), 1571. This proved to be the most crucial battle for the Christian forces against the radical Muslim navy of Turkey.

I understand that many Americans are upset with the current conditions in the country. You believe that George Bush mishandled the war in Iraq, at least for a couple of years. While you&amp;rsquo;re willing to concede that the news media intentionally misled you about American successes in Iraq, you saw enough to conclude that the Administration made some mistakes&amp;ndash;and those mistakes cost lives.

The company used those profits to fund this year&amp;rsquo;s growth investments: hiring new employees, advertising and sales, research and development. Because the company&amp;rsquo;s strategy is to fund all growth with internal profits, it keeps a healthy bank account to continue operations should a large client leave the firm or should the economy turn down.

Barack Obama has a college education, political office, and a name because he black and from a broken home. He happened to hit college age when it was still vogue to promote minorities through the education system, including Harvard Law, regardless of their abilities.

                Yesterday I participated in a roundtable discussion on the economy and how we can help our customers through the rough times ahead. At the outset, I cautioned participants against the tendency to look toward recent economic slowdowns for guidance: &amp;ldquo;this isn&amp;rsquo;t like 1991 or 2001,&amp;rdquo; I told them. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll have to go back to 1979-83 or 1929-42 to find a parallel.&amp;rdquo;
My fellows flashed looks at me, then at each other.

It&amp;rsquo;s possible, of course, that McCain is simply inept at closing the deal. As every baseball fan knows, closers don&amp;rsquo;t grow on trees. Many fine pitchers flounder in the ninth inning with a narrow lead. They&amp;rsquo;re not all Bob Gibson.

Financial Armageddon
In case you were too busy with your normal life and missed it, the financial armageddon promised/threatened by President Bush, Nancy Pelosi, Hank Paulson, and every other power freak on the planet failed to materialize. The Dow ended up 485 points, erasing well over half of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s losses. Before Congress does something stupid, let&amp;rsquo;s just see what happens if we, the people, are left to our own devices&amp;ndash;the way the founders planned it and the way it worked for 150 years before do-gooder morons fucked everything up.

Mercury News:
 Barack Obama made the calamity on Wall Street the central theme of his case against John McCain on Saturday, invoking the crisis to pound his rival on Social Security, health care and government reform.
 Let me get this straight: The highest-paid Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac politician on the planet wants to blame the financial crisis on the only politician whom Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were unable to bribe!

Therefore, criticizing any black is racism.
I&amp;rsquo;ve criticized and accused Franklin Raines brutally in the past two weeks, so I must be a regular David Dukes. Perhaps Karen Tumulty needs to change her meds.

As an executive at Fannie Mae, Franklin Raines illegally coerced his employees to falsify accounting facts so he&amp;rsquo;d get a maximum bonus. The government-backed firm used Enron-like fraud, in part at Raines&amp;rsquo;s orders, to create the largest bail-out in US history.

Ever since Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s meteoric rise into political stardom, political junkies left and right have speculated that Team Obama could dump Joe Biden (due to some unfortunate family issue like Joe&amp;rsquo;s emerging pro-life stance) and replace him with Hillary Clinton. Think of it as second life for Rush Limbaugh&amp;rsquo;s Operation Chaos which extended the Democrat Nomination fight right up to mid-June. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore what that scenario might do to the race.

Biden must have a very difficult time reconciling that belief with his public support of abortion rights. If he truly believes that life begins at conception, supporting abortion under and circumstances is tantamount to advocating murder.
Biden admits that he cannot fully reconcile the two opposing views:

                If you missed FoxNews&amp;rsquo;s Sunday new program, you missed a beautiful undressing of a liberal lie.
Juan Williams, defending Barack Obama, said that Americans were sick and tired of the wealthy not paying their fair share of taxes. Juan was flat out angry.
Brit Hume elegantly and calmly informed him, &amp;ldquo;Juan, the top 1 percent of income earners are paying a higher percentage of the total federal revenues than ever before.

                This degenerate America-hater who goes by the name Charley James claims to live in Toronto, and claims to have friends in Alaska. He has earned his 15 minutes of fame by giving himself a Peyote enema and making up a ridiculous story about Sarah Palin complete with a fictitious waitress named &amp;ldquo;Lucille,&amp;rdquo; a name he probably pulled from Hunter S. Thompson&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.&amp;rdquo; (I don&amp;rsquo;t have the book in front of me, but I believe that Lucille was the name of the maid that Duke&amp;rsquo;s attorney attacked in the hotel room when the attorney mistook the maid&amp;rsquo;s mop for an axe handle.

                Today the St. Louis Rams played the worst game in the history of the oft-horrible history, losing 38-3 to a mediocre Philadelphia Eagles team.
Watching the game on a big, HD television made the spectacle ever more frightening. The incompetence, laziness, lack of preparedness, inept game planning and powder-puff tackling seemed to delight head coach Scott Linehan, who believes winning is over-rated.
Linehan&amp;rsquo;s remarkable leadership and motivation worked magic on new offensive coordinator Al Saunders.

                Two polls&amp;ndash;Zogby and Gallup&amp;ndash;now have John McCain and Sarah Palin leading Barack Obama and Joe Biden by 4 and 3 percentage points, respectively. Both leads are beyond the margins of error.
Clearly, the voters like what they see in McCain and, especially, Palin. These results also validate the idea that Democrat lies and smears aimed at Palin are actually helping the GOP ticket.
As a result of these numbers, Barack Obama has abandoned the traditional, academic definition of recession, and breaking another promise to his far left supporters: he will extend the Bush tax cuts in order to help the economy.

                The messiah today told ABC News that he considered joining the military, only there weren&amp;rsquo;t any big wars going on at the time.  But keep in mind — I graduated in 1979. The Vietnam War had come to an end. We weren&amp;rsquo;t engaged in an active military conflict at that point. And so, it&amp;rsquo;s not an option that I ever decided to pursue.
 I guess we&amp;rsquo;re all stupid enough to believe that had Vietnam dragged on a bit longer, Obama would have marched his scrawny ass down to the nearest Marine Corps recruiter and signed up for infantry.

                We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard John McCain&amp;rsquo;s horrible experience in Vietnam. I&amp;rsquo;ve never before heard him tell it.
What strikes me is the enormous contrast between him and Barack Obama. John McCain has lived a noble, heroic, remarkable life. Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s read about such things.
John McCain left it all on the battle field, then in a POW camp, then in hospitals where he gave his all for his country. Barack Obama took everything he could get his hands on: money from a convicted slum-lord felon, street cred from bigotted America-hating minister, political favor from a convicted anti-American terrorist.

   And, believe it or not, this advice might be worth something: I caution liberals, both in politics and in the media (same diff, right?), not to let Palin drive them nuts. A lot of conservatives — a lot of us conservatives, I might say — were driven nuts by Clinton. We were driven nuts by his enduring popularity in the face of tremendous misdeeds.

 They say I lack experience. They&amp;rsquo;re right, in a way.
 I have no experience wandering a city for three years trying to find myself. No, I&amp;rsquo;ve never had that luxury. But Barack Obama has.
And I have no experience funneling money from an educational trust into organizations run by my close friend, the convicted terrorist. No experience at all.
Nor do I have the experience of having a political career launched by a pair of terrorists who tried to blow up the Capitol and the Pentagon, who succeeded in killing a police officer.

                Despite promises from Barack Obama that his campaign would drop attacks on its Republican rivals during Hurricane Gustav, that walking hunk of excrement, Joe Biden, broke the promise and ripped into John McCain today during a stump speech.
 The only guy in America in a position of some authority who is out of sync with the whole rest of the world is John McCain.
 Earlier in the day, Biden skipped out on a planned appearance at Labor Day parade in Pittsburgh, Pa.

Outstanding. I watched and heard the interview, and I have no doubt he meant what he said. His vigor was sincere.
As someone who villifies Obama regularly, I owe it to the man when he comes through. This time he did.

                More bad news about John McCain&amp;rsquo;s selection for Vice President emerged tonight. Sarah Palin was cited for fishing without a license.
CNN is sending a team of reporters and producers to Wasilla, Alaska, to cover this emerging scandal.
The citation does not indicate what she was fishing with or for, but the fact that a would-be Vice President of the United States did, with malice aforethought, cast her line into known fishing waters with the intent of extracting&amp;ndash;or reasonably expecting to extract&amp;ndash;a live fish demonstrates her unfitness for office of any kind.

They also spent 10 minutes spinning innuendo over the troopergate fabrication. CNN&amp;rsquo;s justification is that Palin hired a lawyer to handle the investigation. Duh! What was she supposed to do, hire a veterinarian? Her political enemies, of which she has many due to her cleaning-up of the GOP in Alaska, have seized upon a family dispute between Palin&amp;rsquo;s sister and brother-in-law, a State Trooper in Alaska.

Last year, Reid declared the war in Iraq lost, even as the troop surge began to show impressive signs toward ultimate victory. Today, he made his statement shortly after winds died down in New Orleans, and after the Army Corps of Engineers reported that the levees appeared to hold.

Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s eldest daughter, Bristol, is pregnant and will marry Levi, the child&amp;rsquo;s father, Todd and Sarah said today in a press release [FoxNews.com].
 The 17-year-old unwed daughter of John McCain’s new running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, is five-months pregnant, Palin and her husband, Todd Palin, said Monday in a written statement.
 McCain’s campaign told FOX News that the presumptive Republican presidential candidate knew about Bristol Palin’s pregnancy before he chose Palin as his running mate last Friday, and that Bristol is planning to marry the father of her child.

The Army Corps of Engineers&amp;rsquo; latest release said that levees were overtopped, relieving some pressure, but all levees were holding. It&amp;rsquo;s possible that the CNN&amp;rsquo;s reporters doesn&amp;rsquo;t know the definition of a breech.

                Every mention of Sarah Palin produced a banner-waving roar from the crowd of over 20,000 in T. R. Hughes Stadium in O&amp;rsquo;Fallon, Missouri, on blistering hot Sunday afternoon. While McCain is on top of the ticket, Palin is the draw.
A woman from Dent County&amp;ndash;about 3 hours from O&amp;rsquo;Fallon&amp;ndash;made the drive to see McCain and Palin in person. She was thrilled to get hold of a &amp;ldquo;McCain-Palin&amp;rdquo; banner after several stacks of the banners didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to her.

That ended with the announcement of Palin as is VP choice.
In St. Louis, tickets disappeared so quickly (and the distribution method was so lame-brained) that even donors and party activists with guaranteed reservations lost their reservations. The party decided to give away reserved tickets to meet the clamorous demand at the doors of various ticket locations (which is going to royally piss off my son Patrick when he finds out they gave away our tickets).

                It&amp;rsquo;s surprising, really, that Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s entire speech is an attack on John McCain filled with lies, deceits, and fake &amp;ldquo;facts.&amp;rdquo;
His self-aggrandizement borders on pathological. He alone will defend Israel. He alone will stop 4 billion years of climate change. He alone will provide health insurance to every man, woman, and child. The economy never had a negative growth quarter, but he sees a recession. Perhaps that recession comes from the emptiness of rhetoric.

Obama laundered money through a non-profit education foundation into Ayers&amp;rsquo; numerous corrupt organizations during the 1990s. When news broke of Obama&amp;rsquo;s connection to the convicted terrorist, Obama responded by attempting to incarcerate anyone investigating the connection.

Here&amp;rsquo;s what we know about Obama vis-a-vis the job of Commander in Chief: * No military experience * No business experience * Best friends are terrorists and racists * Believes in socialism over capitalism * Meglomaniacal fascination with himself * Wife hates America, except when America gives her cash * Funnels money to radicals in exchange for political favors * Made over $4 million last year and claims to hate the rich * Want&amp;rsquo;s to double the average American family&amp;rsquo;s tax burden * Hires mafia thugs to intimidate Republican rivals * Smokes and tells us not to * He&amp;rsquo;s not particularly smart, but he pretends to be in speeches * Lies about his political past, his personal past, his intentions * Lacks the spine to stand up for what he actually believes in So what&amp;rsquo;s that one word?

Hillary Clinton lacked them all.

The McCain campaign&amp;rsquo;s marketing brilliance continues to amaze. I had no idea he would be this adept at modern campaigning. With this ad, McCain will foment the still-simmering anger among Clinton&amp;rsquo;s most loyal supporters, as demonstrated in this Washington Times article.

Wow. Smart, smart man. Only . . . most colleges don&amp;rsquo;t have an IQ requirement. George W. Bush has degrees from Yale and Harvard, but his IQ is, like, 28 according to Biden. I guess whatever schools Biden went to, they give diplomas based on IQ instead of credit hours.

                The best thing about being a liberal is the license to write idiotic things, pretend they&amp;rsquo;re scientific, and receive praise from you fellow liberals who accept your nonsense as settled science.
Examples abound; just look at the mindless babblings of James Hansen and Al Gore. One a scientist, one a mediocre reporter.
Edward McClelland writing on Salon.com recently wasted a couple of hours on an essay the claims air conditioning causes people to vote Republican.

                Daily Kos won&amp;rsquo;t be too happy with the Biden choice.
ABC News&amp;rsquo;s Jake Tapper spent his Saturday morning documenting some of Joe Biden&amp;rsquo;s dumbest moments. (It&amp;rsquo;s long.) My favorite came from a Biden 1988 campaign ad in which he seemed to anticipate Obama&amp;rsquo;s candidacy:
 &amp;ldquo;The White House isn&amp;rsquo;t the place to learn how to deal with international crisis, the balance of power, war and peace, and the economic future of the next generation,&amp;rdquo; said a TV ad for Sen.

Because Biden was the party&amp;rsquo;s choice, not Obama&amp;rsquo;s.
Obama wanted a young candidate, a liberal, who would make Obama look stronger, older, weightier.

                I don&amp;rsquo;t know how meaningful this FoxNews poll is, really. But it is revealing about America&amp;rsquo;s confidence in the relative judgment of McCain and Obama.
American&amp;rsquo;s trust McCain more than 3 to 1 over Obama.
That&amp;rsquo;s big.
 If you had to make the “toughest decision” of your life, who would you rather get advice from — Obama or McCain?
 Based on that question, there are signs that undecided voters may be more inclined to move to McCain than to Obama.

Everybody’s watching what’s going on in Beijing right now with the Olympics. Think about the amount of money that China has spent on infrastructure. Their ports, their train systems, their airports are vastly the superior to us now, which means if you are a corporation deciding where to do business you’re starting to think, “Beijing looks like a pretty good option.

                Do you remember the summer of 2007? Reporters found John McCain carrying his own baggage through an airport and looking defeated and dissheveled. In debt, at the bottom of the polls, and old, the MSM declared his campaign over.
They were wrong. So was I.
Somehow, McCain staged a masterful comeback, and I use the word &amp;ldquo;masterful&amp;rdquo; advisedly. His comeback was not spectacular or flamboyant or even memorable. It was quiet, consistent, and strong.

                Rush Limbaugh came close, today, to a telling insight into the left&amp;rsquo;s love of Obama. He finished short. Let me complete Rush&amp;rsquo;s thought: The left worship Obama hoping for absolution and salvation.
Absolution is a big thing to a Catholic. It&amp;rsquo;s the difference between Heaven and Hell. Absolution comes only from God through His son Jesus Christ&amp;rsquo;s death and resurrection. The Messiah paved the way.
The left&amp;rsquo;s deification of Obama stands on its own.

 Russia pledged Sunday to begin removing its troops from Georgia on Monday, but the streets of this occupied city reflected a broadening, not a waning, of Russia&amp;rsquo;s military incursion.
 . . .
During a reporter&amp;rsquo;s 24-hour stay in the city this weekend, Russian soldiers roamed the streets in armored personnel carriers and waved Kalashnikov rifles to prevent entry to a captured Georgian military base that is now the Russian headquarters.

John McCain, who warned us a long time ago that President Bush&amp;rsquo;s evaluation of Putin was naive, called the matter right from the start, according Jim Wooten in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. McCain, who once said that he looked into Putin&amp;rsquo;s eyes and saw &amp;ldquo;a &amp;lsquo;K&amp;rsquo;, a &amp;lsquo;G&amp;rsquo;, and a &amp;lsquo;B&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rdquo; held one, single, defining position throughout the crisis:

 Last night the Obama was asked when an unborn child got legal rights. Like the spineless political tool he is he refused to answer stating that it was above his pay grade. The reason his answer matters is that he supports abortion on demand even when a child accidentally survives and lives outside the womb.

                Everytime I&amp;rsquo;ve debated the death penalty with a bleeding-heart, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this question: &amp;ldquo;Would you pull the switch&amp;rdquo; or its equal. It&amp;rsquo;s only fair to turn the question on them.
Barack Obama, if you read this blog, please answer this question: Would you kill child who survived an abortion with your own hands? (Thanks to Jill Stanek via Michelle Malkin)
 Barack Obama, as chairman of an IL state Senate committee, voted down a bill to protect live-born survivors of abortion - even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language, copied from a federal bill passed by Congress without objection in 2002, explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion.

                Steve McIntyre tears to shreds an anti-speech ruling by the British equivalent of the FCC, Ofcom. Ofcom ruled that a documentary &amp;ldquo;The Great Global Warming Swindle&amp;rdquo; violated rules, essentially, because the producers presented evidence contrary to the party line of the United Nations and the Labor government. In other words, in the UK, thou shalt not question global warming.

                While my flaming headline (&amp;quot;Dr. James Hansen of GISS is a Liar and Fraud&amp;quot;) received a fair amount of attention, people a lot smarter than I are carefully documenting the facts that led to my unavoidable conclusion.
One such appears on the Telegraph today. Christopher Booker (corrected link) notes that Dr. Hansen&amp;rsquo;s GISS center is alone in seeing continued warming throughout the world. Pointing out that laws supported by Hansen, Al Gore, and others will cost tens of trillions of dollars and severely limit freedoms throughout the world for the generations, Booker rightly contends that those proposing such a retreat from liberty be damn well sure they&amp;rsquo;re right.

                Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s most conspicuous quality, if you want to call it that, is shameless arrogance. His trip abroad was like Hitler&amp;rsquo;s tour of Italy in 1938. Before you dismiss my view as that of a party hack tearing down the opposition, read Susan Estrich&amp;rsquo;s column on FoxNews.com. (Estrich was Michael Dukakis&amp;rsquo;s campaign manager in 1988).
First, Presidential candidates rarely campaign in war zones, and for good reason. American politics traditionally sort of stopped &amp;ldquo;at the water&amp;rsquo;s edge,&amp;rdquo; as the saying went.

                Rasmussen&amp;rsquo;s presidential tracking poll shows a dead heat between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican Presidential Candidate John McCain (h/t Drudge). This poll confirms the Newsweek poll showing the two in a statistical dead heat.
Moreover, according Rasmussen, McCain enjoys higher favorability ratings than Obama.
Considering that McCain has received little media attention since the last Democrat primary in June, Obama&amp;rsquo;s 15 percentage point drop can only be blamed on Obama&amp;rsquo;s dismal performance as a candidate.

                Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s poll lead over John McCain has plummeted from 51-35 to a statistical dead-heat in less than a month.
Obama&amp;rsquo;s downward spiral has Newsweek&amp;rsquo;s headline writers asking if his glow is fading. The polls finds that more than half of voters consider Obama lying opportunist who will take any position for votes.
 Obama&amp;rsquo;s rapid drop comes at a strategically challenging moment for the Democratic candidate. Having vanquished Hillary Clinton in early June, Obama quickly went about repositioning himself for a general-election audience&amp;ndash;an unpleasant task for any nominee emerging from the pander-heavy primary contests and particularly for a candidate who&amp;rsquo;d slogged through a vigorous primary challenge in most every contest from January until June.

On the other hand, Arctic sea ice had a bad week. Mounting evidence points to underwater volcanoes pumping superheated water toward the bottom of the ice as the major problem, but the hysteriacs will blame my cigarette smoke.

                Despite all scientific evidence now denying the greenhouse hypothesis, the greenhousers stand by their story. That story: global temperatures will continue to rise in direct proportion to the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere and for many years after CO2 emissions stop altogether resulting mass famine, flooding, death, and the Cubs winning the World Series.
Unfortunately for Al Gore, the past year saw almost every tenet, speculation, and idea about greenhouse gasses and man-made global warming fall to the scrutiny of science: * The Tree Ring theory upon which Mann relied was proven wrong, as tree leaves maintain a constant internal temperature of 21.

                The Associated Press, long upset that people often quote and link to its stories on the internet, has imposed a $2.50 per word fee for bloggers who wish to quote one of its stories.
I understand. It&amp;rsquo;s tough to have a lot of people driving web traffic to your site. Considering the number of articles attributed to the AP, the cost of servers and bandwidth must be outrageous.
But I have a solution: Stop posting stories on the internet.

                I just listened to a replay of today&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Meet the Press&amp;rdquo; on the radio, at least the roundtable. All talk was about the Democrat race: blacks have come far; Clintons have fallen farther. It struck me that the pundits&amp;ndash;liberal Democrats all&amp;ndash;seemed to have forgotten that another vote happens in November. Instead of deep analysis of the McCain-Obama face-off, Andrea Mitchell and Tim Russert were handicapping Obama&amp;rsquo;s cabinet picks.

The sun is the source and cause of all weather. The aggregate of weather is climate. When the sun changes, climate changes.
These are irrefutable truths of science, even though Dr. Mann, Al Gore, and the global warming hysteriacs skipped that chapter in their science books.
Part II
The downside of global cooling, or ice ages, is far worse for humanity and most species of fish, plants, and animals than the worst predictions of global warming.

I&amp;rsquo;m a hyperbolist, myself, so I tend to see this as sophomoric anti-abortion speech. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s exploitive: it exploits those who treat infanticide as a coin-flip decision. It exploits the moronic pro-abortion arguments the dehumanize unborn children.

Since the Rev. Jeremiah Wright controversy reached the tipping point with The O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Factor on Thursday a week ago, Obama has pointed many fingers and blamed many people, including his &amp;ldquo;typical white person&amp;rdquo; grandmother.

One example of the phenomenon comes from the cult of Global Warming.
The brilliant Anthony Watts has uncovered some old newspapers from 1922 and 1933 that prove my point very well. From the Washington Post of November 2, 1922, we learn that the death of the Arctic ice cap was nigh:
 The Arctic ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot, according to a report to the Commerce Department yesterday from Consul Ifft, at Bergen, Norway.

Obama&amp;rsquo;s only defense in the Rev. Jeremiah Wright scandal was to claim he never heard vitriol spew from Wright&amp;rsquo;s mouth. Many pundits, including Obama supporters, warned that any evidence putting Obama in that church during an ant-US, anti-white hate sermon would be Obama&amp;rsquo;s undoing. He&amp;rsquo;d be a proven petty liar.
Looks like he is:
  Wright laced into America&amp;rsquo;s establishment, blaming the &amp;ldquo;white arrogance&amp;rdquo; of America&amp;rsquo;s Caucasian majority for the woes of the world, especially the oppression suffered by blacks.

Others are subtler in their descriptions, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see any other way of stating the case. Yesterday, Barack Obama admitted to the Chicago Tribune that his campaigns have ac
cepted twice as much money from Tony Rezko than the candidate admitted in the past.
Obama, the candidate of judgment, blames repeated lapses of judgment. (Perhaps his judgment is impaired only when someone has a large amount of cash.

                In a pathetic admission of his own shallowness, Barack Obama admitted that he&amp;rsquo;s known since his campaign began that the Rev. Jeremiah Wright is an anti-US racist. According to Fox News:
 Obama said he never personally heard Wright preach the statements at the center of the controversy, but he first learned of them when he launched his presidential campaign.
 For almost a year, Obama has defended the bigot, naming him chairman of the African-American Spirtitual Leadership Committee for his campaign.

 Ugly stuff. But this is also the proudly and openly expressed opinion of every major and minor contributor to The Nation magazine, lots of folks at The New Republic, the loudest members of the anti-war faction, and if my memory for op-eds since the mid-1980s is right, apparently a majority of vocal members of the Democratic Party.

Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s wife is unabashedly anti-American. His spiritual advisor is more so. That advisor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, hates white people, too. When the person with whom you choose to live your life and the person from whom you seek guidance for your thoughts and actions are known anti-American bigots, people are justified in assuming you are like them.

Something happened on the way to the coronation: the truth hit Barack Obama square in the face.
Noam Scheiber of The New Republic previously dismissed the NAFTA-Canuk story, now admits the story has legs:
 Two things make it problematic for the Obama campaign: 1.) The sudden appearance of this lurid-sounding memo written by a Canadian consular official. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s particularly revealing&amp;ndash;as I said this morning, it reflects what the Canadians thought they heard from Goolsbee; there are, significantly, no direct quotes.

                The Catholic Church is often wrongly accused of suppressing science throughout the so-called Dark Ages. Legend has it that the Church used her secular influence over divine-right monarchs to thwart scientific inquiry.
It&amp;rsquo;s all hooey, of course. During the Medieval period, the lack of an economic system that generated surplus left the Church alone to advance science, translate texts, and preserve history.
But that&amp;rsquo;s a different story.

Not that I&amp;rsquo;d missed the trend to move from solo blogging to group blogging, then to extremely commercial blogging, but Ed&amp;rsquo;s voluntary consolidation saddened me. Not that it should.
Consolidation seems a natural tendency among human beings and their institutions. Remember the CLECs? (Competitive Local Exchange Carriers were the new phone companies like Allegiance, Onvoy, Big, McCloud.

                Pay attention to this little news bit: Chavez sends troops to Colombian border.
Chavez is a Stalinist, and Stalin founded and expanded the Soviet Union with a combination of force, threats, and promises. Every Soviet student expects Chavez to follow suit.
 President Hugo Chavez on Sunday ordered 10 battalions of troops to the border with Colombia after Colombia&amp;rsquo;s military killed a top rebel leader.
He called the U.S.-allied government in Bogota &amp;ldquo;a terrorist state&amp;rdquo; and labeled President Alvaro Uribe &amp;ldquo;a criminal.

This is serious stuff, Terence.
Thanks to Ed Morrissey, we have some details about Obama&amp;rsquo;s open admission to telling his supporters lies in order garner their support.
 On Wednesday, CTV reported that a senior member of Obama&amp;rsquo;s campaign called the Canadian government within the last month &amp;ndash; saying that when Senator Obama talks about opting out of the free trade deal, the Canadian government shouldn&amp;rsquo;t worry.

David Brooks&amp;rsquo; masterful obituary of William F. Buckley in the New York Times gives that paper a reprieve, however short, from the right&amp;rsquo;s vituperations.
 National Review&amp;rsquo;s readers no doubt shared a hatred for Communism, but many of them simply wanted to be like Buckley.
 Guilty as charged. And proud of my crime.

                Demonstrating a remarkable daftness for thinking on his feet, Barack Obama magnified the folly of a debate gaffe, today, in a clumsy rejoinder to John McCain&amp;rsquo;s response.
In a debate, Obama said he would deploy troops back into Iraq, after a pullout, if al Qaeda established bases. (Do I really need to point out the lack of intelligence, understanding, and strategy his comment portrays?)
McCain responded by saying, &amp;ldquo;I have news for Senator Obama, al Qaeda is in Iraq, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re fighting in Iraq.

The right (myself included) knew damn well what the left media were up to: influence voters to pick the weakest, viable Republican candidate.
They&amp;rsquo;ve done it.
McCain was the &amp;ldquo;media darling&amp;rdquo; candidate only until all other candidates fell out. That fall out came with this week&amp;rsquo;s primaries. Today, the very media that built up McCain and propelled him to the Republican nomination tore him down.

                I am disheartened that James Joyner continues to find more fault with conservatives&amp;rsquo; reasons and methods for attacking a socialist than with the socialist himself.
In the growing debate over a Che Guevara Cuban flag proudly adorning the wall of Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s headquarters in Houston, Texas, Joyner comes galloping to Obama&amp;rsquo;s defense, ignoring the mounting evidence that Obama is as every bit as much a threat to capitalism as is Hugo Chavez.

                The New York Times on Tuesday will carry story describing the Hillary Clinton campaign as a death-watch (h/t Drudge).
It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that on January 7, I wrote the Kerry campaign obituary prematurely. Still, the problems Hillary faces are of the sort that spells doom to candidates, either in their nomination quest or, later, in the general election. Shuffling top staff, borrowing money from the candidate, asking staff to work without pay are all symptoms of a campaign in deep trouble.

Something close, in the strategic sense, happened recently in Iraq. US fighters seized the diary of an al Qaeda in Iraq leader. The journal provides our side with names of terrorists, descriptions of their tactics, evidence of their atrocities, and catalogs of their weapons.
Just as important, though, the book proves that we are winning and the terrorists are losing.

To paraphrase Harry Truman, if McCain (or Huckster) is the nominee, there won&amp;rsquo;t be a dime&amp;rsquo;s difference between the two parties. Given that, why not vote for the real deal in Hillary or Obama? McCain is an impostor. (Related: Michelle Malkin asks if the GOP is lost.)

                Back in the 1980s, it was fashionable for the left to scoff at Reagan&amp;rsquo;s economic notion that a rising tide lifts all ships. Liberal economists and politicians sneeringly referred to &amp;ldquo;trickle-down&amp;rdquo; economics as a justification for the rich to keep the poor poor. Every responsible economist knew Reagan was right, but the left in America had no accountability. Many Americans, by 1986, believed &amp;ldquo;trickle-down&amp;rdquo; economics pure evil.

                Sorry, folks. I&amp;rsquo;m paying attention to the world in between client meetings. I have my most significant client in town.
I am heartbroken that Fred Thompson ended his race. I am discouraged that he had to end it. The only Reagan conservative&amp;ndash;well, Reagan-style conservative&amp;ndash;in the race is gone. My best to Fred and his family.
That leaves us with McCain (moderate) and Romney (smarmy).
And Obama (Jimmy Carter).
I&amp;rsquo;ll blog more tomorrow, but Carter&amp;rsquo;s presidency gave us Reagan.

                America, and the world, could be looking at the worst recession since the &amp;rsquo;70s and early &amp;rsquo;80s. (Coincidentally, the last recession began simultaneously with the end of an 8 year presidency. The one before that was pretty close, too.) I remember that era.
Only the unions and the remnants of employer-worker loyalty saved my neighbors from prolonged unemployment and foreclosure. St. Louis firms tried hard to keep their doors open. We know it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so good in other industrial cities: Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Milwaukee, southern Pennsylvania.

                With his third place finish in South Carolina, a lot of us are just waiting for the announcement from Fred Thompson that the race, for him, is over.
Charles Bird blogs on RedState that Thompson should do the honorable thing by dropping out and endorsing McCain. McCain, in turn, would return the favor naming Thompson his running mate if nominated.
 Thompson has enough support from social and economic conservatives to bring us a solid base going forward, especially if Thompson is a presumptive running mate.

                The polls in South Carolina closed 52 minutes ago, and ABC News projects that John McCain and Mike Huckebee will finish first and second (or second and first) with Fred Thompson battling Mitt Romney for third.
A third place finish could spell the end for Thompson and hopes for a conservative Republican candidate in 2008. A win for McCain could put the Arizona Senator and former POW on a wave that would carry him to the nomination&amp;ndash;and a brutal defeat in November.

Here&amp;rsquo;s the latest from RealClearPolitics. The spreads and the leaders are so out of whack, so changing, that no one can draw any intelligent conclusions.
While McCain&amp;rsquo;s number is static at about 26, Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s numbers fluctuate wildly. Romney and Paul are steadily falling, while our hero Thompson rises steadily.

Levant was ordered against his will to appear before the Commission on Friday, January 10. He began with a compelleing opening statement that made the Commission sound like a collection of Nazi boobs hellbent on destroying the right of political speech and to advance the cause of radical Islam in Canada.

                UPDATE 1/12/08*
This story is now both depressing and disgusting and disturbing. According to FoxNews, Laurean, the Marine accused of raping Maria Lauterbach, violently killed her and burned her body in his back yard. He crafted a noted claiming Laurean had slit her own throat&amp;ndash;a scenario quickly dismissed by crime scene investigators.

                I could not watch the South Carolin GOP debate tonight, but I am ecstatic. Ron Paul made an ass of himself, but Michelle Malkin who, like me, seems to fret over Fred&amp;rsquo;s performances sometimes, has no doubt Fred won.
From the clip I blogged below, I have to give points to Romney for slamming Ron Paul. As a war hero, John McCain had every right to across the stage and belt that phony, lying, racist scum.

                Mitt Romney is pulling his broadcast advertising from South Carolina and Florida (h/t Drudge).
This could help Fred&amp;rsquo;s Fort Sumter strategy. I might have been wrong about Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s descent, as he seems to remain above 20 percent in key states. By conceding South Carolina, though, Romney may end up driving soft supporters to Thompson, and that might be his strategy.
With McCain, the media darling, rising, Romney could hope to bump up Thompson&amp;rsquo;s numbers in the Palmetto State.

To be fair, Jimmy Carter inherited a country that needed a lot of work.
Lyndon Johnson&amp;rsquo;s Great Society programs, built on Roosevelt&amp;rsquo;s economically untenable New Deal welfare state, had set the nation&amp;rsquo;s economy and social classes on a path to destruction a decade earlier. The self-absorption of the Baby Boomers decayed the social institutions and mores that sustained us for 200 years.

 * Thompson understands the philosophical foundations on which this country was born and became the greatest nation on earth * Thompson&#39;s sense of humor is sharp, ready, and appropriate * Thompson&#39;s legal training and experience shines when it comes to framing the issue, such as &amp;quot;why not Barack Obama?

The latest evidence comes brilliantly from Jeff Jacoby via Boston Globe. Some of the facts:
 * Temperatures have been flat since 2000, even though CO2 in the atmosphere increased 4 percent * 2007, predicted by all alarmist models to be the hottest in recent history, was not * The second half of 2007 was one of the coldest in recent times * Ice in Antarctica is growing rapidly for the first time in 6,000 years * Al Gore is an idiot  There.

Addision is a bit skeptical of Novak&amp;rsquo;s conclusions, noting that Bob did not name a source. I suspected Huckabee&amp;rsquo;s campaign as the source, but Romney is also a possibility.

The Good
Thompson, McCain, and Giuliani helped themselves in varying degrees. Captain Ed Morrissey seems to agree:
 Fred Thompson got Romney to admit he liked the &amp;ldquo;mandates that you want&amp;rdquo;. It seemed to me that Thompson and McCain won the foreign policy portion of the debate. Everyone got a chance to score a few points off of Ron Paul, who trotted out the same tired &amp;ldquo;terrorism is our fault&amp;rdquo; theme that he just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to surrender.

Nonetheless, if Thompson could pick up 3 of the remaining 4, it would be a banner day for the true conservative voice.

 Don&amp;rsquo;t these yahoo&amp;rsquo;s understand that everything is taped nowadays? That bloggers will be on you quickly if you misrepresent an event? But they do it anyway.
 Incredible.

 I’ve seldom seen anything as obviously slanted as that [Politico story] . I’m not sure what problem the Politico has with the former Senator, but it’s clear that the guys there want to make him look as bad as possible.

                Fred Thompson, who only a week ago was predicted to finish behind Ron Paul, roared into third place in the Iowa Caucuses, passing McCain and Giuliani. Huckabee and Romney finished one and two.
Because so many had written off Thompson, his third-place showing should bolster his campaign&amp;ndash;a campaign that seemed stuck in low gear until recently.
The sad news is the support for Huckabee, a &amp;ldquo;non-conservative&amp;rdquo; Baptist minister who played a populism card in Iowa, demagoguing the Christian Right to build big momentum headed into the caucuses.

                Iran commissioned a stealth attack submarine on November 28, adding a dangerous and potentially destabilizing weapon to its aggressive arsenal. Built with Russian help, the Ghadir is capable of launching torpedoes and missiles simultaneously.
Perhaps Iran has suspended its nuke program. Perhaps not. An advanced sub patrolling the Med in the hands of Iranian nuts is bad news for that part of the world.
Makes me wish I was still in our submarine force.

                Just as Fred Thompson&amp;rsquo;s campaign started to take off, a loose conspiracy of MSM and bloggers seems determined to bring him down.
As I blogged last night, a single rumor on Control Congress, which seemed implausible, turned into a major story today&amp;ndash;the day of the Iowa Cauci.
Apparently, the anti-Thompson forces were spooked by his surge in the polls in Iowa and decided to employ one of the dirtiest tricks in politics: the withdrawal rumor.

                Control Congress carried a rumor, today, that appears to have no legs.
 I was watching the Morning Joe and they claim the rumor is out that if Thompson does badly in Iowa he may pull out and endorse McCain.
 Whether or not McCain or Thompson might, at campaign&amp;rsquo;s end, recommend their supporters to one or the other remains a possibility. But I seriously doubt this rumor came from inside Thompson&amp;rsquo;s campaign.

                There are reasons to believe that Fred Thompson&amp;rsquo;s campaign is surging in Iowa.
First, Zogby&amp;lsquo;s daily tracking poll finds Thompson in a tie for 3rd with McCain.
Second, a Des Moines Register poll concluded 12/30 saw Thompson&amp;rsquo;s numbers rise by 2 percentage points.
Third, strategic Vision, concluded 12/30, shows an up-tic for Thompson.
Fourth, pundits are taking notice of both the late surge and Thompson&amp;rsquo;s penchant for substance over glitz:

According to the Illinois Supreme Court web site, Jay R. Grodner, the scumbag who keyed a deploying Marine&amp;rsquo;s car, committed vote fraud resulting in the suspension of his law license in 1984:
Here&amp;rsquo;s highlights from the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s findings:
 The Administrator charged Petersen with forging voter signatures and with actively recruiting Grodner, Presbrey, Weir, and Truemper to assist in this effort.

                Liberalism is cultural treason.
Past US wars have spawned heroes. Generations honored them. I came of age in the 1980s, but I was well aware of men like Audey Murphy, Ted Knight, Doolittle, Patton, the men of Iwo Jima, the Baton Death March. These great men shaped our understanding of what it means to be a man.
Liberalism, though, has robbed my sons of such heroes. At least, it&amp;rsquo;s made their task of learning about these heroes much more difficult.

 A senior aide to Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee admitted Friday that the former Arkansas governor had &amp;ldquo;no foreign policy credentials&amp;rdquo; after his comments reacting to the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto raised questions.
 When a candidate&amp;rsquo;s senior aide admits the candidate knows nothing about the world beyond Arkansas, USA, the voters must take the aide seriously. A vote for Huckabee might be more un-American than a vote for a Democrat.

Hillary Clinton, whose troubles with questions from the people are the stuff of political legend, is employing the reverse of this lawyer&amp;rsquo;s rule: don&amp;rsquo;t take questions if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a good answer.
As Riehl World View explains that Hillary&amp;rsquo;s take NO questions in an attempt to avoid further gaffes, like not knowing how many children her close, personal friend Benazir Bhutto had.

Obama
Barrack Obama&amp;rsquo;s team blamed the United States, George Bush, and everyone who supported the Iraq War for Bhutto&amp;rsquo;s assassination. In other words, like the child he is, Obama blamed everyone but himself.
Clinton
Our friend Gateway Pundit points out that Hillary&amp;rsquo;s soliloquy on Bhutto centered on the Senators long, close, personal relationship with Bhutto that lasted a dozen years.

The blog burst has put Fred back on the air in Iowa. From our friend, Sean Hackbarth, at Fred &amp;lsquo;08:
  Your efforts are working. “Substance” is now airing in Iowa. We’re only $87,398 away from making sure it stays running through the caucuses. If 2200 people give $40 we make our goal. That’s doable since our average contribution today has been over $70.This wide-open Republican race means anything can happen.

                Mark Steyn might have said it best
Benazir Bhutto&amp;rsquo;s return to Pakistan had a mad recklessness about it which give today&amp;rsquo;s events a horrible inevitability.
Were any of us surprised to hear the news today? An Islamofascist slug shot to death Benazir Bhutto then blew up, either of his own volition or remotely by his sponsors. (We&amp;rsquo;ve learned to not believe that all terrorism executors are volunteers.)
Pakistan is home to Usama bin Laden, al Qaeda&amp;rsquo;s central command, and the what remains of the Taliban.

Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s too strong, but it&amp;rsquo;s true. Anyone who votes for a candidate because of his or her statements on current issues is a moron too intellectually lazy to consider the gravity of a vote for president. Moreover, &amp;ldquo;issues voters&amp;rdquo; are gullible and selfish egomaniacs too caught up in their own immediate wants to recognize a liar when he&amp;rsquo;s selling them snake oil.

                When Drudge devotes his middle column to the collapse of Congress under Democrat control, you know the Dems are in trouble.
Citing four hit pieces in major papers, including The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post (here and here), USA Today, and The Hill, the DrudgeReport does to Pelosi and Reid what no amount of Republican advertising could ever do; he proves that Democrats are unfit to run the government.

Conservatives, like Rush Limbaugh and Michelle Malkin, are doing back-bends to convince us that Iran is still a nuclear threat. Fine. I won&amp;rsquo;t argue that point. But a much larger story here looms, and everyone is missing it.
Iran&amp;rsquo;s reported abandonment of it nuclear weapons drive coincides with the United States&amp;rsquo; invasion of Iraq!

That candidate is Fred Thompson, who leads the GOP in publishing specific ideas. Perhaps the reason other candidates don&amp;rsquo;t put their ideas onto paper is that they don&amp;rsquo;t have any. Or they know that conservatives won&amp;rsquo;t like them.

                The next election loomed ominously upon the political horizon in November 1979. A decade of failed foreign policy, Soviet expansion, stagflation, gas and oil shortages, historically severe winters, soaring crime rates, marauding youth, sexual perversion, and unstable standards left the American people wondering, &amp;ldquo;What next?&amp;rdquo;
Next, of course, was the Iranian hostage crisis, which might well be called &amp;ldquo;the last straw.&amp;rdquo; Jimmy Carter and his Democrat party took the blame. The once proud term &amp;ldquo;liberalism&amp;rdquo; became profane.

If he attends University of Delaware, the answer is &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo;
Thanks to Joanne Jacobs on Pajama&amp;rsquo;s Media (h/t The Discerning Texan), we learn that Delaware is holding liberal, Soviet-style thought control experiments on its students, for which its faculty and administration should be taken out and shot.

                Northern Pakistan&amp;ndash;al Qaeda Entertainment, a division of al Qaeda-at-large, announced today that the next Osama bin Laden video will feature American pop star Britney Spears.
al Qaeda hopes that Spears&amp;rsquo; presence will help increase viewership in the 15-24 demographic, a prime target for terrorist recruitment. Melinda Roikers, Ms. Spears&amp;rsquo; publicist, said the OBL video could mitigate some of the damage to Britney&amp;rsquo;s career and reputation as a result of her public drunkeness, her radical haircut, her feud with her mother, and her recent appearance on the Video Music Awards.

                Washington &amp;ndash; Massechusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, today, challenged General David Petraeus, commander of forces in Iraq, to a fist fight in the rotunda of the Capitol over their disagreements on the effectiveness of surge.
&amp;ldquo;If General &amp;lsquo;Betray Us&amp;rsquo; were half the man he acts like in front of the cameras, he&amp;rsquo;d come out here and fight like one,&amp;rdquo; shouted an angry and apparently intoxicated Kennedy during an impromptu press conference near the Declaration of Independence display.

The hours that we work are a bit off-putting, though.
 The U.S. employee put in an average 1,804 hours of work in 2006, the report said. That compared with 1,407.

Last week, as good new about the surge was cresting, the AP treated as fact an opinion piece that the &amp;ldquo;body count&amp;rdquo; in Iraq had doubled since the surge began.
Today, AP customers are leading with another AP opinion piece claiming that August was one of the bloodiest months since the Iraq war began.

 How have things changed in Iraq? Petraeus compared the previous condition of Ramadi to Stalingrad. The general told the newspaper that having to stay on defense had taken its toll on American strength and had emboldened the enemy.

Following the phony story that Gen. Pace would urge the President to cut troops in Iraq by half, the Red Crescent, today, released a report that a record number of Iraqis have fled their homes in fear of their lives since the surge began.

Today, though, I received their quarterly newsletter. I was a bit surprised by the number of stories about &amp;ldquo;blacks.&amp;rdquo; As I continued to read, it was obvious that the editors of the paper hold racial views that I have no desire to be associated with.

                It started in July with polls showing Americans were increasingly supportive of the war in Iraq. Then, the President&amp;rsquo;s approval rating began to climb. Then Congress&amp;rsquo;s approval rating fell to an all-time low. In between, the odd Democrat Congressman or analyst returned from Iraq saying good things, not bad, about the effect of the troop surge.
With thanks to the California Conservative and Captain Ed for finding this story, we find that the Washington Post is reporting that the Democrats are forced to shift their policy on Iraq because of the undeniable success of the surge.

Environmentalist Bette Midler (who, I think, is related to Barbara Streisand) faces state charges in Hawaii for illegally killing more than 200 trees on her estate.  The staff of the Board of Land and Natural Resources recommended $6,500 in fines for having the trees felled and for building a graded road without permits required for the land zoned for conservation use.
 Of course, she had the trees clear-cut in order to improve the environment, or so her publicist claims.

                A Democrat apparatchik named Lane Hudson has filed a complaint against Fred Thompson with the Federal Election Commission, according to WaPo.
The lefty claims that Thompson is violating the law by operating like a candidate without declaring his candidacy. Hudson plans to file similar complaints against George Washington, who spent much of the Revolutionary War traveling through critical electoral states, like Pennsylvannia and New York, without declaring himself a candidate for President.

                I stand for total victory in Iraq.
Background Some say that I blindly support President Bush and everything he does. I do not. Nor do I publicly lambaste his missteps the way others, like Peggy Noonan, do. This blog, I hope, will explain to my readers and friends how I can hold several seemingly incongruous positions on Bush and the War.
 * The United States, the free world, in fact, was justified in invading Iraq and overthrowing Saddam * The war in Iraq was not successful in its early days despite the perception of a rout * The administration&#39;s greatest failure was kowtowing to the left * The symptom of that kowtowing was establishing a defensive posture instead of continuing the attack * Donald Rumsfeld failed the President by refusing to return to an offensive strategy * The key to victory is ruthless aggression * Republicans should limit criticism of Bush to recommendations that will achieve victory  Justification Following 9/11, President Bush told Peggy Noonan in a private meeting that every night he goes to bed expecting to be woken and told that Saddam has unleashed a WMD in America.

My question is, Why aren&amp;rsquo;t we killing them? The Kurds are, according this story at Gateway Pundit.
They are enemy combatants in an American occupation zone. We need answer to no one for eliminating this problem.

Officer Norvelle Brown, only 22 years old and a rookie cop, made St. Louis headlines for the second time in his short career&amp;ndash;his short, honorable life. In April, Officer Brown responded to a hostage situation during a barber shop robber, defusing the situation and apprehending the armed robbers.

Why: Interest in Thompson as the non-candidate peaked in late June and the first week of July.

Cities, it seems, make storms worse. Tall buildings direct wind upward, intensifying the storms. City heat islands, like warm ocean water to a hurricane, fuel storms.

                I know this site has changed a lot, but there&amp;rsquo;s a reason.
I was sick of the traditional blog format, so I switched to magazine layout. Unfortunately, the theme I used has incompatible with some plug-ins and javascript links I really need. So I customized the HemingwayEx theme.
I love this theme (sorry if you don&amp;rsquo;t) and plan to keep it for a while.
Please scroll down to take my poll on the new theme.

                The three Marines who were charged and cleared of murdering civilians in Iraq became the poster children for Jack Murtha&amp;rsquo;s attempts to destroy the U.S. Marine Corps. (I have no doubt that Murtha drank of Ho Chi Minh&amp;rsquo;s kool-aid in Viet Nam.) Murtha&amp;rsquo;s lies, smears, libels, and slanders launched an anti-American industry that just held its Yearly Kos nightmare in Chicago.
The Marines libeled by Murtha and others are free, now.

John Hawkins, in Right Wing News&amp;rsquo;s Q&amp;amp;A, responds to a question posed by RtWingNutCase, to wit: should the US pull out of Iraq prematurely, would the left turn its activism toward influencing a withdrawal from Afghanistan?
Hawkins correctly says, &amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; but he stops short of speculating on motives. I won&amp;rsquo;t.
The left&amp;rsquo;s motive in withdrawing from the world is to weaken America and the West.

Michelle Malkin does an outstanding job of breaking down the NASA Y2K error that sort of invented global warming.
In short, 1998 was NOT the hottest year of the 20th century. And half of the hottest years on record occured before WWII. Al Gore is an idiot, and now NASA scientists have proven it.
Earlier this week, the wackos got bad news from U of C San Diego and NASA who discovered that aerosols do not mask atmospheric warming but accelerate it.

Are they cooperating with the feds in a larger investigation? Or did the DNC or one of the Democrat campaigns ask the media to bury the story? Or do the MSM no longer consider terrorism in the United States newsworthy?

Whatever. Profile away.

                For years, global warming alarmists have claimed that aerosols have masked the effects of greenhouse gases in the past, explaining why global temperatures cooled during a period of rapid greenhouse gas production in the 20th century.
But a new study by University of California-San Diego and NASA (found on FoxNews.com) indicates that the alarmists were wrong about the aerosols: they don&amp;rsquo;t reduce temperature but raise it. In other words, the things that wackos claim to reduce global warming actually cause global warming.

Whether or not his fledgling campaign for President will so endure is another matter.
Rummaging through the odd blog with a Ron Paul theme, I found some common characteristics among his supporters:
 * Young * Typically apolitical * Technology careers * Homosexual * Educated * Atheist * Decent writing skills * No particular axe to grind  I know many who fit the type, particularly working in the software industry.

                Last night in the U.S. House of Representatives, a party&amp;rsquo;s leadership refused to abide by a legal vote (Volunteer Opinion Journal).
The vote was on a Republican measure to strip from a farm bill language that guaranteed welfare for illegal aliens. The vote was 215-213 in favor of stripping the guarantees.
But Nancy Pelosi wanted a different result. So, her minions essentially burned the ballots, declared there was no vote, and ordered a new one (Michelle Malkin).

                Democrat candidate for president Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s bizarre chess game with foreign policy took another twist today.
In remarks to a report, Obama seemed to formulate his nuclear policy as he went along:
 &amp;ldquo;I think it would be a profound mistake for us to use nuclear weapons in any circumstance,&amp;rdquo; Obama said, with a pause, &amp;ldquo;involving civilians.&amp;rdquo; Then he quickly added, &amp;ldquo;Let me scratch that. There&amp;rsquo;s been no discussion of nuclear weapons.

Two weeks ago, he told us that the United States is obliged to stay out of wars, even to prevent genocide. He would not have fought Germany in World War II unless Germany attacked the United States. He would not stop the genocide in Darfur or Congo. He would not have gone to Somalia or Bosnia.
That, again, was two weeks ago.

 In the race for the **Republican Presidential nomination, **former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson remains nominally on top with support from 26% of Likely Republican Primary voters. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani remains essentially even as the top choice for 24%. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and Arizona Senator John McCain are each preferred by 12% (see daily history).

                The UN Security Council, today, finally got around to approving a 26,000-strong force to control the violence in Darfur (FoxNews.com).
I have a depressing suspicion that this means there are no Christians left for the Muslims to kill in Darfur. Expat Yank thinks the same:
 There are only two reasons a predator state engaged in fomenting widespread slaughter (the UN has not termed Darfur “genocide”) will voluntarily allow in a UN peacekeeping force: 1) that state has already accomplished most of its ”slaughter” goals (remember, this conflict began in February 2003), or 2) it doesn’t believe the UN force will be able to accomplish much of anything anyway, so its best to let it be deployed in order to get the “international community” off its back.

Nonesense.
First, Fred formed the committee on June 4. It takes a while to get the money flow started, to get people going to the websites, etc. If the average daily gross for June 24 - June 30 were no greater than that of the first week, I&amp;rsquo;d be more concerned.

The surge is working according two liberals from the Brookings Institute writing in the New York Times. And according to Dean Barnett blogging on HughHewitt.townhall.com, their former friends on the left are ready to do to them what it appears Chuck Schumer did to the Chief Justice.

   The Prime Minister vowed to take Winston Churchill’s lead and make Britain’s ties with America even stronger.
  Mr Brown stunned critics by THANKING President Bush for the fight against Islamic extremism, and insisted the UK-US relationship will be his No1 foreign policy priority.

                Michelle Malkin responds to that unnecessary race of humans known as liberals. The liberals, it seems, have gone about calling her web site, michellemalkin.com, a &amp;ldquo;hate-site.&amp;rdquo;
Other bloggers are jumping in to defend Michelle. I won&amp;rsquo;t. I think she has one of the best blogs in the business, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t need my defense.
First, liberals are evil little creatures&amp;ndash;more little than evil, in the small, petty sense. Their self-righteous slander is not really meant to hurt its target as to aggrandize the speaker or writer in his own small mind and among his own petty peers.

                Boston.com reports that social conservatives are &amp;ldquo;coalescing&amp;rdquo; around Fred Thompson as their choice for Republican nominee for President in 2008.
 &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a consensus developing around him that&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear and pretty profound,&amp;rdquo; said John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, an Orlando-based conservative group. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anything like it in 25 years in politics.&amp;rdquo;
 I agree. In 1979, as a high school sophomore with a National Review subscription, I became dissatisfied (for a short time) with the GOP.

                St. Louis, MO &amp;ndash; The Washington Post is reporting that former U. S. Senator and presumed Republican candidate (nominee?) for President, Fred Thompson, may have practiced law during a period of his life when he was out of office, according to sources inside BlogsForFredThompson.com.
The speculation is based on discoveries of Fred Thompson&amp;rsquo;s signature and name on court briefs in various Washington, DC. One of the briefs&amp;ndash;a &amp;ldquo;friend of the court&amp;rdquo; brief&amp;ndash; from August 1981 argues that citizens cannot be arrested for activities that are not against the law.

Matt Margolis, who does great research, has the answer.
 The 2007 hurricane season may be less severe than forecast due to cooler-than-expected water temperatures in the tropical Atlantic, private forecaster WSI Corp said on Tuesday.
 Just not enough global warming. The Gores&amp;rsquo;ll have to kick out a lot more CO2 in 2008. See Matt&amp;rsquo;s piece for the whole story.

As an act of courtesy to the politics-weary American public, Fred Thompson is likely to announce his candidacy for the GOP nomination for President in September, according to columnist-reporterRobert Novak.
Thompson&amp;rsquo;s late entry may reverse a trend in recent years in which the next presidential campaign begins before the last one ends. If Thompson believes the people will be sick of Giuliani, Clinton, and Obama by the time the Super Bowl comes around, he may be right.

                Senator Clinton asked the Pentagon to describe its plans to withdraw from Iraq. The Pentagon—specifically, undersecretary of defense, Eric Edelman—replied in the most appropriate manner imaginable:
 Premature and public discussion of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq reinforces enemy propaganda that the United States will abandon its allies in Iraq, much as we are perceived to have done in Vietnam, Lebanon and Somalia
 In response, Ms. Clinton displayed the kind of hysterium one associates with under-medicated paranoid schizophrenics.

Bush supporters and detractors, alike, have made much of Ms. Noonan&amp;rsquo;s Friday Opinion Journal column about President Bush. As a fan Peggy&amp;rsquo;s, I was disappointed.

But the new al-Qaeda video featuring a haggard Osama bin Laden has folks speculating about his health and even his life.
Gateway Pundit compares the most recent video (in which bin Laden appears for less than a minute) with a video from 2002. The background and bin Laden&amp;rsquo;s attire are identical. And doesn&amp;rsquo;t look so hot.

For instance, at Abiliti Solutions (now FTS), we produced telecommunications billing and analysis software, a part of which included electronic bill (or invoice) presentment and payment.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s—even after 9/11—the people I worked with were friends.

                Recently, I’ve had the task of explaining to clients why it’s more difficult and error-prone to change their web applications’ configuration metadata than to change code. They don’t take my story well. After all, the whole idea of many web applications is configurability. By that I mean that a non-programmer can change, add, or remove values that cause either business rules, workflows, navigation flows, or content of a web site to change.

                When I revived this blog some months ago, I decided to set Chesterton as my ambition.� Not to rival him, of course.� But to embody his jovial, lively spirit.� To write from his point of view.�
Go back to 1993, when I wrote _The Conservative Manifesto:_� my goal was to carry on in the tradition of William F. Buckley Jr.� After the book, I wrote for the fledgeling Town Hall Forum on CompuServe three times a week from August 1993 to about July 1995.

The only good thing about the current balance of power, in my book, is that we can safely oppose everything Congress does or tries to do with absolute confidence that our position is the correct one.

                **UPDATE Mark Noonan posits several critical questions for Pelosi and Reid.
 Last September, a group of St. Louis Cardinals fans would call local sports talk shows and say they hoped the team wouldn’t make the playoffs. They commented similar sentiments on various Cardinals forums and blogs. When the Cardinals lost a game, they’d gloat, making fun of the “kool-aid guzzlers” who wanted the team to make the playoffs. Claiming that losing was in the team’s best interest, they cheered for any team the Cardinals played, including the Chicago Cubs.

Somehow, though, the team that lost something like 114 games in their last 12 rallied in the bottom of the first and the bottom of the sixth to wash their wealthy hands of the San Diego Padres.

                It’s hard to understand why the United Nations in the late 1940s worked so hard to establish the Jewish state of Israel. Sadism? Since Israel’s declaration of independence, the UN has, more or less, condemned everything the country has done. Were Israel to play by the United Nations’ rules, the world’s only Jewish state would have ceased to exist several decades ago.
Still, it persists. They persist, I should say. The government, the land, does not persist.

We all learned in grade school that the &amp;ldquo;original&amp;rdquo; Americans were those who came across the Bering Straights about 3,000 years ago. They migrated from present day Alaska to Canada, the US, Central and South America. Then the white man came from Europe, spread disease and pestilence, herded them into corrals known as reservations, raped the women and cattle, killed all the bison, cut down the pristine forests, and placed onerous taxes on all that was left standing.

Now, I have one. I bought it on Sunday, and it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful, even though it was cheap.
Oh, Pope Benedict agrees with me.

                If Paul Mirecki, the KU Professor who wanted to teach a class that presented Intelligent Design (and anything else vaguely religious) as myth, then withdrew the class when his bigotry against religion came to public attention, then claimed he was beaten by two white men in a pick-up truck over his religious views, has lost another round in his PR battle.

Today, KU officials released a statement (thanks to Lawrence Journal-World) that included:

                Thanks to Katherine Lopez at NRO The Corner, I learned a valuable lesson that all Catholics should heed: The true meaning of Christmas is about increasing the minimum wage.
Let&amp;rsquo;s hope Ted Kennedy&amp;rsquo;s theological insights make to the Vatican before the Pope writes his homily for Midnight Mass. We&amp;rsquo;d hate to mis-catechize the Christian world by talking about Jesus when Christmas is really about hourly wages, health insurance, and campaign contributions from unions.

I considered writing about thesilliness coming from Tookie Williams supporters. None of the stories I read quoted anyone who is unswervingly pro-life. No, the stories quoted people who think murderers are cool, but state laws that punish murderers with a taste of their own medicine are evil.

                Stanley &amp;ldquo;Tookie&amp;rdquo; Williams lived a wasted life. He chose, at an early age, to kill for money, to sell drugs, to destroy families (including his own), and to make life for others as miserable as he&amp;rsquo;d made his own. He founded a street gang and supervised its stretch from Los Angeles to almost every major city in the US. With the help of a fawning press and Hollywood, murdering for kicks in the Tookie Williams style became as glamorous as murdering for politics did with the Black Panthers.

                Anti-Religion Religion professor, Paul Mirecki, has retained a lawyer to investigate the possibility of suing the University of Kansas for denying him rights under the First Amendment. A Law Professor reviews the possiblities for Mirecki and KU. Paul M. Secunda, an associate professor of law at University of Mississippi says Mirecki might have a difficult time building a case against KU.
 From a public employment standpoint, Mirecki would not seem to have a procedural due process claim against Kansas, as public employees are not seen as having a property interest in administrative positions such as the chairmanship of the department as opposed to having such interests in their professorial positions.

                Michelle Malkin has done great digging and found more holes in Prof. Paul Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s (see this and this) beating story than in Howard Dean&amp;rsquo;s brain.
For instance, Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s description of injuries do not match the hospitals. The police report gives very little evidence. Mirecki&amp;rsquo;s claim, that he got out of his truck to confront two yahoos who were crowding him makes little sense UNLESS Mirecki is the kind of guy who likes to settle things with his fists (which would greatly increase my respect for the guy).

As with pro-terrorist professor Ward Churchill, Mirecki has a long paper trail of opposing those with faith, particularly Catholics and Jews. Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt from Cashill&amp;rsquo;s outstanding piece.
  In response to a SOMA communicant outraged that students were distributing free Bibles on campus, Mirecki told of how he had conceived an &amp;ldquo;anti-Bible tract&amp;rdquo; to counter the Christian presence.

According to Fox News, a University of Kansas professor who created a class designed to attack Christianity and Intelligent Design theories was beaten by a couple of thugs yesterday.
 Last week, Mirecki asked the university to cancel the class after he created a furor by sending an e-mail to a student organization mocking Christian fundamentalists.
 Mirecki had referred to religious conservatives as &amp;ldquo;fundies,&amp;rdquo; and said a course describing intelligent design as mythology would be a &amp;ldquo;nice slap in their big fat face.

                Today I saw two Veterans for Kerry bumperstickers on my way to work. I wonder if the people who emblazoned their cars with those stickers are really veterans. If so, do they consider themselves terrorists? Their choice for CINC &amp;lsquo;04 does.
Yesterday on CBS&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Face the Nation,&amp;rdquo; Senator Kerry said
 And there is no reason, Bob, that young American soldiers need to be going into the homes of Iraqis in the dead of night, terrorizing kids and children, you know, women, breaking sort of the customs of the&amp;ndash;of&amp;ndash;the historical customs, religious customs.

                Yes, there are many other things to write about. My move to Ballwin, Missouri has interrupted both my observations of the world at large and my commenting on them. Still, a singularly inspiring photo caught my eye: The evil, hate-mongering Benedict XVI plays nice with the new Palestinian leader. When I was a cynical young man, I&amp;rsquo;d have made good humor about this. Today, though, and only by God&amp;rsquo;s beneficence, I see nothing but hope.

                One thing I like to do at work is to give my team members a bit of my perspective on things around holidays or significant events. Here&amp;rsquo;s my Thanksgiving message to the troops.
A wise man I once worked for, Tom Merta, had a simple yet profound view of life and work: You can get anything you want in life by helping enough other people get what they want.
When others demands seem overwhelming and pointless, when deadlines seem arbitrary, when commitments seem only burdens with no reward, I have to remind myself of the obvious simplicity of Toms motto.

                The recent attacks onMichelle Malkin are mere evidence of the theologically unassailable fact that Satan is to modern liberalism what the KGB was to SANE/Freeze. Of course, liberals don&amp;rsquo;t believe in Satan or God or Hell or Heaven. (If the road to hell be paved with good intentions, then hell&amp;rsquo;s bowels gurgle and belch with the dyspeptic cosmic waste of those who disbelieved in eternal punishment.)
And while those calling themselves &amp;ldquo;conservatives&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;of the right&amp;rdquo; resort to base name-calling and mudslinging, it is far worse, far more self-damning, when a liberal does it.

                The correlation between liberalism and selfishness is too easy to make. Atheistic liberalism gives selfishness a whole new dimension. But liberals, who in their selfishness consider themselves the epitome of compassion, say you can&amp;rsquo;t measure compassion.
I utterly refute that idiot sentiment. And it is nothing more than mere sentiment.
Via FoxNews.com, we learn that folks in liberal states spend their money almost exclusively on themselves, while &amp;ldquo;Bible belt&amp;rdquo; people spend money on those who need help.

In an interview with Newsweek (on MSNBC.com), Rice says that her reconversion will be the sole focus of her future writing.
 In two weeks, Anne Rice, the chronicler of vampires, witches andunder the pseudonym A. N. Roquelaureof soft-core S&amp;amp;M encounters, will publish &amp;ldquo;Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt,&amp;rdquo; a novel about the 7-year-old Jesus, narrated by Christ himself.

Before making landfall 6 hours earlier than currently projected, the hurricane will pick up speed to &amp;gt; 20 mph, weaken to &amp;lt; cat. 3 and make landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border as a mid-category 2.

Not because I oppose breast cancer research, but because something about that particular organization rubbed me the wrong way. For one thing, it seemed too big, too intrusive. It was like a charity version of the AFL-CIO, before it collapsed.

 Last Thursday Catholic World News transmitted this story, filed out of Dublin, regarding what might happen to what is commonly called the Tridentine Mass:
 &amp;ldquo;Pope Benedict XVI will take action soon to allow all Catholic priests to celebrate the Latin Mass, a Cambridge historian has predicted.
&amp;ldquo;Speaking to a conference of priests in Ireland earlier this week, Eamonn Duffy said that it was &amp;lsquo;extremely likely that Pope Benedict will lift the restrictions on the celebration of the Tridentine liturgy,&amp;rsquo; the Irish Independent reported.

                TheNew York Times Online, today, is drumming up sympathy for abortion.
 Venetia Grunder, 21, viewed an ultrasound image of the fetus in her womb. She was 12 weeks pregnant, though she had taken birth control pills as directed. &amp;ldquo;I feel pretty messed up,&amp;rdquo; she said after seeing the image. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s different, just knowing. My husband told me not to look. This changes my feelings, but I&amp;rsquo;m sticking by it. Damn it, $650, I&amp;rsquo;m sticking by it.

                Once upon a time, men and women separated themselves from society in order to pray. Often, their piety attracted like-minded individuals to join them. Among early Christians, the practice became fairly common, and continued through the middle ages and even after the Reformation. While that may not be an official definition of monasticism, it fits.
One can only imagine that forming a new religious order was easier in the days of the great kings of Europe than it would be today.

Genius isn&amp;rsquo;t required to see that the relief efforts in Republican-conrolled Mississippi, with far more storm damage than Louisiana, is relatively smooth. Like Florida&amp;rsquo;s Jeb Bush, Haley Barbour seems to know what he&amp;rsquo;s doing.

                The people at Planned Parenthood are the kinds of cowards who give cowardice a bad name.
Dawn Eden demonstrated, today, how Planned Parenthood tried to divert money for Katrina Relief into their own abortion mills. Now, if you&amp;rsquo;re eugenicist, racist, baby-killer like those who run and support and profit from Planned Parenthood, then the their logic will make sense:
 a) Most of the really, really brutalized victims of Katrina we saw on television were poor blacks; b) if there weren&amp;rsquo;t so darn many poor blacks, the hurricane&amp;rsquo;s effect would have been far less catastrophic; therefore, c) if we prevent poor blacks from breeding, we will avoid future Katrinas.

 Perhaps we fortunate souls in the rest of the country should begin a ring of volunteers willing to put up a displaced person or family until they can get back on their feet. Im sure the government will help relocate folks. While St. Louis isnt exactly Louisiannas backyard, our door is open to such a family in need.

William Rehnquist was never a politician. He was just a judge. His devotion to the Constitution was amazing. He never deviated from his path of original understanding and legislsative intent. When Rehnquist authored an opinion, it was right in the eyes of the law, in the eyes of democracy, and in the eyes of God.

 At every turn, political leaders failed Katrina&amp;rsquo;s victims. They didn&amp;rsquo;t strengthen the levees. They ceded the streets to marauding looters. They left dead bodies to rot or bloat. Thousands suffered or died for lack of water, food and hope. Who&amp;rsquo;s at fault?
 There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of blame to go around - the White House, Congress, federal agencies, local governments, police and even residents of the Gulf Coast who refused orders to evacuate.

                Anyone who has anything nice to say about Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Firefox browser has such because of emotional bigotry, not objective analysis.
I have been running Firefox on both Linux (SuSE&amp;rsquo;s latest) and Windows (XP Pro SP2) since beta days. With each release and each patch, I expect the uncountable list of problems to abate. Instead, the list grows only longer.
On Windows, Firefox has plenty of plug-ins, though not enough. It freezes constantly.

                In the continuing story of the resurgence of Roman Catholicism, Newsweek online reports on an orthodox Catholic frat at Franciscan University: Knights of the Holy Queen.
Many on the Catholic right have long argued the church&amp;rsquo;s decline began with Pope Paul&amp;rsquo;s misguided reform of the Holy Mass in 1968. During the 1970s, Catholic dioceses and parishes in the Western world purged their sanctuaries of Christ, the Crucifix, the Blessed Mother, God, prayer, reverence, and holiness, replacing these &amp;ldquo;relics&amp;rdquo; with worship of the profane, the creature, the created.

Several times, I have expressed my disappointment in the way some administrators in his former middle school, from which he has since matriculated, handled his problems.
For his privacy, I never referred to the child in question as my son. I never used his name. And for their privacy, I never named the administrators with whom I disagreed.

                Once upon a time, I craved Holy Communion. Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind being the ONLY PERSON IN THE CHURCH who doesn&amp;rsquo;t go up to receive the true Body and Blood of our savior each mass. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m kind of proud of that. While there&amp;rsquo;s nothing honorable about being the only person in the church in a state of mortal sin (there&amp;rsquo;s hell to pay), but there is some honor, I think, in being the only one, at least at Daily Mass, to admit it.

Women want to feel safe. They seek out men who can protect them. Sorry, but it&amp;rsquo;s true.
When a woman feels that her man can no longer protect her or their children, she has no use for him. Humor, cooking, intellect, whatever other qualities he might have become meaningless. They were only perquisites stacked atop his primary attraction: safety.

Jennings didn&amp;rsquo;t last long. Berated by critics as a pretty face, ABC demoted him to foreign correspondent in 1968. In London, Munich, Brussels, and other foreign capitals, Jennings paid his dues.

                The Roman Catholic Episcopate is set to introduce sweeping changes to the Latin Rite liturgy during its General Synod, October 2 through October 23, 2005.
According to the agendum for the synod, which Catholics should read here, the following points will be addressed:
* Intensive catechesis on the importance of keeping the Holy Days of Obligation, particularly the Sunday requirement. * Dignity, due preparation, and faith in the mystery of the Eucharist * The secularization of salvation and religious relativism * Understanding that &amp;quot;participation&amp;quot; in the Mass centers on receiving the Body and Blood of Christ the Redeemer, not standing in the sanctuary with your hands in the air in imitation of a priest.

 A couple of short strips of material dangling from Discoverys belly may require an unprecedented repair by spacewalking astronauts, if engineers determine theres even a possibility that the problem could endanger the shuttle during descent, NASA said Sunday.
 If this Space Shuttle does not come back in one piece, as much as I hate to switch sides on this one, it&amp;rsquo;s time to get the government out of the space program.

Israeli intelligence reports that the large network of al-Qaeda web sites, the organizations primary means of international communication, have been taken out of service. The Israelis believe UK intelligence did the Lord&amp;rsquo;s work on this case, reports the Times of London.
 Over the past fortnight Israeli intelligence agents have noticed something distinctly odd happening on the internet. One by one, Al-Qaedas affiliated websites have vanished until only a handful remain, write Uzi Mahnaimi and Alex Pell.

                From Catholic News Agency:
 BALLYMENA, NORTHERN IRELAND, Ireland, July 27 (CNA) - Tuesday saw what police have called a wave of intimidation attacks against Catholics in and around Ballymena, a mostly Protestant town northwest of Belfast.
 The Associated Press reported that Protestant extremists planted a homemade grenade outside a Catholic family&amp;rsquo;s home in Ballymena. The bomb detonated, causing minor damage. Arsonists badly damaged one Catholic-run pub in the village of Martinstown, and caused minor fire damage to the outside of another pub in nearby Rasharkin with two gasoline-filled bottles.

                Since I last blogged about the curious financial dealings (stealing from the poor to line the pockets of rich liberals), Err America has released two mutually exclusive denials of criminal wrong-doing (guilty as charged). (See Macho Nachos)
Michelle Malkin has done a great job on this story, finding the loopholes in Franken&amp;rsquo;s loopholes.
Those of us who always assume the worst motives of limosine liberals are alway right. There&amp;rsquo;s a satisfying justice in that, like when we learned that Barbara Streisand believes people like her are exempt from the need to protect the environment, or when theDave Matthews Band illegally dumps human feces all over boaters in Chicago.

                On Wednesday, Pope Benedict XVI spoke to Italian clergy, and his statements seem, at first blush, rather sad. He told the assembled that Christian churches in the West appear to be dying. In particular, the so-called mainline Protestant churches have been losing members for nearly a century.
Jay Anderson at Pro Ecclesia conjectures:
 &amp;ldquo;Mainstream churches&amp;rdquo; appear to be dying. Well, then, they aren&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo;, are they? Just like the dying &amp;ldquo;mainstream media&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo;.

Mr. Ferguson has called upon the Canadian government to regulate religion in that country, especially the Roman Catholic Church. Succumbing to the whispers of the dark one, Ferguson let loose this commentary on CBC radio:

                So it appears. According to Michelle Malkin, Ed Morrissey, Brian Maloney, The Bronx News, and other sources, several federally supported relief agencies in New York have been illegally funelling hundreds of thousands of dollars to Al Franken&amp;rsquo;s anti-American radio network Air America.
The agencies in question, Gloria Wise Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club and Pathways for Youth Boys &amp;amp; Girls clubs.
 One source told the News that $480,000 in funds from the Gloria Wise Club is involved in the citys investigation of illegal transfer of funds from the local club.

Suffice it to say that two weeks ago, something my wife and I had been praying hard for seemed to have been placed out of reach.

Thankfully, though, we didn&amp;rsquo;t stop. I went straight to the perpetual adoration chapel and knelt before the exposed Body of Christ for an hour and a half.

                Since the beginning of the labor union movement, the greatest threat it felt&amp;ndash;often paranoically&amp;ndash;was management (or the Republicans) &amp;ldquo;breaking&amp;rdquo; the union. The external threat was seen to come from anti-union laws, movement of jobs overseas, and negotiating tactics that left union strikes powerless. Now, it seems, that the union movement may, like communism, collapse from its own weight.
After a steady 20&#43; year decline in union membership, the flagship of organized labor, the AFL-CIO, fractured this week, losing more than 1/3 of its membership.

* I accept the teaching of the Second Vatican Council as bound in heaven as on earth. * I accept the validity of the New Mass based on the church&#39;s Magisterium and the indefectability of the church. * I do not believe that people who attend (by choice) New Mass are living outside the faith.

                The National Cancer Institute funded a Chinese study that links induced abortion to a signficantly increased risk of breast cancer. But the results were politically incorrect, so the NCI buried the study, according to Purposeful Dreamer.
It appears, now, the NCI is removing all copies of the study from the internet in a Soviet-style attempt to whitewash history. Still, pdf copies remain, and here is a link to one.

                The Canadian Conference of Bishops bravely demanded that Catholics continue to resist Canada&amp;rsquo;s attempt to redifine marriage.
 Catholics are to continue to oppose it, and to ensure that all provincial and territorial regulations on the solemnization of marriages provide full protection for freedom of conscience and religion, as guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
 Meanwhile, in Spain, a judge, Laura Alabau, has refused to marry a lesbian couple and is appealing to that country&amp;rsquo;s high court to overturn the law.

                My first foray into editing Wikipedia happened when I found some really bad etymology of St. Peter&amp;rsquo;s name. Following the misteaching of some Protestant theology, a well-meaning soul had written that Christ Jesus gave Symon the name &amp;ldquo;Petros,&amp;rdquo; then turned to a rocky cliff and said, &amp;ldquo;And upon this petra I will build my church.&amp;rdquo; (Since my edits, though, the entry has been radically altered.)
Petros, in Greek, is a little rock.

                Now that Canada has made homosexual &amp;ldquo;marriage&amp;rdquo; the law of the land, it won&amp;rsquo;t be long before Catholic priests are imprisoned for refusing to preside over such blasphemy. Though Canadian Liberals assure us that the law applies specifically to &amp;ldquo;civil&amp;rdquo; marriages, there is no protection against civil suits against priests who refuse to conduct homosexual marriage ceremonies. And we all know how much liberals enjoy suing.
The good news is that the situation may provide an opportunity for Canadian martyrs, of which there are few.

MSNBC reports that Tony Blair has appealed for calm. That seems superfluous in England where the good people showed such commendable fortitude after the last bombs.
Thanks to God, the human toll was much lower this time:
 Only one person was reported wounded in Thursday&amp;rsquo;s blasts, but Blair said the intention of the attacks must have been to kill.
 And one of the bombers, this time, may have survived the attack.

                This quote from Neal Pollack is two years old, but I just found it. I like it so much, I&amp;rsquo;m blogging it in hopes that no one will ever forget what an idiot Howard Dean is.
 It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why people are seduced by Howard Dean. He&amp;rsquo;s well-spoken, handsome, and sensible. He appears to have a strong grasp on most major issues, a willingness to compromise with his opponents, and the gift of not getting flustered by minor annoyances.

This afternoon I joined ProLifeBlogs.org and tonight, on that blog, I found the thrust of a theory the theological side of my brain has been pondering for some time (though it&amp;rsquo;s not time to expose it just yet):
The UN wants to eliminate poverty by eliminating children.

 Messianic Jews, like Christians, believe that Jesus (or as they refer to him, Y&amp;rsquo;Shua) was the expected Messiah. Though they claim to be following the true Judaism, mainstream Jews are nearly unanimous in rejecting the idea that Messianic Jews are Jewish, and many believe them to be Christians intentionally targeting Jews for conversion.

But in the midst of the carnage, terror, and mayhem, Prime Minister Winston Churchill found the time to address the people of the United States. He encouraged us to keep a stiff upper lip.

                Yeah, I know. But when a major news network (NBC) equates America&amp;rsquo;s Founders with Usama bin Laden and the only people to react are conservatives, maybe this great experiment in self-governance has failed.
It seems to me that the only remaining battle is The God Fearing vs. Everyone Else. If I have to die for something I believe in, better God than the people who watch NBC news.

Thank you for giving us the Tridentine Mass at the beautiful St. Francis de Sales church.
I grew up, mostly, in the Novus Ordo Missae. Over the past 30 years, I have seen the Mass go from a reverent, prayerful worship of God, to a social gathering, to, now, something that seems more like a baseball game. I use Perpetual Adoration, the daily Rosary, and novenas to pray, because prayer during Mass has become almost impossible.

                You walk up a flight of granite stairs to a pair great wooden doors beneath a spire rising, it seems, miles toward the heavens. The heavy door opens slowly, because of its weight, but surprisingly easily, like a perfectly balance vault door.
The vestibule is dark and reverent, not grand at all. It might be the foyer of an old, downtown office building except for the small stained-glass windows. Then to the inner doors, smaller, but heavy and wooden.

Until very recently, the Church of England was more closely united with the Roman Catholic church than any mainstream Protestant church.
It is because of the Anglican church&amp;rsquo;s proximity to Rome that I desire its internal reformation.
The Anglicans gave us Dr.

                I used to think that atheists were the most dangerous creatures on earth. After all, the creature that disavows its creator is a pretty wretched thing. Lately, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking down a different path.
Is it possible that the most dangerous thing on earth is the believer who doesn&amp;rsquo;t trust God?
Someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in God is capable of doing great harm to himself, his family, and his community.

                Thanks toRomanCatholicBlog, I found this essay on abused liturgy by one of my heroes, Fr. James Schall, author of &amp;ldquo;Another Sort of Learning.&amp;rdquo;
Father&amp;rsquo;s Day, we attended Mass with my in-laws, including my wife&amp;rsquo;s grandfather, in Illinois. Instead of a homily, the priest decided to (ab)use that portion of the Holy Sacrifice to conduct a survey. Ushers passed out forms like baseball All-Star ballots. Those of us who were not members of the parish were left to sit and pray amongst ourselves while the parishioners applied their number 2 pencils to the little dots.

                I&amp;rsquo;m not a certified apologist or anything, but after 15 years of Catholic education I have a pretty good headful of catechetics. I think the reason I never actually asked my wife to become Catholic was that I enjoyed my position as household expert on the church. My wife is a lot smarter than I am, much better educated, and much dedicated to the things she finds important.
A month and a half ago, she began &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo; about becoming Catholic.

                Last night, I was lucky enough to have my second hour before the exposed Eucharist in one week. My wife was out of town with the kids, so I took her place.
My usual hour is in the morning, before work. The sun is up, the room is bright. It&amp;rsquo;s like Easter morning.
But in the evening, it&amp;rsquo;s different. It&amp;rsquo;s more like the Agony in the Garden. The room seems larger and darker.

It&amp;rsquo;s symptomatic of the reason I turned toward God: this world loves sin, lies, and death. It hates goodness, truth, and life.

I know some took offence at my original swipe at the Anglican church last week. I even felt a little writer&amp;rsquo;s remorse, thinking, maybe, I&amp;rsquo;d been over the top. But God works, sometimes, in obvious ways. Aside from tacking a list of 95 Antitheses to their own heads and declaring God dead, I cannot think of surer way than The Clown Eurcharist to demonstrate to the world that one considers his own religion a joke.

Her diary, at 700 pages, is the most powerful testimony of faith I have ever read. Those who do not understand the joy of suffering for God must read this work of pure faith. Before I picked up the text last month, I was familiar with the phrase &amp;ldquo;offer it up.

Conversion stories are among the most importat to reinforcing faith. All of the Epistles, really, were testimony to conversions of Jews, pagans, Greeks, Romans, and others. We learn so much about our faith from those who came to faith as adults or who returned after being adrift in secular confusion.

                Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska adored silence. Only through her special relationship with Jesus Christ could she find the inner strength to pray, to contemplate, worship, and hear God, amid the din of her convent. I can only imagine the cacophony of that house of nuns.
With Mothers Day commitments abound, I was reduced to attending 5:30 Mass tonight. I lasted 10 minutes18 if you count the time before the Mass started.

                A high school in Columbus, GA suspended a 17-year-old student for taking a cell phone call from his mother who is serving our country in Iraq.
 The confrontation Wednesday began after the 17-year-old junior got a call at lunchtime from his mother, Sgt. 1st Class Monique Bates, who left in January for a one-year tour with the 203rd Forward Support Battalion. (USAToday)

                Chesterton, comparing and contrasting Sts. Francis of Assisi with St. Thomas Aquinas, said, &amp;ldquo;[I]t is the paradox of history that each generation is converted by the saint who contradicts it most.&amp;rdquo;
Chesterton was not a prophet, but a genius. As such, his observations of history serve as predictions of the future. Pope John Paul II became pope when detente was still in the air, when Jimmy Carter was urging the world to accept the perpetualism of Soviet communism, when Americans were told that our best days were behind us.

His message made me realize that I had been, up to that point, too vague about how to fear God. I wrote him:
 Thank you. Your words are comforting, though I don&amp;rsquo;t have much fear of God, except the kind of fear one naturally has toward something of incomprehensible greatness.

 Ethanol prices have declined sharply in recent months, largely because of the rapid growth in supply and few new markets. Shaw maintains that refiners are ignoring ethanol and keeping the additive out of some markets where it is readily available.

Why?
Because seeing a picture of an unborn child tends to turn women against whimsical murder&amp;ndash;the chief form of amusement for Planned Parenthood.

                A few years back (quite a few), I picked up a copy of Esquire at an airport news stand. I think I was in Charleston, but it might have been Atlanta. It was hot. The issue contained the best American short stories of the year&amp;ndash;judged by whom, I do not know.
Whoever they were, they got one right.
I wish I remembered the story or the name of the Saul Bellow entry.

                I planned to write a column-length piece today. I even mapped out an outline: Terri Schiavo, Jesse Jackson, the Colorado Supreme Court.
Then the Pope died.
I sat here for a couple of hours trying to think of something to write. I thought of much. Unfortunately, none of the things would interest readers.
There&amp;rsquo;s been too much death lately. Minnesota, Terri Schiavo, little girls in Nebraska and Florida, the Pope, even Johnnie Cochran.

                The Vatican just announced that the Pope suffered heart failure earlier this evening. Dr. Arthur St. Andre says that he may . . . may . . . be surviving only on his IV to keep his blood pressure up. The Vatican describes the pontiff as seriously ill but lucid and comfortable. There are reports that doctors recommended he return to the hospital, but he personally declined. Obviously, he wants to die at what has been his home for the past quarter century.

My contention was that Ms. Derse had established a pattern of anti-military behavior, to which she responds:

In 1999, I wrote a little ASP application that would allow me to write a few columns a week at my leisure. Soon, I found myself a single father, though, and had no time to write.

                Police barred Terri Schiavo from receiving the sacrament of communion today. For Easter, I wanted to express some thoughts on the Catholic church&amp;ndash;the community that Judge Greer has isolated Terri from.
 Nine out of ten of what we call new ideas are simply old mistakes. The Catholic Church has for one of her chief duties that of preventing people from making those old mistakes; from making them over and over again forever, as people always do if they are left to themselves.

 Pinellas Circuit Judge George Greer (search) rejected their argument that Schiavo tried to say &amp;ldquo;I want to live&amp;rdquo; hours before her tube was removed March 18. They argued that she said &amp;ldquo;AHHHHH&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;WAAAAAAA&amp;rdquo; when asked to repeat the phrase.

 A state judge on Saturday rejected another attempt by Terri Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s parents to reconnect her feeding tube, rejecting what the couple&amp;rsquo;s lawyer described as their last chance to keep their severely brain-damaged daughter alive.
 The Schindlers said they will not appeal again.
Those who have sacrificed, prayed, e-mailed, blogged, hoped, and cried for Terri may feel defeated.

 Hours after a judge ordered that Terri Schiavo was not to be removed from her hospice, a team of state agents were en route to seize her and have her feeding tube reinserted &amp;ndash; but they stopped short when local police told them they would enforce the judge&amp;rsquo;s order, The Herald has learned.

The affidavit is stunning. There were numerous witnesses who heard Terri say &amp;ldquo;Aaah&amp;rdquo; and then yell &amp;ldquo;Waahn.&amp;rdquo; Among the witnesses was a female police officer.

                The family of Terri Schiavo is holdin a press conference.
Mrs. Schindler: Governor Bush, you can save our daughter.
Mr. Schindler: This is judicial tyranny. They are determined to kill my daughter. Governor Bush can stop this with the stroke of a pen. They put Terri through a week of hell. I implore him to put a stop to this. This is judicial homocide, and he has to stop he. He kind hide behind a political agenda.

                My daughter died of complications from childhood diabetes more than 10 years ago. At the time, I was warned that diabetes research charities are not very interested in finding a cure. That would put them out of business. Moreover, JDRF seems to prefer people dying to giving up its political bent on stem-cells:
 SCIENCE DID publish the study demonstrating that adult spleen stem cells completely cured mice with late stage juv.

For that matter, why don&amp;rsquo;t they take a page from the Terri Schiavo story and supply arms and ammo to the team that&amp;rsquo;s winning?
Instead, the UN Security Council, yesterday, took the baby step of approving a peace keeping force for the country.

                I have to agree withEd Morrissey on this: Governor Bush has done all he can do, and he must not violate the law to save Terri Schiavo.
That might sound callous, but staying within the law is now our last refuge. As Thomas More told Will Roper in Robert Bolt&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;A Man for All Seasons&amp;quot;:
 This country&amp;rsquo;s planted thick with laws from coast to coast &amp;ndash; man&amp;rsquo;s laws, not God&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash; and if you cut them down &amp;ndash; and you&amp;rsquo;re just the man to do it &amp;ndash; d&amp;rsquo;you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then?

You were one of many citizens who wrote or called the University of Colorado at Boulder concerning the controversial essay about 9/11 written by Professor Ward Churchill.

We have been active indemanding action from the Seattle School Board over a disgusting political ambush of American service members last week.
Upon further review of theletters and e-mails issued by the Seattle School Board and Susan Derse, principal of West Seattle High School, I am determined to garner a more substantive response. Specifically, I expect every adult involved to apologize directly to the ambushed service member and to all members, veterans, and their families.

Terri&amp;rsquo;s life is in God&amp;rsquo;s hands. In truth, it always has been.
Those who have fought valiently to save Ms. Schiavo must take pride in having fought a good fight. Whatever Michael Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s motives may have been, and whatever the motives of those who took his side, we are best to assume their intentions noble absent evidence to the contrary.

It turns out that St. Louis had its 17th warmest winter on record. Meteorological winter in St. Louis runs from December 1 through February 28, so the exceptionally cool March won&amp;rsquo;t change the fact. Still, 17th out of 130 does not seem dramatic at all.

I figured Siegel an atheist. He&amp;rsquo;s not. He believes in God, but he&amp;rsquo;s angry at Him. Very angry.
I wonder if a lot of atheists are actually just believers angry that they&amp;rsquo;re not God.
In Luigi Pirandello&amp;rsquo;s Six Characters in Search of an Author, we learn the absurdity of anger at one&amp;rsquo;s creator.

   it is worth remembering that the excruciating slowness of the execution here, the incremental-ness of death, is designed by its champions to inure us to it. After the first hour, the second passes with far less fanfare, and the third less still. I&amp;rsquo;ve been following this closely, and I needed to remind myself today how many hours Terri Schiavo has actually been without sustenance by counting the days since Friday afternoon and multiplying by 24.

 The guy on the street is often wrong about general principles of his environment. In other words, when a non-expert pontificates about the weather, the human brain, or the government, he&amp;rsquo;s very likely to come off as Cliff Clavin.
Experts, on the other hand, are usually expert only about general nature of a specific study.

Maybe the guy isn&amp;rsquo;t an English major, but any teacher should be able to write a decent letter. Were I grading this in a basic Business Writing class, I would give it a D. My comments in bold:

                There&amp;rsquo;s not much to say. Judges have determined, in logical order, the following:
A. Michael Schiavo is Terri Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s husband; therefore, B. Michael Schiavo is Terri&amp;rsquo;s legal guardian; therefore, C. Michael Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s desires trump laws of the state and of morality.
Florida law does not permit the execution of a person in Terri Schiavo&amp;rsquo;s condition. The judges (like Glenn Reynolds and James Joyner and others) are too cowardly to come out and say, &amp;ldquo;Look, people, the mentally ill make us kind of sick.

                Many people, including many conservative bloggers, believe that justice has been served in Florida. Terri Schiavo should be starved to death as ordered by Judge Greer. (And, please, don&amp;rsquo;t insult my integrity or intelligence by claiming he ordered otherwise. His order prohibits anyone from giving the woman food, water, or any other nutrients. He ordered her starved to death, not denied artificial support.) Well, I think that most of the people who support her murder must be ignorant of what they wish for.

Why?

Unfortunately, the current version of .Text is not ready for prime time.

 Yesterday, I pointed out that, as individuals, we need to look on the Terri Schiavo ordeal from God&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint. But that&amp;rsquo;s the individual issue. Beyond that, we have to contend with the political/judicial aspects of this case.

 Some people hate peace. Tonight, some of them detonated a car bomb in Beirut. Likely, the goal is to divide Christians from Muslims.

                Today before the United States House of Representatives, former major league baseball player and one-time single season home run champion Mark McGwire disgraced himself, his profession, and his career.
Under friendly questioning from William Clay Jr., (D-MO), McGwire repeatedly refused to say if he&amp;rsquo;d ever taken even andro, which he more or less bragged about using when he was a Cardinal.
Clearly, McGwire was a heavy steroid user. I didn&amp;rsquo;t believe so just two weeks ago, but he looked as guilty as OJ today.

Max Baucus, D-Mont., one of the Democrats arrayed behind Reid on the Capitol steps. &amp;ldquo;It would mean the government could not function, which, more importantly, means we could not be doing the people&amp;rsquo;s work.

Until today, I was more interested in the Wisconsin church shooting.
Then something happened.

   The man who fatally shot seven people during a quiet church service before turning the gun on himself was on the verge of losing his job and upset over a sermon he heard two weeks ago, investigators said Sunday.
 Let me get this straight: this guys having a tough time personally, then a sermon ticks him off. He gets his gun, goes to church, and kills a bunch of people, then himself.

                European Union investigators are trying to pin the disappearance of Muslim terrorists on the CIA., according to this story on MSNBC.
What of it? Suppose the CIA is abducting terrorists like Abu Omar and secreting them off to Kuwait or Egypt or Saudi Arabia? So what? Would Italy prefer to harbor these monsters indefinitely?
This is a war against the kinds people who consider mere torture sport. If the abduction and aggressive interrogation of one sicko Muslim radical reveals enough information to thwart a future attack, the practice justifies itself.

Crichton is actually an environmentalist and liberal, but once one strays off of the liberal plantation, he is no-good runner with rabbit in his blood who must be destroyed.
Dismissing Nicholas Kristof&amp;rsquo;s NYT Op-Ed column on the subject, though, may prove troublesome for tree huggers. Kristof&amp;rsquo;s environmentalist credentials are even more solid than Crichton&amp;rsquo;s, and his life includes the kind of humanitarian missions leftists talk about but rarely perform.

Blind Mind&amp;rsquo;s Eye: A challenge to social conservatives who are upset by the Supreme Court ruling on executing minors
   As a more moderate libertarian, I have no particular problem with the death penalty, but do find in many ways the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s ruling to be consistent with how many want to view teenagers in this society.
 Mike makes some interesting assumptions about social conservatives&amp;rsquo; views of teens.

Today, the people who wish they were Irish held a parade in Downtown St. Louis. I didn&amp;rsquo;t go, of course, because I attend the annual Ancient Order of Hibernian&amp;rsquo;s Dogtown Parade on the 17th.
The Hennessys meet at West Park and Tamm. Stop by if you&amp;rsquo;re about. After the parade, we&amp;rsquo;re making the trek to Ellisville for Matt and Angie Clancy&amp;rsquo;s fantastic Corned Beef and Cabbage.

Yahoo! News - DNA Evidence Found in Judge Killings Case
   _A DNA match from a cigarette butt convinced police that a Chicago electrician was the killer of a federal judge&amp;rsquo;s husband and mother, authorities said. _
 For a week, the leftist press typed its stories with crossed fingers that some white supremist hate group murdered the judges family. Instead, it was a run of the mill, disgruntled plaintiff.

One of the topics of the day was Generation X. People like Rush Limbaugh and others got a kick out of making fun of Xers. They were slackers who wanted to make $45.00 an hour flipping burgers. Or, better, they wanted to graduate from college and step into an eighty grand a year job with a company car.

Captain Ed sums up McCain&amp;rsquo;s chicanery quite well:
   Here we have a man who has done more harm to the First Amendment as anyone in the past generation, all the while scolding us on coordination of electoral efforts, and he&amp;rsquo;s playing a shell game with Cablevision in order to gin up indirect payments to his staff.

Senator John McCain, the Keating Five escapee who put his name on a bill intended to destroy the First Amendment, has been caught with his hand in the till.
According to theAssociated Press, one of the few organizations that stands to gain politically under McCain-Feingold, the Senator and former POW pressed for pricing changes on behalf of Cablevision while soliciting $200,000 from Cablevision for one of McCain&amp;rsquo;s tax-exempt political action committees, The Reform Institute.

                This week, the blogosphere buzzed with reaction to Senator Robert &amp;ldquo;Grand Wizard&amp;rdquo; Byrd&amp;rsquo;s comparison of the Republican Senate leaders to Nazis. His Washington Post op-ed contains some of the most partisan and hate-inspiring language penned by a sitting Senator in modern times.
Some of the shock over Byrd&amp;rsquo;s incendiary comments may arise from the carefully managed but false image of Byrd. The mainstream press, liberal academicians, and historians have, for decades, portrayed Byrd as a kindly, intellectual defender of the Senate&amp;rsquo;s history.

In the best acting, the more &amp;ldquo;make believe&amp;rdquo; the presentation, the more real. A great play demands that you strip the stage of technology and present truth in angry, cold, black and white, two-dimensional reality. Truth shines through, unencumbered by sets and lights.

                The union workers I grew up around weren&amp;rsquo;t liberals by any stretch. They were Archie Bunker (and I mean that in a good way). Since the early 1980s, though, their unions have abandoned putting workers first in favor of putting leftwing ideology first. The result has been a massive exodus from the union shops into non-union companies.
But the unions have also done a disservice to the entire middle class. By concentrating on politics instead of labor issues, the AFL-CIO and other big unions have favored policies that destroy middle class jobs.

 As head of the Iraqi Olympic Committee, Uday oversaw the imprisonment and torture of Iraqi athletes who were deemed not to have performed to expectations.

                Michelle on Right in Texas wonders why some want to ban cities from providing free internet access in Texas. Could it be McCain-Feingold?
UPDATE: Looks like I was way, way off base with this explanation. According to theHouston Chronicle, the Texas legislator sponsoring the bill is Republican Phil King. King&amp;rsquo;s says that when municipalities provide free internet access they screw up the free market.
   King&amp;rsquo;s basic objection, Trainor said, stands  in a free-market system it&amp;rsquo;s not acceptable to let public government compete with private businesses

I wish they would release the version of the Constitution which they read so we citizens, subject to the document as we are, may read it. Clearly, the one published in text books isn&amp;rsquo;t the one given the Supreme Court. Either that, or it reads differently under the magnification of their crystal ball.

                The disturbing case of Ward Churchill has me asking a question I ought not ask, but somehow feel compelled. The NCAA has an arcane, complicated, often brainless set of rules regarding recruitment and pampering of college athletes. The rules require major universities to hire folks just to deal with compliance. I hate bureaucracies like that.
But the system effectively reduces the ability of a college to buy great sports teams. Moreover, the system demands that members require minimum (though way too minimal) education standards for student athletes.

Steven Taylor beat me to this story that the people who provided Churchill a podium from which to spew hatred, terrorism, venom, and lies is considering buying out his contract, as they would with a failing football coach. (But one whose players like to rape girls.) Read the rest on Poliblog.

                About a year ago, I fired off a letter writing campaign to Missouri legistors urging them to fight a movement, sponsored by then-governor Bob Holden, to require Chick Pox vaccines for all Missouri children entering school. Michelle Malkin points out that Ohio has passed such a law with a link to the chicken pox vaccine money trail. (There&amp;rsquo;s always a money trail.)
Mandatory chicken pox vaccines will kill people. According to Dr.

To those who say Churchill speaks for the American Indian better than anyone else, I say that his words that have so enchanted you most likely were plagiarized.
Since Churchill&amp;rsquo;s rabid defenders will not expend the energy to click Michelle&amp;rsquo;s link, here&amp;rsquo;s the pertinent part of a CBS4 in Denver story Michelle reprinted in whole:

Basically, Corn says what we already know: Howard Dean is his own worst enemy, and, as DNC chairman, is turning into his party&amp;rsquo;s worst enemy. Specifially, Corn responds to Dean&amp;rsquo;s recent announcement that people are afraid to call themselves Democrats because &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not socially acceptable to be a Democrat.

                The Chris Rock quote that got so many conservatives so up in arms about abortion appears to be more pro-life than pro-choice, according to John Swansburg writing on Slate.
The controversy involves this line from Rock: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s beautiful that abortion is legal&amp;rdquo; and says that he likes to pick up women at abortion rallies. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Cause you know they&amp;rsquo;re [expletive].&amp;rdquo;
But that isolated sentiment is part of a larger theme in Rock&amp;rsquo;s routine, and, in reasonable context, constitutes a slap at the frivolity of &amp;ldquo;choice.

While I&amp;rsquo;m not quite ready to jump on the Condi 08 bandwagon just yet, this is a very encouraging story for those who have.

The story claims that the good news about Iraq&amp;rsquo;s economy would be inappropriate at a time when so many security problems exist. That rings hollow. The President could use some good news in his European trip, and the whole world could use some good news about Iraq.

   Iraq under Saddam supported international terrorist organizations to bolster Iraq&amp;rsquo;s revolutionary credentials, ensure his own role as Great Arab leader, and intimidate rival governments. In examining the history, methods, and patterns of behavior of Saddam Husayn in supporting international terrorism, some &amp;ldquo;truths&amp;rdquo; stand out.

LaShawn Barber nails it
According to Fox News, over 100 supporters of this cretin packed the courtroom and mocked the proceedings. This raises a few questions, namely, did we place electronic surveillance instruments on them as they were leaving, and did we scan their faces for links to al Qaeda?

                Yeah, I know they won&amp;rsquo;t reply, but I figured I should ask, anyway.
   The Rocky Mountain News today claims that Mr. Ward Churchill received tenure as a result of Colorado University&amp;rsquo;s failure to explore an alleged offer of tenure from the University of California system.
  I am interested in knowing whether or not Mr. Churchill implied such offer was made, or if someone at Colorado merely assumed such.

                Last week, Steven Taylor brought up the fact of Ward Churchill&amp;rsquo;s very thin credentials for his chair and tenure at University of Colorado. Taylor also noted that UofC waived some normal requirements in the process, namely demanding a PhD. Now we know that the left&amp;rsquo;s favorite nut case obtained both tenure and chair of Ethnic Studies at University of Colorado by lying. He convinced UofC that the University of California system had offered him professorship in American Indian studies, causing Colorado to rush his tenure through.

Fortunately for the causes of freedom, liberty, justice, and common sense, the assembled lefties spend so much time decrying the vote count in Ohio and Michael Crichton&amp;rsquo;s book, they ran out of time to produce a strategy.

                Newsday.com: Bush Suggests Chirac Is &amp;lsquo;Good Cowboy&amp;rsquo;
In his first European trip since re-election, President Bush displays remarkable statemanship.
Balancing between firmness and friendliness, the President places American interest first, yet he undeniably wins friends on every stop.
Sometimes, timing is everything, and the President dares to admit such:
_&amp;ldquo;This is the first dinner since I&amp;rsquo;ve been re-elected on European soil, and it&amp;rsquo;s with Jacques Chirac. And that ought to say something.

   I am as pleased as anyone with Condoleezza Rices initial performance as Secretary of State. Shes a smart, articulate, passionate defender of America and George W. Bushs foreign policy vision. But all the excited talk about Condi for President is wildly premature, and even dangerous to the conservative cause.
 writes Steven M. Warshawsky on The American Thinker, February 15. Mr. Warshawsky goes on to list some pretty predictable problems with Condoleezza Rices White House credentials:

Usually, these stories garner only a &amp;ldquo;whatever&amp;rdquo; from me. Not sure why this one has me thinking about my kids and parents and wife. It does. Avian flu outbreaks in Vietnam bird populations threaten to spread across the world. This could be the worst pandemic since 1918. Worse than that even, since 72% of those diagnosed with this nasty virus &amp;ndash; die.
 The H5N1 avian flu, which first appeared in Hong Kong in 1997 and has since popped up twice, is evolving and can jump directly from birds to people, killing an estimated 72 percent of diagnosed victims, Gerberding said.

And in more than ten years of helping companies embrace the internet and new technology, I can assure you that a front-to-back Microsoft solution is the least expensive possible.

                Dean&amp;rsquo;s World  noticed that a Howard Dean support threw a shoe at Richard Perle when Perle began speaking at debate against Howard in Oregon yesterday.
Joe Gandelman, guest blogger, asks several questions about the mental state of the person who threw the shoe. But this is typical Deaniac behavior. Its why Dr. Dean wanted no press at the affair. His side has nothing to say, save for we have more shoes than we need, so you take some.

                The New York Times print edition has a delightful story about the new friendship between George Bush 41 and Bill Clinton.
Some of was pretty harsh on Clinton during his presidency, and Im certainly in that group. But a friendship between the presidents father and predecessor is good for everyone.
George H. W. Bush, a terrible politician and so-so leader, is a wonderful human being. Bill Clinton is a man of no real political convictions, endless charm, and endearing wit.

A 25-year-old man is predicted to receive a 0.82 percent rate of return on his Social Security taxes.2 Low-income workers have extremely poor rates of return, and many low-income men will receive less in benefits than they paid in Social Security payroll taxes.

My guess is that The Tulsa World&amp;lsquo;s tactic of denying bloggers the privilege of linking to stories will become widespread.

                The hamburger giant, McDonald&amp;rsquo;s, sued two lefty idiot activists in England for libel after the pair distributed pamphlets accusing McDonalds of starving the Third World, deforestation, and killing people with poisonous food. McDonald&amp;rsquo;s won the libel suit.
But wait . . . liberals don&amp;rsquo;t lose in courts in Europe. So the wackjobs&amp;ndash;Helen Steel and David Morris&amp;ndash;appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in, where else, France. That court ruled against Britain for failing to provide the couple with massive, expensive legal assistance.

                John Kerry tried to make a campaign issue out of the flu vaccine shortage. It didn&amp;rsquo;t work, but he tried. So did other senior Democrats.
Today we learn that flu shots may not prolong lives among the elderly.
   Led by National Institutes of Health researchers, the study challenges standard government dogma and is bound to confuse senior citizens. During last fall&amp;rsquo;s flu vaccine shortage, thousands of older Americans, heeding the government&amp;rsquo;s public health message, stood in long lines to get their shots.

                Michelle Malkin has a nice roundup of blogs and MSM stories on the UN sex scandal. Thanks much, Michelle, for the plug.
Some stories hit me harder than others, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been anti-UN for about 20 years. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post a few lines that wrote in my 1993 book, The Conservative Manifesto:
   Since there is little evidence to defend the United Nations as anything but a hindrance to the cause of democracy and the advance of American foreign policy, we will withdraw from the United Nations and expel it from our borders.

                I would love to do a study on the lifetime achievement of Rockwood School District.
The district covers far west St. Louis County, Missouri, and touts itself as one of the best school districts in the nation. Based on standardized scores, they have every right.
But Rockwood has some problems, too, and some of those problems have or will become societal problems.
Rockwood, it seems, prefers dealing with the highly intelligent, well-behaved children of very rich Wildwood folks.

                Want to know how Howard Dean thinks?
   I support allotting a certain percentage of seats in these elections for the Sunnis.
 Ponder that a moment.
The man who wanted to be chief executive of the modern world&amp;rsquo;s first democratic republic wrote on January 10, 2005, that he believes Iraqis deserve some sort of managed democracy in which votes are only marginally important.
Instead of letting the people, who can&amp;rsquo;t be trusted in Dean&amp;rsquo;s view, to decide affairs, Dean would have a team of fairness experts decide how to apportion seats in the Iraqi legislature.

                Over at Left2Right, Don Herzog claims that conservatives worship at the alter of &amp;ldquo;strict construction&amp;rdquo; of Constitutional matters.
   Strict construction means applying the language of the Constitution to what it straightforwardly refers to, not  here&amp;rsquo;s the connection  using it as a springboard to make stuff up.
 You&amp;rsquo;re wrong from the get-go, Don. Conservatives don&amp;rsquo;t honor strict constructionalism. We insist on original understanding.
Put simply, the framers of laws have one chance to get their meaning across in writing.

                About two months ago, right around Christmas, a silly little girl who attends some college somewhere in Pennsylvania sent me a nasty, mean e-mail. She had read something I wrote about the United Nations. Her college indoctrinators had convinced her that the only to achieve anything close to justice in the world is to dissolve all governments save for the the UN.
Well, little girl who was too shy to pen her name, if you sawABC&amp;rsquo;s 20/20 tonight, you learned a little about that wonderful institution.

I heard about it, followed the stories, and read the blogs. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like commenting here. The reason was that the story was obvious. Senior executives in the mainstream media believe that conservatives are Bible-beating idiots, Republicans raped poor black women so they can later eat the off-spring, and soldiers are murderers who enlist so they can kill without repercusion. Sorry, folks, but that&amp;rsquo;s how MSM, most college professors, a good major of the population of New York City, and Eason Jordan view us.

Ward Churchill has two choices: resign from CU and go to work for some leftwing think-tank that doesn&amp;rsquo;t care how much he lies on his resume, or move subtlely to the right.

                In an interview with USA Today, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the once and future president of Iran, said the US and Iran have more common ground than differences. Running for a return to the Iranian presidency, Rafsanjani was clearly speaking to the White House through the press.
If he&amp;rsquo;s sincere and he returns to power, this could be a major victory for Bush&amp;rsquo;s foreign policy in the Middle East. Bringing a moderate or liberal government to Iran is not Rafsanjani&amp;rsquo;s goal, for sure, but, like Gorbechev found in the Soviet Union, any reform could spin out of control.

                of the DNC Chair.
   (CNN) &amp;ndash; Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean appears to have virtually locked up the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, after his last major challenger dropped out of the race and endorsed him Friday night.
  Veteran party activist Donnie Fowler, who had been positioning himself as the alternative candidate to Dean, said it was &amp;ldquo;clear&amp;rdquo; Dean had the votes to become the new chairman when DNC members vote next week.

 I must say this is good news. An indictment by a US grand jury is one of only two ways to get to the bottom of the scam, and the only hope for putting the criminals behind bars.

According to administration sources speaking on condition of anonymity, the new tactics include ordering expensive pizzas for delivery to senior Bush administration officials&amp;rsquo; homes, making crank phone calls to American military high command at all hours of the night, and sending spam e-mails to American troops promising millions of dollars working from home&amp;ndash;all attempts to degrade morale.

   Investigators probing alleged corruption at the United Nations oil-for-food program are scrutinizing thousands of pages of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan&amp;rsquo;s documents, including e-mail and phone records, to determine whether he exerted influence in securing a contract for a Swiss company that employed his son.
 Previously, Volcker&amp;rsquo;s team had cleared the elder Annan of wrong-doing in connection with the scam which diverted billlions of dollars intended to releive the suffering of poor Iraqis into the pockets of Saddam Hussein and his sons.

   All kinds of books came out post-911 that clearly laid out the fact that terrorists seek high body counts. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the bodies are you, your wife, your newborn kid, your grandmother, Jews, Christians, atheists or Muslims who are unlucky enough to be in the target area.

I understand his points about the protections Churchill has built up over time: tenure, government employee, etc. As an originalist, I don&amp;rsquo;t buy the government employee protection because I don&amp;rsquo;t buy the conduit of the 14th Amendment argument. Further, firing him is not the same as incarcerating him. The state of Colorado is under no Constitutional or moral obligation to continue the employment of any person it deems detrimental to the state&amp;rsquo;s welfare.

While many Republicans cant wait for Dr. Dean to take his seat at the head of the opposition table, I am a little cautious.

Well, they didn&amp;rsquo;t claim that, exactly, but if the BBC can irresponsibly hyperbolize facts in order to promoted its twisted, anti-Western, pro-terrorist viewpoints, why can&amp;rsquo;t we?

                Terrorists used a disabled child as a suicide bomber on election day, Iraqi interior minister Falah al-Naqib said today.
    In all, 44 people were killed in a total of 38 bomb attacks on polling stations. Police at the scene of one the Baghdad blasts said the bomber appeared to have Down&amp;rsquo;s syndrome.
    Mr Al-Naqib praised an Iraqi citizen who was killed while preventing one suicide bomber from reaching a crowd of people outside a polling station.

Rice came into the world during segregation in a segregated Alabama. Unlike Madelaine Albright, who discovered she was Jewish when a Jew in the cabinet migh help her president, Secretary Rice has known her life that she&amp;rsquo;s black. In Alabama as a girl, society didn&amp;rsquo;t let you forget.
Ms. Rice follows another African-American in the highest cabinet post of the most powerful country in the world.

While Senators have used the word liar occasionally, those occasions have been rare. At one time, the word demanded censure or a duel. These days, coming from members of Bill Clinton&amp;rsquo;s party, one must assume &amp;ldquo;liar&amp;rdquo; is some sort of underhanded praise.
Condoleezza Rice&amp;rsquo;s confirmation is already in the books. She will receive more than 2/3 of the Senate&amp;rsquo;s endorsement.

                My mom worked evenings at St. Mary&amp;rsquo;s Hospital starting when I was in fourth grade. My dad went to be about 8:30 or 9:00 every evening, so, with no supervision, I started watching &amp;ldquo;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&amp;rdquo; before my time. I was addicted.
Johnny Carson was a giant of Americana from the 1960s through 1992. He dominated the late night airwaves in a way no one else ever will.

                The hosting provider I have used since May of last year was unabled to provide even minimal levels of service over the past month. As a result, the owner of that company decided to end its hosting business. Coincidentally, I saw his notice of termination while I was e-mailing him to let him know that I&amp;rsquo;d given up on his company&amp;rsquo;s ability to provide web hosting service.
Last night and tonight, I moved four large applications from the old provider to the new one, WebHost4Life.

Armstrong says his brother is a good conservative who could not hope to win running as a Republican in that district. Good for Kent and for the people of his district. Party affiliation isn&amp;rsquo;t as important as core beliefs, and Kent Williams&amp;rsquo;s core seems as solid as a rock.

You want to present three dropdownlists&amp;ndash;one for each set of data. When I select a Customer from list A, list is rebuilt with Orders for that customer, the first order is selected, and list C is updated with the Products for that order, the first Product selected.
Using ASP.NET postbacks is pretty straightforward, but it&amp;rsquo;s also pretty ugly. Al Alberto got us most of the way to a solution with this article on CodeProject.

While the Rams have done much to deserve criticism this season, Snow was right in two ways.

Irrelevant.
That word comes up again and again, but in Crichtons text and in the readers mind. While reading State of Fear, I found myself using that term, boldly, even rudely, in numerous conversations and arguments. So much of what the left says is irrelevant.

Biggest Boom: The United States economy. While EU countries trudge along with 10% unemployment and flat growth, the United States has begun a fundamentally solid and sustainable rally that will continue for another 4 years.

                Time Magazine&amp;rsquo;s Man of the Year title often makes a mockery of the honor. Remember the PC?
This year, though, Time&amp;rsquo;s editors got it right. Tempted, no doubt, to embarrass their political enemy, the editors took the high road by selecting George W. Bush, the most remarkable President in half a century, as its Man of the Year, 2004.
   For sticking to his guns (literally and figuratively), for reshaping the rules of politics to fit his ten-gallon-hat leadership style and for persuading a majority of voters that he deserved to be in the White House for another four years, George W.

                Last week, I came across the news story about 12 homes under construction set ablaze in Maryland and used it to discuss eco-terrorism. Yesterday, authorities arrested a man named Aaron Speed. He is not known as an eco-terrorist, and apparently had no motive. Speeds works as a security guard protecting the home allegedly torched.
Something seems wrong here. While Speed has a history of mental illness, he reminds me of the guy they arrested in Atlanta for detonating a bomb during the Olympics.

                I live in Wildwood, Missouri, where traffic light cameras are popping up at all the intersections where new traffic signals are installed. It seems a new traffic signal is installed every week, too.
I heard Walter Williams talking last year about these devices increasing the number of accidents and the number fatal accidents at intersections where they&amp;rsquo;re installed.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the reason:
  The cameras aren&amp;rsquo;t cheap, but the manufacturers sell the city council on the ROI.

I agree with much of what Ron writes, but why are Democrats so godawful afraid to say &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re Americans?&amp;rdquo;
Bilancia catches most of the keys to the 1980 team&amp;rsquo;s success: brilliant coach, team play, focus, creativity, hard work, working for something outside yourself, and staying on the offensive.

I have vacillated on the death penalty for several years, beginning with witnessing the implosion of the old St. Louis Arena. (Long story.) But let&amp;rsquo;s give credit where it&amp;rsquo;s due: the death penalty itself.
Never having been a proponent of the deterrent of the death penalty, I have maintained that capital punishment can be defended on two grounds:

First, the story has grabbed me. The action begins quickly. While some reviewers have crticized the number of characters and the variety of venues, I find the pace excellent.
Second, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for massive debunking of wacko global warming theories, the book will start slowly.

                Thanks to Joe Gandelman writing on Dean&amp;rsquo;s World, I just read George Will&amp;rsquo;s attempt at restoring sanity to liberalism and its party, the DNC. In this analysis, Will blames the stockpiling losses on liberalsm&amp;rsquo;s condescension, disrespect, and distrust of most Americans.
Will uses as an example a quote from Robert Kuttner writing in the leftist American Prospect:
        &amp;ldquo;Bill Clinton won election by declaring, as a matter of values, that people who work hard and play by the rules should not be poor.

I needed smokes and a coffee, so I drove to the nearby Mobil On the Run. As I emerged from the store, a beautiful woman with eyes like a Scandinavian model approached my left flank turned me, and planted a kiss that sent my mind swirling in confused happiness.

                Professor Bainbridge quotes at length an essay by Andrew Bacevich in today&amp;rsquo;s Wall Street Journal which concludes a) we are over-extended in Iraq and Afghanistan, and b) Bush&amp;rsquo;s choices are &amp;ldquo;stark&amp;rdquo;. Those choice are: bring the troops home and use &amp;ldquo;other means&amp;rdquo; to battle terrorism, or grow the Army. Professor Bainbridge would be willing to raise taxes to build an 18 division Army.
If we are over-extended, and we might not be yet, I think there is a third option.

                I dont know what gets the blamepolitical correctness, pop culture, declining understanding of the subtleties of language, or just timebut I miss some words. I wish people used them more often.
Spatand the past of other verbs that end with -it. Instead of spat, I hear only spit used for any tense. He spat on me, lends an air of dignity that he spit on me lacks.
Spittleanother victim of the ubiquitous verb.

One point I&amp;rsquo;d add: The reason American people are outraged over Clinton&amp;rsquo;s failure to take out Bin Laden in 1998 and 1999 is that they don&amp;rsquo;t know. The press did a fine job of filtering out any criticism of the Clinton admin.
Remember Howard Fineman&amp;rsquo;s admission in October? That the MSM would report only bad news about Iraq until the end of the campaign?

                Back in December 2003, I blogged my predictions for 2004, Part I and Part II. Later, I added my 2004 resolutions. Lets see how I did. (My 20/20 hindsight is** in bold**.)
PREDICTIONS:
Economy
The US economy will continue to expand at the fast pace since the Reagan administration through the second quarter. While new home construction will slow, service and other sectors will more than take its place. Unemployment will improve in fits and starts, but it will be more than half a percentage point lower by the end of the second quarter as the economy creates 100,000 more jobs than existed at the peak in April 2000.

                The Wall Street Journal is out with its top ten trends. (You may need to subscribe to WSJonline. I do, so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.) According to my favorite daily, here&amp;rsquo;s what to expect in ten industries:
Fashion: Plain is out; vibrant is in.
Autos: Uncertainty. The SUV craze is waning, but nothing seems to fill the void. In my opinion, hybrids, especially big ones, may become de rigeur.
Publishing: Fewer reads, more material will lead publishers to jump on some craze, like the spiritualism of the 90s or journaling/letters of last year.

Perhaps he should learn about the mass graves in Kurdish north. Perhaps he should be lifting weights instead of holding idiotic signs that make him look like a pansy.

                Kofi Annan&amp;rsquo;s tenure as UN Secretary-General ranks as one of the most massive failings in modern leadership. Two American presidents and hundreds of thousands of American troops filled the void left by Annan&amp;rsquo;s abrogation of responsibility. In case you&amp;rsquo;ve missed the headlines, Kofi Annan presided over the slaughter of nearly one million people in Rwanda, the enslavement and systematic murders of millions in Sudan, the rise to emminence of Islamic terrorists, Saddam Hussein&amp;rsquo;s theft of billions, and the orchestrated attempt to eliminate Israel.

My point: there may be rational moral arguments against corporations, but they are as pointless as moral arguments against thinking bad thoughts.

I could go on, but you get the point.

                American military policy as most of us know it evolved in response to the Cold War. The Soviet Union represented a military commanders worst nightmare: equal or superior strength in numbers, technology, and intelligence, combined with a desire to conquer the world.
But, as we found in the 1990s, the Soviet Union was also a military commanders dream: a formidable adversary requiring American and NATO vigilance in the forms of large, new weapons systems, enormous training budgets, and hands-off intelligence programs.

                Jimmy Carter will probably attend Yassir Arafat&amp;rsquo;s funeral service in Cairo, Egypt. How typical of the man who considers the American Revolution a low point in world history.
Yassir Arafat was a tyrant, a murderer, a thief, a shameless self-promoter, a liar, a welcher whose ego killed more Palestinians than all of Israel&amp;rsquo;s weapons. While the UN and its amen chorus denounced Israel&amp;rsquo;s terrorism fence and the poverty Israel supposedly forced upon the Palestinians, Arafat moved hundreds of million of dollars to France&amp;ndash;money that might have alleviated Palestinian suffering.

                It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that the liberal MSM would smear John Ashcroft in his retirement as they&amp;rsquo;ve smeared him throughout his career. But Newsweek&amp;rsquo;s coverage of Ashcroft is over the top. Their lead story, Ashcroft&amp;rsquo;s legacy, is an interview with a single person, David Cole, who has a toolshedfull of axes to grind with the outgoing Attorney General.
While liberals always have and always will hate Ashcroft, make up stories about him, accuse him of everything from fascism to the Johnstown Flood, this treatment is beyond the pale.

                According to posters to liberal forums, conservatives have a monopoly on violence. But some young Democrats, it seems, have learned their lessons from the union thugs who destroyed numerous Bush-Cheney and Republican offices prior to the election.
Three high school seniors who supported Kerry beat a Bush supporter with baseball bat and chains after school yesterday.
The SAINT PAUL PIONEER PRESS reported in morning editions: The argument began earlier in the day Thursday with a discussion about candidates the minors had supported for president, Backstrom said.

At the time, John Ashcroft was Missouri&amp;rsquo;s Attorney-General who was seeking to replace Kit Bond as Governor.
As we slithered between preppily dressed bodies in the once glamorous hotel, a shout came from up ahead, repeated in various voices of shock and amazement.

Nod to INDC Journal.
Goldberg makes a point that I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to make since Phil Collins was just Genesis&amp;rsquo;s drummer:
   What Maher, Raines, and Smiley fail to grasp is that all morality is based upon transcendence &amp;ndash; or it is merely based on utilitarianism of one kind or another, and therefore it is not morality so much as, at best, an enlightened expediency or will-to-power.

                Arguing with Sign Posts reminds me that liberals continue to say things that seem, well, silly. But some liberals are teetering frightening close to the truth.
Someone posting to the democraticunderground.org forum ponders whether it&amp;rsquo;s time for liberals to stop supporting our troops. Her reasoning goes thusly: George Bush is a known evil; those who support Bush support evil; 72% of American service members in Iraq supported George Bush; therefore; 72% of American service member in Iraq are evil.

                George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s achievement in the election of 2004 ranks as one of the greatest political achievements of a century.
Elected without a popular vote mandate in a contested election that was unsettled for six weeks, Bush began his first term at a sharp disadvantage. Liberals hated him, lambasting him as a buffoon, an idiot, a redneck moron from West Texas who was too stupid to tie shoes, much less run a country.

 Everyone who voted for Bush is a toothless, SUV-driving, NASCAR-watching, illiterate who doesn&amp;rsquo;t deserve to vote America will become a 3rd world country Calling for boycotts of all American products by both Americans and everyone else in the world Begging Canada to annex the blue states.

I will call it. Bush has now won Nevada, New Mexico, Iowa, and Ohio. He has won the popular vote. George W. Bush has been re-elected to a second term as President of the United States by the will of its free citizens.

                John Kerry has apparently decided to contest the presidential election in the courts by forcing Ohio, to count its 150,000 provisional ballots. Should that fail, perhaps he&amp;rsquo;ll sue everyone who voted for Bush. If John Kerry forces a prolonged fight in Ohio, he will have assured himself an ignoble, despised place in American history.
In 2000, Al Gore had several factors on his side that somewhat supported his challenges:

Beginning with WSJ&amp;rsquo;s 216-203 Bush, I see the Toss Ups falling like this:
Bush 216 &#43; 63 = 279 (winner)
Kerry 203 &#43; 52 = 255 (loser)
Popular vote: Bush 50-Kerry 48-Nader/others &amp;lt;1.
Senate: GOP &#43; 4

Likely alternatiaves (in order of probability):
 Bush wins Florida Kerry wins Ohio Bush wins Pennsylvannia Kerry wins Minnesota Kerry wins Wisconsin Bush wins Michigan Kerry wins New Mexico Bush wins Hawaii

What could be more demonstrative of the Democrat intellectualism than these stories. They send sub-human union neanderthals to smash up Republican campaign offices because they&amp;rsquo;re afraid of losing on merit. Then again, isn&amp;rsquo;t the purpose of unionism to eliminate merit-based rewards?

Coupled with Howard Fineman&amp;rsquo;s assessment that the press has moral reasons to bury news that might help Bush, the conspiracy of the MSM against the president is more or less conceded by the conspirators themselves. Does anyone care?

                I didn&amp;rsquo;t see or hear the debate. Instead, I read bloggers&amp;rsquo; reactions this morning. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I found:
Instapundit&amp;rsquo;s concensus reading is the Bush won by fighting to a draw. After the president&amp;rsquo;s miserable performance in debate one, this makes some sense.
Andrew Sullivan called it a draw.
Dean&amp;rsquo;s World reviewers took the president.
The Corner, though, is the interesting one. Based on the times of the posts, I&amp;rsquo;d say that Bush was miserable for first 40 minutes or so.

No, Mr. Fineman, the President doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound desperate. He sounds like a candidate. He sounds full-throated and eager. His pathetic performance in debate one&amp;ndash;so reminiscent of his dad&amp;rsquo;s in debate 2 in 1992&amp;ndash;woke him.

                In this front page NYTimes.com story, the paper argues that Democrats are pummelling Republicans in registering new voters in swing states, specifically, Florida and Ohio. Looking at the headline, one might conclude that Kerry is gaining momentum. If you read more, then do a little independent work, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to reach a different conclusion.
Okay, so the Democrats are better at getting people to register. No doubt. In St. Louis, Missouri, the Democrat machine is canvassing cemetaries all weekend.

                While only 8% of Republics are ashamed of their jobs. What other conclusion can we draw from the fact that, according to OpenSecrets.org, 1 in 4 donors to John Kerry&amp;rsquo;s campaign refuses to disclose his employer or occupation while 92% of Bush contributors proudly disclose theirs.
Under federal law, candidates and parties are required to make reasonable efforts to determine the occupation and employer of all contributors. While Republicans are frequently fined by the FEC for failing to identify the occupuations of 5-10% of donors, Democrats generally skate by with 15% non-disclosure with no fines.

About the same time, some liberal mags were speculating that al Qaeda&amp;rsquo;s capacity to carry out spectacular acts of terrorism has been so greatly diminished that the Bush administration is being disingenuous by even mentioning the terrorism threat as a real risk.

                Thanks to Poliblogger for this link.
There is something chilling in reading this article top to bottom, perhaps more so because 1972 is the beginning of my political awakening.
My parents were naturally Democrats, and I grew up in the very Democrat, blue-collar neighborhood of Southwest St. Louis where Scullin Steel once cast a sulfur cloud shadow over the old frame houses built in the declining days of the Jazz Age.

Well, consider the source. John Kerry believes that the world was a better place when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan. John Kerry believes that Iraq was a better place when Saddam was presiding over the murders of 300,000 people and the tortures of 5,000,000 and the enslavement of the nation.

                The Bush administration violated several of my rules of war in Iraq:
 Do not let politicians make military decisions; do not let generals make political decisions.  Tommy Franks has admitted that the declaration of the end of major combat operations was his idea. He hoped that by convincing President Bush to make that public declaration, our former &amp;ldquo;allies&amp;rdquo; would jump in to help rebuild Iraq. As a result, we stopped aggressive fighting before we had killed enough enemy.

                One thing we&amp;rsquo;ve learned from the CBS Memogate unraveling: if you need to get in touch with the Kerry Campaign, call CBS News.
CBS has admitted that its producer, Mary Mapes, arranged for a telephone conversation between Bill Burkett, source of the infamous memos, and Joe Lockhart, senior advisor to Senator Kerry and former Clinton press secretary.
According to USA Today new ethics experts, the contacts raise serious ethics questions, pointing to the possibility that CBS is using its power as a major television news network to influence the outcome of the Presidential election according to its liberal bias.

 One year suspension of credentials to all federal government offices and events. Ban CBS from the presidential debates this fall.  These steps will ensure that the reorganized CBS News staff place objectivity and ethics before party politics and sensationalism.

On Saturday, Burkett says he provided &amp;ldquo;information&amp;rdquo; on Bush&amp;rsquo;s National Guard record to the Kerry campaign via former Sentator Max Cleland.  While Burkett did not specify what that information was, it is clear that it included the forged memos that, eventually, found their way to CBS and Dan Rather.

The Gallup poll was conducted normally. The Pew people tried something new, by conducting the poll in two phases. Whether that accounts for the difference, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but somebody is wrong here.

Shortly, we&amp;rsquo;ll introduce contests for Pick the Time and Date, Pick the Method, and Write Dan&amp;rsquo;s Suicide Note which we&amp;rsquo;ll have certified as authentic by CBS&amp;rsquo;s own Marcel Matley.

                I watched the CBS Evening News tonight, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the competition. NBC and ABC were unable to find a single forensic document specialist who believe the documents on CBS News were legitimate. These included former FBI document experts now teaching forensics at universities.
Apparently, the only expert who thinks Jerry Killian typed and signed the CBS papers is the CBS employee featured on their broadcast tonight.
Funny&amp;ndash;the liberal press isn&amp;rsquo;t rallying to CBS&amp;rsquo;s side.

                Yesterday, I conjectured that Dan Rather fabricated the Bush ANG documents as a vendetta against the Bushes for 41&amp;rsquo;s undressing of Rather on the CBS Evening News in 1988&amp;ndash;the interview that turned the election in Bush&amp;rsquo;s favor. Apparently, I&amp;rsquo;m not alone. Here&amp;rsquo;s an interesting quote from Powerline:
 Last night, it was reported that senior executives at CBS News were promising an investigation. Today, Dan Rather is personally vouching for the documents&amp;rsquo; authenticity.

                Something on TimeIsAFactor.com caught my attention.
One of the 4 CBS memos about George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s National Guard service contains the following memo supposedly authored by his commanding officer:
&amp;ldquo;Bush wasn&amp;rsquo;t here during rating period and I don&amp;rsquo;t have any feedback from 187th in Alabama. I will not rate.&amp;rdquo;
Having spent 9 years as an enlisted Personnel Officer in the Navy, the marks on Bush&amp;rsquo;s fitness report for the period he was in Alabama are the only ones that could be entered.

                On the CBS Evening News tonight, Dan Rather lied about the reasons for questioning the authenticity of the National Guard documents he likely typed at home before cutting and pasting a dead man&amp;rsquo;s signature.
He claimed that doubters asserted that the CGTimes font &amp;ldquo;was not available&amp;rdquo; in the 1970s. No, Dan, no one&amp;rsquo;s claiming that. Typography experts are claiming, though, that the proportional font was not available on common typewriters in 1972.

CBS News has launched an internal investigation into the validity of documents related to George W. Bush&amp;rsquo;s National Guard service that it aired on 60 Minutes, according to Drudge. Other developments overnight seem to make it more likely than not that at least two of the documents were forgeries&amp;ndash;with Killian&amp;rsquo;s signature electronically placed on a memo fabricated by Democrat operatives, then fed to CBS News.

I am very familiar with the typewriter the Navy used in the 1980s: IBM Selectric III. It had changable font golfballs, one of which was proportional (CGTimes). But it looked awful. The proportional spacing was in consistent.

 The new records are consistent with the President&amp;rsquo;s long-standing assertion that he trained regularly until 1972 when transfered to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign.

CNN: Buried on politics page
MSNBC: Buried on politics page
Why do I single out these two? Because CNN and Time own a joint website, as do MSNBC and Newsweek. Basically, CNN and NBC refuse to report the results of their own polls because, like spoiled, petulant children, the polls don&amp;rsquo;t show what they want them to show.

Great convention; best since 1984. In fact, this whole election is starting to feel like 1984. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope. Kerry is desperate. Not sounding so. Is.
George Bush, for the first time ever, looked completely comfortable speaking to a large audience. He looked at home.

                I don&amp;rsquo;t confuse George H. W. Bush with a great president. I do believe he has been and remains a truly great American, though. His performance as the former president father of the president has been superb&amp;ndash;no one could ask for a better performance.
And his performance yesterday in defense of the President and in opposition to the President&amp;rsquo;s filthy detractors was stellar.

                Professor Bainbridge has discovered another example of liberal hypocrisy. (They&amp;rsquo;re so hard to find, aren&amp;rsquo;t they?)
Amazon has suspended its rules of decorum for one book: Unfit for Command. The Amazon policy permits anyone to write anything about anyone&amp;ndash;short of profanity. Presumably, one can offer cash money for the assassination of the Swift Boat Veterans with Amazon&amp;rsquo;s ascent.

                According to the New York Times, the people in New York to stiffle Republic speech, to disrupt the Republican convention, and to increase the chances of harm being done to the Republican President, are making life difficult for both delegates and for NY police.
I think back to Republican demonstrations in Florida during the 2000 recount. Remember how the major media and every liberal across this great land clamored for harsh punishment for the Republicans?

Arnold, whom I laughed at when he announced his run for governor in California, is doing something no career politician could. He is doing what Reagan did in 1976. He is winning the convention.
Following on Monday&amp;rsquo;s performances, this is the most genuinely positive, upbeat GOP convention of my lifetime with the possible exception of 1984, when David Brinkley said of the conventioneers, &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re all so happy that can hardly stand it.

USA Today July 26, 2000:
 [T]he contrast with Texas Gov. Bush could hardly be sharper. From the beginning, Bush has relied on a hometown trio: chief strategist Karl Rove, campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and communications director Karen Hughes. Despite little experience in presidential campaigns, they have moved through this year&amp;rsquo;s difficult GOP primaries and into the general election winning credit, by and large, for being sure-footed and tight-lipped.

                Howard Fineman used his blog to spin for Kerry today. If I had any money, I&amp;rsquo;d offer a reward to the first person to find this quote pertaining to Al Gore. Speaking of Kerry, Fineman writes:
   &amp;ldquo;He is fundamentally a loner and a thoughtful decision-maker &amp;ndash;sometimes too much so, which the Bush campaign translates as &amp;ldquo;uncertainty.&amp;rdquo; &amp;quot;

(I have not trusted him since his attacks on Pat Buchanan in which McCain knowingly advanced phony charges that Buchanan was a Nazi sympathizer. McCain did so for his own purposes and permanently destroy my faith in his character.)
Apparently, though, there are quite a few people who have reservations about the one of the Keating Five who never seems to get a mention with that group.

                The most pro-violent, anti-American, anti-Western protests since the 1970s has begun in New York. The protesters are there to wish death to the President of the United States and all support or tolerate him. Yet protesters, whose web pages and speeches are filled with violent, murderous mayhem, won&amp;rsquo;t do the deed themselves. While talking a good game, these unemployed, over-educated, unbathed, nasty excuses for human beings are, in fact, cowards. They confront their enemies only in large numbers and with the protection of police, whom they claim to despise.

                This letter, published in NRO, is from an officer who was onboard the swiftboat the night of December 2-3, 1968 when Kerry claims to have been wounded under fire.
This letter is significant because Kerry&amp;rsquo;s defenders have claimed since the outset that none of the SwiftVets ever served onboard Kerry&amp;rsquo;s boat. The author of this letter was the Officer in Charge of the swiftboat that night&amp;ndash;Kerry&amp;rsquo;s senior officer who would have had to have signed the award recommendation.

Of course, these mice of science lack any actual numbers. Were they to study their own fields, they&amp;rsquo;d learn that the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 released approxomately 11 cubic miles of dust into the atmosphere, creating a mini-nuclear winter in New York, some 6,000 miles away.

                Jim Lacey, in National Review Online, makes some excellent points about the same thing I&amp;rsquo;ve wondered for some time: where are all the terrorists?
After we invaded Afghanistan, we were told that tens of thousands of well-trained fanatics were scattered around the globe, increasing their danger and allowing them to recruit more members.
Well, three years later, where are they? Why haven&amp;rsquo;t they struck?
Mr. Lacey&amp;rsquo;s article is well worth reading as explores some possible answers to these questions.

Dear Senator Kerry,
We are pleased to welcome your campaign representatives to Texas today. We honor all our veterans, all whom have worn the uniform and served our country.

                Everyone knows that John F. Kerry refuses to allow anyone to view any part of his official military records. The Truth Laid Bear blog has found another Kerry cover-up: his contributors list.
Even though federal election law requires that candidates for all public office publicize their contributor list and how much each contributor gives, Kerry considers himself above the law. Bush, whose military records are public record, lists almost 100% of his contributors, while Kerry&amp;rsquo;s disclosure rate is in the mere 70s.

A logical person&amp;ndash;a professor of philosophy, let&amp;rsquo;s say, or math&amp;ndash;mush cringe trying to defend Kerry&amp;rsquo;s arguments that his service in Vietnam makes him more deserving of the office of the President of the United States than its current occupant. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:
Kerry and most Democrats consider the US to be the bad guys in Vietnam, and the US military the perpetrators of wrong for the advance of evil.

I had no idea that they would do something as stupid as waste an entire Sunday trying to convince people that George W. Bush ghost-wrote the SwiftVets book, but that&amp;rsquo;s just what they did.
Stupid, stupid Democrats. You were winning this one, you morons! Instead of being &amp;ldquo;presidential&amp;rdquo; and adult about it by having Kerry merely respond, &amp;ldquo;My record in the Navy is my record in the Navy,&amp;rdquo; you send out drooling attack dogs like Tad Divine to lie about Bush&amp;rsquo;s personal involvement.

                A powerful union allowed to run amok in the St. Louis area&amp;rsquo;s fire protection district has made a lot of firefighters rich. It&amp;rsquo;s a little frustrating that the firemen in the safest districts seem to make the most money. It&amp;rsquo;s more alarming that a district that was better paid than any area union district unionized last year. That will only drive up the cost of fire protection for everyone. As with so many unions, expect this story in the St.

Hey, amateur politicians: Never give your opponent the opportunity to take a stand in defense of himself, his family, or his military service.
Kerry got no bounce from the DNC convention, but he will get 10 points from the swiftvets by this time next week. Bush will be down 12 when the GOP convention begins thanks to amateur political hacks who thought they could help their candidate.

                Okay, this is simple enough for even John Kerry and Howard Dean supporters to understand: American service members are safer serving in Iraq than they are in the US.
The US mortality rate, according to the Centers for Disease Control, is 834 deaths per 100,000 of population per year. There have been 200,000 (average) US troops in Iraq for 18 months. The death rate for 200,000 Americans should be 1,668 per year, meaning that since the start of the war, statistically you&amp;rsquo;d expect 2,502 Americans to have died.

                Last night was a big test. I passed, but there were a few anxious moments.
I took Angela to dinner at a fairly new, popular restaurant in Lafayette Square. Eleven Eleven Mississippi is modeled off of Northern California&amp;rsquo;s wine country bistros. It&amp;rsquo;s menu is excellent. It&amp;rsquo;s wine selection perfect. It&amp;rsquo;s prices reasonable.
This was the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve been &amp;ldquo;out&amp;rdquo; since quitting. My first smoke pangs occured just as we finished dinner.

                A union is trying to organize Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s programmers. The union is exploiting fear of off shoring to rally the workers.
Having worked in software engineering for a decade, but observed the utility of unions over 40 years, I strongly urge Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s employees to do some long, hard thinking before they sign up with the labor group.
Unions have been completely unable to stop off shoring in every industry they&amp;rsquo;ve tried. In fact, in steel, garments, and shoes, union activity accelerated the rates of job moves to overseas companies by making American workers more of a headache and more expensive.

Not having been on the stage since childhood (&amp;ldquo;Smallest Princess&amp;rdquo;, The King and I), I cannot speak to that, but I can try to describe the width and breadth of my pride in having been in on the labor and birth of such an awesome production.

                Make-up, lights, set, rehearsal, house: stage. Words that convey things to those with theatre in their blood and things very different to the rest of the world.
Friday night before the curtain felt like an opening. I was nervous. I thought back to my first play at DB: Blythe Spirit. In my first scene my character sipped a martini. On opening night, I was so nervous that the water&amp;rsquo;s surface looked like what I what later see from the bridge of a submarine: rolling waves breaking into white caps.

Last night, after the thrill of a wonderful opering night, still buzzing from the excitement and the energy of the play, I found out that my haste in producing the program resulted in my omitting one of my best friend&amp;rsquo;s biography.

I THINK this is accurate information, but I heard that we started a few minutes late because we still had a line out the door for tickets at 7:30. (?)

                One seminal moment can so focus the mind that the thing that should be central slides to the periphery.
Mr. L surprised me with &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s say a prayer.&amp;rdquo;
Instantly, I remembered the routine practiced by every Catholic sports team, speech club, and theatre cast and crew before any important event: hands lain upon hand, bodies pressed against bodies, some stretching to reach, others bowing to accommodate. All together for one moment, humbly before God and man, asking for His blessing on what we are about to do.

Perhaps if the Senator wishes us to take him seriously as a presidential candidate, he should put down the mirror, stop kissing his VP nominee, and attend the terror assessment briefings offered by the White House.

                It&amp;rsquo;s really coming together. It&amp;rsquo;s a great thing to see. Thank you, everyone, for what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. You might be doing this for yourself, but your dedication is such a gift to all the rest of us who went into it for OURselves. There is nothing better than being a part of a great team, is there? There&amp;rsquo;s something masturbatory about individual accomplishments. Tonight reminded me of boot camp when the company finally gets the drill down: 82 boots strike the pavement as one.

We worked and re-worked that d*mn thing soo many times, but it helped sooo much!

Sitting on the floor, watching the others work, hearing Jim breathe a deeper, more coordinated life into characters, was a beautiful thing to observe. While we all know OUR motivations and worries, the director&amp;rsquo;s vision is the one that counts&amp;ndash;it turns isolated characters into related beings.

Now, Anna Quindlen, in the latest Newsweek online, has wrung her hands beyond the poor abilities of Madge in a Palmolive commercial to repair.
Quindlen is worried that these Republicans are too damn manly for the good of the country.

There number of new claims for unemployment benefits fell, last week, by 39,000 to a four-year low. Yet all of the liberal media buried the story. Why? Because good economic news hurts Kerry&amp;rsquo;s chances of election, and the primary goal of the major news media in the US is to get him elected.

Until rehearsals began, we spent so much time together. We rarely go out, nor do we entertain a lot. With five kids, those things are just out of the question.

Is it any surprise, really?

Let the story (that reinforces the press&amp;rsquo;s prejudices) fester for awhile. Finally, to maintian their own legitimacy, quietly leak the real story.

                Here&amp;rsquo;s something worth reading and pondering. 
Hat tip to Professor Bainbridge.
Too many Christians rely on the writings of modern scholars who, 200 years from now, may or may not be valid. We just don&amp;rsquo;t know. We do know, however, that Augustine and Aquinas remain valid. Trust the ancients for they have withstood the test of time.

Before you go crying about all the people we are killing in Iraq, bear in mind that your chances of dying in 2004 are much, much greater here than there. Iraq is obviously safer than the United States.

My guess is that this evening&amp;rsquo;s talk shows will host more than a few &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; pundits who will claim Saddam&amp;rsquo;s indictment of Bush proves Moore&amp;rsquo;s case&amp;ndash;that Bush is in fact a criminal.

Once upon a time, municipalities synchronized traffic signals so that a vehicle moving at or about the speed limit would be stopped by a red light very infrequently, usually once while on that particular road. Apparently, St. Louis County, Missouri has abandoned that practice.
Last night, I had to stop for 7 of 9 signals in a 4 mile stretch approaching my home.

                The 9th Circuit&amp;rsquo;s ruling held that the federal marijuana laws did not apply to medicinal use of marijuana in two specific cases. As you should know, the Constitution prohibits Congress from making laws on matters that lie outside its enumerated powers, which are very limited. One of those powers, though, known as the commerce clause, gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. The commerce clause has become the conduit for Congressional abuse of the states and of the people.

Just months ago, critics claimed that June 30 was a ridiculous date, that the Iraqis, being dark-skinned people who don&amp;rsquo;t speak English natively, would never be able to handle the responsibilities of self-governance with so little preparation.

For one week, we took the full measure of a great man who lived in our lifetimes: a man who strode across history&amp;rsquo;s plane with steps that challenged, but didn&amp;rsquo;t surpass, the founders. We needed to cry, to laugh, to reflect on a life well-lived. And we did.

                Reading reminders of the hatred for Ronald Reagan (now the most beloved former president in US history), offers a lesson for President Bush and the American people.
During his administration, Reagan repeatedly did what he felt was right or necessary at the expense of his personal and political popularity. He was truly hated in Europe and in American institutions of higher learning. Yet his confident and brave pursuit of good won both the political and the moral battles of the time and of history.

                Julia Smillie wonders if technology and blogging has doomed writers.
 Mediocre writing always had a following, even though it didn&amp;rsquo;t transcend eras. Good writing still sells and IS read, while bad writing sells and sits. When I first started trying to get published in the 1980s, I read The Writer and Writer&amp;rsquo;s Digest religiously. Almost every issue contained at least one column or article that said this exact same thing.

Almost Home, run by the Franciscan Sisters of St. Mary, provides teen mothers with the chance to make a better life for themselves and their children. In exchange for going to school, remaining free from drugs, establishing the norms of social achievement (job, daycare, financial assistance, child-rearing skills, etc.), the women and their babies have a safe, comfortable place to live, help with their children, etc.

I could see light fighting to enter around the great doors&amp;rsquo; edges. As I walked toward the light, the doors began to open slowly, admitting more light.

I am very rarely critical of anything National Review and its people do, but I have to criticize this conversation: no one cares. The world view NR and her readers and advocates as conservatives. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t separate Buchanan from Goldberg. And we conservative, including those of us who formerly wrote for NR on CompuServe, couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less.

His serious face, always looking a bit pained with concern, now expresses a sad displeasure for life itself. To make matters worse, Howard Dean, the child politician &amp;ndash; childlike in size, bearing, countenance, temperament, mentality, and world view &amp;ndash; has not only stolen Kerry&amp;rsquo;s media-given title of Man to Beat, he has now taken Kerry&amp;rsquo;s Biblical allusion: Job.

                Even more bizarre, or so it must have seemed to Senator Kerry, was the effect of the war, for which he voted. The more successful our campaign in Iraq, the less his fellow Democrats liked him. Had we lost the war, one assumes that the rank-and-file Democrats would have supported a warmonger candidate. But as our victory became apparent, the Dems fled to the two candidates who opposed the war in the first place: Dean and Clark.

Howard Dean potentially faces criminal charges for releasing secret security plans for the Yankee Nuclear Power plant after 9/11/01. He won&amp;rsquo;t release records of meetings from his 11 years as governor, but he&amp;rsquo;s pretty fast and loose with national security plans whose compromise could give terrorists the information they need to overcome that security.

Having re-read the article, I have a new perspective. (Hey, I&amp;rsquo;ve been celebrating the holidays, and the mind isn&amp;rsquo;t quite up to full speed.)

                I found this on Drudge. I offer a contrarian explanation, however. Perhaps the feminization of men&amp;ndash;mandatorily sitting to urinate in pre-schools, supporting Howard Dean&amp;ndash;is reducing the amount of testosterone men produce. I&amp;rsquo;d like to see a study that measures the sperm count in deficient men before and after a weekend movie marathon of The Godfather I and II, Patton, Braveheart, The Patriot (Mel Gibson&amp;rsquo;s), and Band of Brothers (all 10 episodes).

Combine the Yankee Power/Homeland Security issue with Dr. Dean&amp;rsquo;s secret energy policy meetings, and you begin to see that money talks with the good doctor, as does he from both sides of his mouth.
Also, have you noticed that the big magazines, Time and Newsweek, are starting to question the Dean phenomenon?

The Congregationalist Church is a Christian denomination that preaches a personal relationship with God without a strong hierarchal structure guiding it.

                Steve Moore of the Club for Growth has an excellent analysis of Howard Dean&amp;rsquo;s proposed tax increases. An excellent summary:
_The Dean plan, our ad notes, would raise taxes by $2,472 a year on a typical middle-income family of four. Mr. Dean would also raise the death tax rate, the capital gains tax rate, the dividend tax rate and the payroll tax, and he would bring back the hated marriage tax penalty that President Bush abolished this year.

                When Town Hall was in its infancy on CompuServe, and I was writing three columns a week, Jimmy Carter&amp;rsquo;s illegal negotiations with North Korea that resulted in US assistance in building nuclear weapons to be aimed at Los Angeles and Chicago inspired my most vitriolic pieces. What bothered me, perhaps, more than anything was the fact that Carter&amp;rsquo;s meddling had me siding with Clinton. That was 1994.
Ten years later, we are still digging out from that mess.

                It is easy to get young people riled up, as William F. Buckely points out. The Dean house parties, rallies, $2 donations, etc., are the kinds of things young people like to do. And there is no doubt that Dean has energized a particular demographic group, namely, the 18- to 24-year-old folk.
Last week, Dr. Dean warned the DNC chairman that, if the other Democrat candidates don&amp;rsquo;t stop attacking Dean, Dean&amp;rsquo;s supporters might not vote at all come November 2004.

                The New Year begins with&amp;ndash;guess what&amp;ndash;Howard Dean saying something stupid. Thankfully, John F**ing Kerry has called him on it.
Dean&amp;rsquo;s inability to research his statements before making them&amp;ndash;like finding out how Kerry voted&amp;ndash;makes you wonder what kind of a doctor he was. Did he prescribe medication before checking the patient&amp;rsquo;s allergies? Did he prescribe procedures without determining if that procedure remained the recommended treatment? In other words, was he as intellectually lazy as a physician as he is as a politician?

 I will leave my caps lock on 24x7x364, using Title Case on the 4th of July only. I will find a way to catch and save the little, black and green detritis unloosed through dental flossing.

The US economy will continue to expand at the fast pace since the Reagan administration through the second quarter. While new home construction will slow, service and other sectors will more than take its place.

                Back in 1989, the term Peace Dividend was all the rage. Peace Dividend referred to money Democrats could spend on welfare programs and pork as a result of the end of the Cold War. Today, Bush and Blair announced a new, better, and real dividend: the dividends of war.
After seeing the effectiveness of Bush&amp;rsquo;s policy in overthrowing Saddam, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has admitted trying to develop weapons of mass destruction &amp;ndash; but now plans to dismantle all such programs.

                With the possible exception of phrenology, nothing has produced more false, even fraudulent science than has environmentalism. Scientists of various sorts with otherwise solid credentials have, for years, allowed their own political biases bastardize results of scientific inquiry in order to &amp;ldquo;prove&amp;rdquo; what is not provable or lacks valid scientific evidence.
Moreover, people, particularly procreative baby boomers and the generation that followed, believes such nonsense without critical questioning. Author Michael Crichton, himself an environmentalist and scientist, has had enough.

                Wildwood, MO—A Wildwood man is disappointed that a home improvement project proved more difficult than expected.
William Hennessy began a project to remove wallpaper and paint the master bedroom in his house in the Westglen Farms subdivision in Wildwood. Shortly after starting the job, he learned that, what he expected to take to hours, would take more than a day.
“According to the guy at Home Depot, this was a slam dunk,” said the unemployed software architect.

Being the kind of man he is, he tried to hide them from the kids. I cant believe I fought two wars for this country, only to have those bastards send us all to hell, he told my mother in the kitchen.
