<p>Everyone sees the symptoms of <strong>football&rsquo;s death spiral</strong>:  empty stadiums. Crashed ratings. low quality. Criminals on the field. Some people call it &ldquo;the <strong>National Felony League</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frustrated fans look for better entertainment. Ticket sales remain high for one reason: stupid corporate executives. Stupid executives think it&rsquo;s still a status symbol to control lots of NFL tickets. It&rsquo;s not. Holding a lot of NFL tickets is a sign of stupidity. This isn&rsquo;t 1999, folks. American sports fans have moved on.</p>
<p>[Breitbart: <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2017/09/22/rasmussen-poll-34-less-likely-watch-nfl-anthem-protests/">34% Less Likely to Watch NFL Because of Anthem Protests</a>]</p>
<p>But none of that gets to the reason for football&rsquo;s demise.</p>
<h3 id="the-nfls-real-problem">The NFL&rsquo;s Real Problem</h3>
<p>The real reason for football&rsquo;s demise is complicated. Inferior quality of play is one. Terrible officiating another. And the league&rsquo;s stupid rules. Too many pads that become weapons. Outrageous prices designed to drive away retail fans and attract that corporate executives and their tax-free marketing dollars.</p>
<p>Those are reasons. But they&rsquo;re not the main reason for football&rsquo;s collapse.</p>
<p>The main reason is more human. Football&rsquo;s death spiral is all about the players and owners. And the fans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Television ratings for the NFL have been slipping since the beginning of the 2016 season</strong>. The league and observers have blamed a combination of factors, including competing coverage of last year’s presidential election, more viewers dropping cable television, fans’ discomfort with the reports of head trauma and <strong>the anthem protests</strong>.&rdquo; —<a href="https://boston.cbslocal.com/2017/09/23/president-trump-colin-kaepernick-anthem-protests/">CBS, Boston</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a sad story that reflects the divisions throughout the country.</p>
<p>T<strong>he NFL is dying because NFL insiders despise NFL fans</strong>. The players hate their fans. The owners hate their fans. The sponsors hate the fans. And the fans can sense it.</p>
<p>You know&rsquo;s the epitome of the NFL fan? Donald J. Trump.</p>
<h3 id="i-cant-stop-laughing-at-this-line">I Can&rsquo;t Stop Laughing at This Line</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Get that son of a bitch off the field right now . . .&rdquo; —President Donald J. Trump in Huntsville, Alabama</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DO47IkEkWQg">https://youtu.be/DO47IkEkWQg</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you love to see one of these NFL owners,&rdquo; President Trump told 20,000+ roaring fans in Huntsville, Alabama last night,  &ldquo;when somebody disrespects our flag, to say &lsquo;get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out. He&rsquo;s fired. He&rsquo;s FIRED!'&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the line everybody remembers. The line everybody loves. The vulgarity. The emotion. The voice of the voters who elected him. Perfectly delivered. Perfectly summarized. A perfect takedown of NFL flag desecrators and their owners.</p>
<h3 id="players-and-owners-hate-their-fans">Players and Owners Hate Their Fans</h3>
<p>Ever since failed quarterback Colin Kaepernick first took a knee to show is disdain for the country that made him a millionaire, some NFL players have made it clear: their values are not their fans&rsquo; values.</p>
<p>NFL owners, meanwhile, have been afraid to deal with their players&rsquo; contempt for the fans and the country.</p>
<p>But the people know. People know.</p>
<p>Our brains are wired to recognize contempt in others. We can see it. We can smell it. Our brains detect even the tiniest sign of contempt. Because contempt is a potential threat. And our survival as individuals and as a species requires early, reliable threat detection.</p>
<p>When NFL ratings and attendance began their decline last year, you can bet a major part of that decline stems from our brain&rsquo;s remarkable ability to detect a threat. A threat posed by the players who hate their fans. Hate their fans&rsquo; values.</p>
<h3 id="trump-exposed-nfls-contempt-for-americans">Trump Exposed NFL&rsquo;s Contempt for Americans</h3>
<p>Well, President Trump brought the players&rsquo; contempt to a head. Immediately after the president&rsquo;s remarks, NFL players and even <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/09/nfl-commissioner-lectures-trump-not-jackass-anti-cop-players-kneeling-anthem/">NFL commissioner Goodell</a>, took to Twitter to express just how much they despise their fans in places like Huntsville, Alabama.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/HAbdullah39/status/911417111335104512">https://twitter.com/HAbdullah39/status/911417111335104512</a></p>
<p>Former player Shaun King and others weighed in. Their brainless, selfish, anti-fan, anti-American tweets don&rsquo;t deserve space on my blog.</p>
<p>Americans have no reason to support the NFL any longer. The commissioner and the owners have taken their stand. Or, I should say, have taken their seat. They&rsquo;ve taken a seat to show their contempt for the flag, the country, our president, and their fans.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-live-without-football">You Can Live Without Football</h3>
<p>I did not watch a single NFL game last year unless football was the only thing on in a public bar or whatever. You can do the same. And, judging from this tweet, a lot of people stayed away from the Rams-49ers game on Thursday.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyThiry/status/911023808001085441">https://twitter.com/LindseyThiry/status/911023808001085441</a></p>
<p>Look at that empty stadium. For a rivalry game!</p>
<p>I was a St. Louis Cardinals football season ticket holder. I played high school football. I loved my great football heroes like <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2009/02/28/flow-thru-afterglow/">Jackie Smith</a>, Ottis Anderson, Terry Bradshaw, Lynn Swann, <a href="https://insider.foxnews.com/2017/09/05/nfl-legend-franco-harris-colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest">Franco Harris</a>, Jim Hart, Dan Dierdorf, Conrad Dobler. (I&rsquo;ll stop there. Too many to name them all.)</p>
<p>The Greatest Show on Turf era in St. Louis gave us so many great, lifelong memories. Football is such a great sport.</p>
<p>But the <strong>greed of the owners and players</strong>, the cowardice of their corporate sponsors, and the politicization of the game by players and owners alike has made football a disease to me. And to many others. Football disease.</p>
<p>[Franco Harris: &lsquo;<a href="https://insider.foxnews.com/2017/09/05/nfl-legend-franco-harris-colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest">Players in my day would have dealt with anthem protesters.</a>']</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sad to see football go. As crazy as that sounds, football is dead to me. Football is dead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for the fans to administer last rites. Time for the fans to say, &ldquo;get those sons of bitches off the field right now. Out. They&rsquo;re FIRED!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or maybe the good players will deal with those anthem protesters. Like the old days.</p>

                You thought Stan Kroenke wanted a team in Los Angeles? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. I think Stan is playing a long con. And I think it&amp;rsquo;s a brilliant strategy.
Los Angeles is a terrible market for football teams, but it&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic market for the NFL. It would be a perfect place to build a permanent home for the Super Bowl. Los Angeles has fantastic weather, great attractions, and a huge pool of football fans, fans of every team in the NFL.
