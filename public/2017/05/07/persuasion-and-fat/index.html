<p>&ldquo;Persuasion&rdquo; is part of my job title. When you&rsquo;re a persuasion professional, you get a lot of questions about persuasion. Some are sincere. Others are skeptical, like, &ldquo;Okay, persuasion boy, persuade me to give you a hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persuasion doesn&rsquo;t work like that. But it also does. Here&rsquo;s the thing: if you ask me to persuade you to give me a hundred bucks, <em>you already want to give me a hundred bucks</em>. You <em>want</em> my magic to work.</p>
<p>Likewise, those people who pay $122 to see David Copperfield in Las Vegas <em>want</em> Copperfield&rsquo;s tricks to work. They want to be dazzled, even if they&rsquo;re skeptical. They want to try to figure out the trick, but they&rsquo;d be disappointed if they did. They want to be fooled.</p>
<p>Persuasion isn&rsquo;t about fooling people. It&rsquo;s about helping people get what they want. Some people want to be amazed by David Copperfield defying the laws of physics. Some people want to give me $100. Persuasion, like stage magic, delivers.</p>
<p>So, let me state this unequivocally: you are free to give me $100 if you choose. I won&rsquo;t try to stop you. It&rsquo;s up to you. If giving me $100 means you&rsquo;ll understand persuasion, go ahead. But you don&rsquo;t have to give me $100 to understand how persuasion works. You can learn shortcuts. And I&rsquo;ve discovered one of the best shortcuts ever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://www.actionplan.com/pdf/BlairWarren.pdf">The One-Sentence Persuasion Course by Blair Warren. </a></p>
<p>Warren admits his method has been scientifically scrutinized. That means scientists haven&rsquo;t developed a theory to explain why Warren&rsquo;s method works. Then again, scientists don&rsquo;t why men find Eva Longoria attractive.</p>

LOS ANGELES, CA - JANUARY 30: Eva Longoria attends The 22nd Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at The Shrine Auditorium on January 30, 2016 in Los Angeles, California. 25650_012 (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Turner)[/caption]</p>
<p>Now that you know Eva Longoria&rsquo;s attractiveness lacks scientific theory, do you think she&rsquo;s ugly?</p>
<p>Of course not. And the lack of scientific theory to explain Warren&rsquo;s persuasion method doesn&rsquo;t make it ineffective. The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, as Nassim Taleb says.</p>
<p>Read on to find out where to get the One-Sentence Persuasion Course for free. Actually, I&rsquo;ll do it right now.</p>
<p>On one condition. Make that two conditions:</p>

<p>What do you think? Are those the five magic bullets for persuasion?</p>
<p>** encourage people&rsquo;s dreams
** justify their failures
** allay their fears
** confirm their suspicions
** help them throw rocks at their enemies</p>
<p>Psychologists and hypnotists call this &ldquo;pacing and leading.&rdquo; You align yourself with your patient or subject to build rapport. Then you lead them where they want to go. Where they want to go but have been unable to motivate themselves to get there.</p>
<p>Personal trainers do this. People go to personal trainers because they want to get healthier and look better. Personal trainers simply get their customers out of their own way.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Do you weigh 300 lbs? High blood pressure? Borderline diabetic? If so, you probably want to be thinner and healthier. You want to look good in a swimming suit. If you&rsquo;re a guy, you want Eva Longoria to find you attractive. If you&rsquo;re a girl, you want to look like Eva Longoria on the red carpet. But you don&rsquo;t know how.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not your fault. You&rsquo;ve been lied to about what you should eat. For decades, <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/02/05/why-are-you-letting-your-doctor-kill-you/">doctors</a>, <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/02/05/why-are-you-letting-your-doctor-kill-you/">dietitians</a>, the <a href="https://hennessysview.com/?s=diet">government</a>, and popular magazines have encouraged people to eat foods that make you fat and unhealthy. Society and advertisers have told you that comfort is the goal in life.</p>
<p>Both lessons were lies.</p>
<p>Natural fat is the healthiest food you can eat. Conversely, most fruits, all sugars, all grains, all starches increase disease and obesity. Food labeled low-fat? Very bad. Breakfast cereal, oatmeal, and orange juice make you sick. And fat. Sitting six hours a day is worse than smoking a pack a day. And breakfast doesn&rsquo;t matter. (You&rsquo;re better off with a Bulletproof coffee.)</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fat because you listened to doctors and the government. You&rsquo;re sick because you listened to the ads of furniture makers.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re overweight because <a href="https://www.burnfatnotsugar.com/diet-2.0-explained.html">society shames you into eating food that&rsquo;s bad for you</a>. How do I know this?</p>
<p>Last week I attended a conference at a great hotel in California. I watched a man eat a plate of scrambled eggs and bacon for breakfast. Then he got up, went to the buffet, and returned with a plate of muffins and fruit. And a tall glass of orange juice. As this man sat down, he announced, &ldquo;now for the healthy stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was wrong. The healthy stuff was on that first plate. This plate will kill him. Or give him Parkinson&rsquo;s or Alzheimer&rsquo;s. Either way, fruit and grains are the enemies. But no one ever told him.</p>
<p>No one told him because there&rsquo;s a lot of money in keeping people confused about healthy eating. Here&rsquo;s a short list of the organizations that benefit financially from bad dieting:</p>
<p>Healthcare</p>
<p>** Hospitals and their employees
** American Medical Association
** American Heart Association
** American <a href="https://thequantifiedbody.net/water-fasts-as-a-potential-tactic-to-beat-cancer/">Cancer</a> Society
** All those Type II diabetes organizations
** Pharmaceutical companies
** Cancer treatment centers
** Universities like Harvard and Washington University
** Proprietary diet companies
** Fitness centers</p>
<p>Agriculture</p>
<p>** Corn growers
** Sugar producers
** Grain growers
** Soy farmers
** Fruit growers</p>
<p>Retail and CPG</p>
<p>** Coke and Pepsi (and other soft drink makers)
** Beer brewers
** Kellogg&rsquo;s (and other cereal makers)
** Frito-Lay (and other snack makers)
** Jenny Craig and Weight Watchers
** Walmart (grain and sugar snacks)
** Grocery stores (higher margins on CPG than whole foods)
** Starbuck&rsquo;s (sugary drinks have higher margins)
** Fast food restaurant chains
** Sit-down restaurant chains</p>
<p>Those lists are just off the top of my head. Every company, industry, and association mentioned benefits from bad health. If most Americans adopted a high fat, low carb diet tomorrow, all of those entities would be in deep financial trouble. And so would their lobbyists.</p>
<p>The reason the government tells you to eat food that causes horrible diseases is simple: <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/02/08/government-diet-makes-you-fat-and-kills-you/"><strong>lobbyists write the bills</strong></a>. Have you ever heard of the National Measles Foundation? No. Because measles has been pretty much wiped out. As has small pox. When a disease diminishes, funding for research disappears. A lot of people make good jack working for the various heart, cancer, and diabetes associations. They need a steady increase in those diseases to justify their existences. And the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/22/official-advice-to-eat-low-fat-diet-is-wrong-says-health-charity">government is always happy to legislate disease into existence</a>. For a fee.</p>
<p>If you want to be thin and healthy with a brain that works great, it&rsquo;s as easy as <a href="https://www.burnfatnotsugar.com/diet-2.0-explained.html">a low carb, </a>high fat<a href="https://www.burnfatnotsugar.com/diet-2.0-explained.html"> eating system</a>. You can kick it off with a 3-day water fast. (No, it&rsquo;s not dangerous to go three days without food. It&rsquo;s dangerous not to.)</p>
<h3 id="what-i-just-did">What I Just Did</h3>
<p>I just gave an example of Blair Warren&rsquo;s method. Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p>** <strong>Encourage people&rsquo;s dreams</strong>: I asked if you want to be thin and healthy, to look good in a swimming suit, to look like Eva Longoria. Or to date Eva Longoria. That&rsquo;s the dream.
** <strong>Justify their failures</strong>: &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not your fault.&rdquo;
** <strong>Allay their fears</strong>: No, it&rsquo;s not dangerous to go three days without food. High fat, low carb diet can reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, Parkinson&rsquo;s, diabetes, and other chronic diseases.
** <strong>Confirm their suspicions</strong>: The pop-science &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; eating recommendations are not just wrong but destructive. Eating what the government tells you is dangerous. Large, well-funded organizations use government to maximize their financial success. Everything labeled &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; and &ldquo;low-fat&rdquo; is bad for you.
** <strong>Help them throw rocks at their enemies</strong>: Disease and obesity are everyone&rsquo;s enemies. So are know-it-all, do-gooder organizations that shame you for eating eggs and rib eye steaks. I just loaded you up with a pocket of rocks to knock them in the head.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. Blair Warren&rsquo;s one-sentence persuasion course. The easiest way to master the art of persuasion. It&rsquo;s a simple formula for practicing pacing and leading.</p>
<p>Finally, $100 seems like a lot to ask. Most of this information is free on the Internet. It&rsquo;s just that no one wants you to know about it. Except me and few others. If you feel guilty about getting this lifesaving information for free, you can just send ten dollars to my PayPal account:</p>

                If you&amp;rsquo;re sick and fat, it might not be your fault. You listen to your doctor. You follow government diet guidelines. You eat more fresh fruit and vegetables. You cut down on animal fat. You eat more grains.
And you just get sicker and fatter.
You&amp;rsquo;re told it&amp;rsquo;s your fault. But it&amp;rsquo;s probably not.
You might be a good mom or dad who wants your kids to learn healthy eating habits.

                You probably know that I admire Scott Adams quite a bit. He&amp;rsquo;s brilliantly predicted everything Trump has done. And he&amp;rsquo;s not finished dazzling us with his prediction skills.
Yesterday he made a prediction of how we&amp;rsquo;ll kill ISIS. It isn&amp;rsquo;t pretty. He&amp;rsquo;s not advocating what will happen. He&amp;rsquo;s just telling us what will happen.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to offer an alternative end to ISIS. It&amp;rsquo;s one I&amp;rsquo;ve advocated for attacking radical Islam since 2001.

                When a person declares himself &amp;ldquo;NeverTrump,&amp;rdquo; he thinks he&amp;rsquo;s making a political statement. Or a moral one. But he&amp;rsquo;s not. He&amp;rsquo;s making a psychological commitment that&amp;rsquo;s very difficult and painful to break.
Identity is the highest, most powerful form of persuasion. Identity also drives our decisions in parts of the brain we don&amp;rsquo;t really have conscious control over. I realize many conservatives reject brain science, but, for those of you who are open to learning, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain as best I can in a moment.
