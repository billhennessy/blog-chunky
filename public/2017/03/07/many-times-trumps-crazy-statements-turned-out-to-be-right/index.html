<p>I know his critics can&rsquo;t read my blog. (Literally, they can&rsquo;t. They have a psychological problem that prevents their brains from processing information that&rsquo;s inconsistent with their beliefs.) But for those of you who want to be right with the truth instead of just right with your own opinion, this will be a great post to forward to your friends. I&rsquo;ll make it easy with clickable Twitter boxes like this one.</p>
<p>[Tweet &ldquo;This will make you look smart.&quot;]</p>
<p>I googled &ldquo;Trump was right.&rdquo; I got a lot of links back. I was embarrassed to realize I had forgotten most of these cases. Maybe you remember these now. Before you decide Trump&rsquo;s crazy wiretap story is, well, crazy, you will want to recall all the other times Trump&rsquo;s crazy assertions were true.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recently, Trump talked about all the migrant-caused violence in Sweden. The media and Swedish politicians said he was crazy. But <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/23/sweden-democrats-trump-was-right.html">he turned out to be right</a>. In fact, we&rsquo;ve since learned that Swedish politicians routinely <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/03/sweden-muslim-classmates-gang-rape-14-year-old-girl-remain-school-rapists-victims/">cover up rape, murder, and mayhem</a> that&rsquo;s perpetrated by migrants. So Trump probably knew from intelligence reports that there was more crime in Sweden than Sweden admits. But <a href="https://legalinsurrection.com/2017/02/two-important-testimonies-that-trump-was-right-about-sweden/">Trump was right about terrorism in Sweden</a>.</li>
<li>TrumpÂ calls CNN and New York Times and Washington Post &ldquo;fake news.&rdquo; The pundits roar. But courts and journalism watchdogs agree with Trump. As <a href="https://theblacksphere.net/2017/02/cnn-forced-to-pay-lawsuit-over-fake-news/">The Black Sphere pointed out, a court recently fined CNN</a> for pushing fake news that hurt someone. Washington Post claimed Russia had hacked our electric grid, which was a total lie. And <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/03/06/donald-trumps-crazy-ivan/">New York Times published a story that the government wiretapped Trump&rsquo;s aides</a>, then another story that<a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/03/07/how-newspapers-lie/"> the government didn&rsquo;t wiretap Trump&rsquo;s aides</a>. Trump was right about CNN and others being fake news.</li>
<li>When Trump said it was too early to tell who was behind a string of threats against Jewish centers, the Anti-Defamation League, and others attacked Trump, <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2017/03/03/analysis-jewish-bomb-threat-arrest-shows-trump-was-right-not-to-jump-to-conclusions/">some accusing Trump supporters of the threats.</a> But the arrest of far-left St. Louis journalist Juan Thompson, a Bernie supporter, proved Trump was right to withhold judgment until all the facts were in.</li>
<li>Trump said the Yemen raid by Navy SEALs was a success. <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/03/05/john-mccains-most-evil-sin/">John McCain and the media said it was a failure</a>. Then we blew up a bunch of terrorists in Yemen using intel gained in that raid. <a href="https://therightscoop.com/cnn-just-confirmed-trump-was-right-about-yemen/">Trump was right about Yemen</a>.</li>
<li>General Motors flatly denied Trump&rsquo;s allegation that GM was moving Chevy Cruze production to Mexico. The media jumped in on GM&rsquo;s side. But on January 19, CNN Money admitted Trump was right. GM was laying off 1,200 Americans because of its move to Mexico. <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/19/news/economy/donald-trump-chevy-cruze-mexico/">GM lied, Trump was right</a>.</li>
<li>Remember when Trump said he would save thos Carrier jobs in Indiana? Everyone said he was nuts. He saved most of them, didn&rsquo;t he?</li>
<li>Trump called himself a conservative person. Professional conservatives howled and called him a charlatan. Yet, so far, Trump has been the most conservative president since Calvin Coolidge. (<a href="https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/trump-is-off-to-a-stunningly-conservative-start/">Sorry, Mr. Reagan</a>.) And he&rsquo;s just getting started!</li>
<li>Trump said he&rsquo;d appoint a conservative to replace Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. Pundits and professional conservatives said he&rsquo;d pick a liberal. Cruz said he&rsquo;d pick Merrick Garland. But Trump picked Neil Gorsuch, a favorite of Ted Cruz.</li>
<li>Last year, Buzzfeed found <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarahburton/trump-was-right-handed?utm_term=.duq9dvzmd#.kqLGLDVgL">7 crazy pop culture predictions Trump was right about</a>. Turns out Trump is pretty good at predicting who will stay married and who will get divorced.</li>
<li>Trump was lambasted (still is) for saying a lot of drugs come into America from Mexico. But <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-williams2/trump-was-right-on-mexica_b_13143932.html">even HuffPo admits Trump was right</a>.</li>
<li>The media and Mexican groups attacked Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; assertion that 80 percent of young women crossing Mexico from Central America to reach the US were raped along the way. Turns out <a href="https://www.aim.org/aim-column/trump-was-right/">Trump was right and the Mexican activists were wrong</a>.</li>
<li>Nobody believed Trump when he said he could win the Republican nomination as late as April 2016. I was in DC in April hanging out with political friends. They all expected the GOP to find some way to dump Trump and appoint Cruz or Rubio as the nominee. Trump wrapped up the nomination less than a month later.</li>
<li>None of the major media, major pollsters (save for Rasmussen), political pundits, or Hollywood celebs gave Trump a snowball&rsquo;s chance in hell at winning on November 8. But Trump divested all of his stock holdings in June of 2016 because &ldquo;I felt very much that we&rsquo;d be winning.&rdquo; As the Dallas News put it: <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2016/11/09/trump-right-wrong-need-understand">&ldquo;Trump was right, we were wrong.&quot;</a>Â Showtime calls the election the biggest political upset of all time. And until November 9th, so many people called Trump&rsquo;s confidence a sign of craziness.</li>
</ul>
<p>[Tweet &ldquo;All the times Trump was right&rdquo;]</p>
<p>(<a href="https://hennessysview.com/2016/11/11/how-donald-trump-completed-the-tea-party/">Read how Trump completed the Tea Party</a>)</p>
<p>Look, there are probably another 100 cases where Trump said or tweeted something &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; that turned out to be right. You&rsquo;re probably thinking of several that I missed. But I&rsquo;m tired of writing. Almost every time Trump says something outlandish, he&rsquo;s right and everyone else is wrong. I&rsquo;m used to it. You might want to just start nodding your head at everything Trump says. He&rsquo;s usually right. And always right about the important stuff.</p>
<p>Before you decide that Trump&rsquo;s wiretap tweets were crazy, think about this list. And think about Scott Adams&rsquo;s point: <a href="https://blog.dilbert.com/post/158110404781/wiretapping-word-thinking">presidentsÂ have access to more information than anyone alive</a>. It&rsquo;s possible that Trump knows something about those wiretaps that you and the New York Times editorial board do not.</p>
<p>If history is any guide, expect to see this headline in a few days: &ldquo;<a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/03/06/donald-trumps-crazy-ivan/">Trump Proven Right On Wiretaps</a>.&rdquo;</p>
