                            <p>Today, President Trump changed the game. He changed the <a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/02/11/slouching-toward-the-climax/">Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma (coordination) into a game of Chicken (competition)</a>.</p>
<p>Lifer Republicans have no experience with games of chicken. They were raised on coordination games.</p>
<p>By changing the game to Chicken, Donald Trump greatly increased the chances <strong>that phony Paul Ryan&rsquo;s healthcare will PASS</strong>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why briefly.</p>
<p>Psychologically, people always think they have more time. Republicans, in particular, believe time is limitless. Lifelong Republicans think they can delay any decision until the decision they want is a given.</p>
<p>But Trump said in effect, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/325577-trump-delivers-ultimatum-to-gop-on-obamacare-repeal">&ldquo;vote tomorrow. I&rsquo;m moving on.&quot;</a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very strong move. And it scared the shit out of Republicans. Even Freedom Caucus snowflakes who accused the President of ignoring them. (Not all Freedom Caucusers are snowflakes. But the pansies who complained about their lack of access to the President should be driven out of the caucus and out of the Congress. They&rsquo;re weak.) Enough Republicans believe that it&rsquo;s this or nothing. It&rsquo;s this or Obamacare forever. It&rsquo;s this or total failure of the last 8 years of Republican politics.</p>
<p>So my prediction is that this pathetic bill will pass.</p>
<p>I hope, but don&rsquo;t predict, that House Republicans will remove Paul Ryan from the Speakership. Paul Ryan is a weak and failed Speaker. This bill should have been ready on January 20.**<a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/03/20/healthcare-strategy-beats-hyperventilating/"> Ryan&rsquo;s selfishness</a> caused this crisis. **</p>
<p>For the record, I also hope the bill passes. Not that I like the bill. But I think it can be improved with future legislation. If it fails, we will live with Obamacare for the next 100 years. Too many people worked too hard for too many years to let that happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://hennessysview.com/2017/03/20/healthcare-strategy-beats-hyperventilating/">Strategy, not hyperventilation</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. Nothing in this post should be construed as an endorsement of Paul Ryan. I think Paul Ryan is a disgusting, weak person. But I believe Trump. He walks away from negotiations that are going nowhere. When he says &ldquo;take it or leave it,&rdquo; he means. He has a history.</p>

                You might have noticed that my predictions have been remarkably accurate lately, have you not?
For example, on Sunday, May 1, I predicted Ted Cruz would suspend his campaign after getting trounced in Indiana. Two days later, Cruz lost the Indiana primary to Donald Trump 53 to 36. At the time I wrote, many pundits and pollster still believed Cruz could win that Indiana race, and everyone believed Cruz was telling the truth when he said repeatedly he was staying in the race to Cleveland unless Trump reached 1,237 delegates before then.

                Nothing happens in politics by accident. Every move has an angle. Some players are better than others. Paul Ryan and Donald Trump are two of the best players alive, but one is better than the other. We&amp;rsquo;ll see that tomorrow.
House Speaker Paul Ryan has set aside Thursday for meetings with his party&amp;rsquo;s nominee for President. Every nominee for president meets with the senior members of his party&amp;rsquo;s Congressional caucus, so there&amp;rsquo;s nothing odd about the meeting.

                Every prediction about Trump has been wrong. Except for two. Ann Coulter and Scott Adams predicted Trump would win the nomination and, eventually, the White House in a landslide. They were right.
World leaders expect Trump to win, and they are lining up to make all his crazy assertions look like brilliant predictions.
Former Mexico president Vicente Fox apologized to Trump, and Trump graciously accepted. That&amp;rsquo;s a sign that Mexicans expect Trump to become the next US president.
